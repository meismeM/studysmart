Definition of Common Terms Used in Crop Production\n1.2. \nAgriculture is defined as the deliberate cultivation of crops and rearing \nof animals.\nBefore the introduction of agriculture, societies survived by hunting animals \nand gathering plants for food. Studies indicate that hunter-gatherers had to be insightful in order to survive. Today, hunting animals and gathering plants for food may be viewed as primitive and unskilled activities. However, the hunter-gatherer life-style has not completely disappeared with the expansion of agriculture. Even today, there are hunter-gatherers in areas where the land and climate conditions do not favour deliberate crop culture. Desert areas, Arctic region and pockets of tropical rain forest are examples of such places. Agriculture involves the deliberate cultivation of crops and the rearing of animals. Before development of agriculture, people started to domesticate animals mainly for food production. Later, people started to breed animals in order to produce non-food materials. Crop and livestock production has gradually become the major means of survival for societies.  \nShifting cultivation: is a form of agriculture in which an area of ground \nis cleared of vegetation and cultivated for a few years and then abandoned for a new area.\nEarly crop production involved temporary cultivation of land called shifting cultivation. This required clearing trees and cultivating the land for just one or two seasons. Abandoning the land cultivated after it had been cultivated once and shifting to a new location was common. Unlike the familiar practice known today, crop cultivation and animal rearing Brainstorming 1.1\nAnswer the following questions independently before reading the \nnotes and share your answers with your classmates\n1.

The cultivation \nof land in a settled agriculture involves the use of yield enhancing practices. Crop management practices such as using manure, fertilizer, the construction of soil bunds for erosion control, and the optimized use of water have now become associated with cultivation of land in a settled agriculture. This means that a settled agriculture is a more advanced activity than traditional shifting cultivation.\nSubsistence farming: the practice of growing crops and raising livestock sufficient only for one’s own use, without any surplus for trade.\nSubsistence farming refers to a situation in which a farmer produces crops and livestock sufficient only for household use without any surplus for trade.  The major aim of this type of farming is to produce crops and animals for the farmer’s own consumption. Subsistence farming often requires simple techniques that often do not go beyond a household capacity.  If there is any excess production, it might be stored for times of poor harvest or sold to generate income for the household. \n1.2. The Origin of Domesticated Crops\nIt is not possible to know the exact place and time that agriculture began. However, growing crops and rearing animals in a specific area is a deliberate activity that took a long time to develop. Evolution of agricultural economies transformed wild plant species to the fully domesticated ones. \nIt is possible that religion may have influenced agriculture as particular \nanimals and plants were kept as they were required for religious practices. \nThere may be many reasons why the hunter-gatherer culture gradually \nchanged to agriculture and this change took place over thousands of years.\nNo strong evidence is available on how hunter-gatherers chose their \nfood sources. A fair estimate could perhaps be that the hunter-gatherers were influenced by certain features of the plant species they selected as food sources. This selection as food source probably influenced"

Ease of harvest, wide \navailability and ease of transport to the desired place could have been some useful features hunter-gatherers considered in their plant selection. Plants selected for food could also have been those available with high predictability and seasonal distribution. Possessing climatic tolerance, having good flavour and suitable grain size could also have been other desirable characteristics of plants considered for selection. The wild plant species that hunter-gatherers consumed include wild rice, grass species, wild oats and legumes. Legumes used by hunter gatherers are known to have been toxic. This suggests that the societies detoxified and used the legumes as food. Their detoxifying skills were based on trial and error. Presumably, they used the poisonous substances they extracted from such toxic legumes as poisons on arrowheads in hunting. This discovery may suggest that in hunter-gatherer life style survival required insight. \nRoot crops were widely used as food by hunter-gatherers particularly in \nthe tropical region. Wild onions and sweet potatoes were also important food sources for hunter-gatherers. Hunter-gatherers used hunted animals and plant species such as coconut, oil palm and olive as sources of oil.\nGroup discussion\n• In a small group, discuss the criteria that hunter-gatherers could have used to select their food sources.

Crop plants \nprovide food for humans and feed for livestock. Crop production is mainly \ndetermined by the crop type, and the environment in which it is grown. \nAgriculture involves selection of a crop species, selection of specific types of crop and land preparation before planting. It also involved planting at the right time, protecting the crop from diseases and pests and adopting techniques to increase productivity. Primitive agriculture used primitive tools that had a low efficiency and were not easy to operate. Over time, agriculture has evolved into a more complex process with enormous technological advancement. The technological advancement in agriculture resulted in: \n\t\naccess to improved seeds \n\tbetter production practices \n\tbetter harvesting and storage facilities\nModern agriculture also involves crop rotation (rotating or shifting between different crops in different growing seasons, as opposed to planting the same crop on the same plot every year), fallowing (leaving a plot of land free of crop growth for 2 or three seasons for soils to recover) and use of various soil conservation practices to control soil erosion.

These have enhanced the productivity of modern agriculture. Regions with better economic capacities are able to adopt advanced technologies in agriculture.\nFigure 1.1. a) manual soil cultivation b) animal drawn plough \nOne of the first technological changes in agriculture was the transfer of some tedious manual work to draft animals. The draft animals were used to prepare and plough land and transport materials. The development and use of agricultural machineries has further reduced the labour requirement. This enables an individual farmer to operate a large farm. Agriculture in industrialized regions is often classified into three Eras:\n Mechanical Era (1930 - 1950)\n Chemical Era (1950 - 1970) and\n Biotechnology/Information Technology Era (1970 - present)\nAgricultural productivity in industrialized regions has increased as a result of the use of industrial technologies. Land preparation and planting can be completed at the best time with machinery. Crop diseases, weeds and pests can be easily controlled with agricultural chemicals. These modern crops have higher yields and improved resistance to diseases and pests, which has contributed to improved agricultural productivity in these regions.Agriculture in less developed regions, (e.g., in sub-Saharan Africa), is often traditional with draft animals still in use for cultivation, transport and other agricultural activities. As a result, agricultural productivity in these regions remains very low compared to industrialized regions."

There are different agro ecologies in \ndifferent regions of the country and a wide range of crop types are grown. Ethiopia has about 51 million hectares of arable land, of which only about 20% is cultivated, mainly by smallholders.

As shown in the table, between 1961 and 2000, there was also an increase in cultivated area (million ha). This can be associated mainly with the expansion of cultivated area as shown in table 1.1 and to some extent, increased use of agricultural inputs. However, there is limited evidence to support a parallel increase in productivity per unit area cultivated. The yield level is mainly limited by the recurrent droughts and climate changes. Achieving food security requires an increase in yield and a decrease in yields variability. The general yield level in the country is low compared to the international standards.

Classification of crops into C3 and C4 plants\nCrop plants transform carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere into \ncarbohydrates by the process of photosynthesis .\nDepending on their photosynthetic pathway, crop plants can be classified \ninto either C3 or C4 types. In the C3 photosynthetic pathway, the first stable carbon compound formed from assimilation of carbon dioxide contains 3 carbon atoms. In the C4 photosynthetic pathway, the first stable carbon compound formed from CO\n2 assimilation contains 4 carbon atoms. For \nC3 plants, rates of photosynthesis increases with increased levels of CO2. \nC4 plants have a mechanism to accumulate CO2 inside the chloroplast and \ntherefore their photosynthetic rates do not increase with an increase in CO2 \nlevels. This means that C4 plants can reach higher photosynthetic rates at low levels of CO\n2 while C3 plants cannot. This is because C3 plants \ndo not possess a CO2 accumulation mechanism. Moreover, C4 plants are \nmore efficient in using water and require less nitrogen compared to C3 plants. Generally, C4 plants have higher photosynthetic rates at a given temperature, compared to C3 plants. Examples of C3 crops include: wheat, barley, teff, soy bean, ground nut and sweet potato.

Cropping Systems \nCropping system refers to the types and sequences of crops and the \ndifferent practices used to grow them. Different cropping systems require different types of management and possess their own advantages and \ndisadvantages. There are several forms of cropping  systems, including \nmono cropping, mixed cropping (including intercropping and relay planting) relay planting and crop rotation.\n1.5.1.  Mono cropping\nMono cropping is growing a single crop type in a given plot of land. Mono cropping is commonly practiced in large scale commercial crop production. Some smallholder crop production systems may also practice mono cropping. In this system, a single crop species occupies the whole farm. One disadvantage of mono cropping is the risk of total crop failure, as a result of crop pests and diseases. Mono cropping also results in reduced soil fertility. On the other hand, mono cropping has the advantage that it enables farmers to use uniform management and increases the efficiency of practices like planting and harvesting.\n1.5.2.  Mixed cropping \nMixed cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land. Mixed cropping reduces the risk of total yield loss as the farmer is not dependent on the yield of only one crop. Mixed cropping also allows for more efficient use of soil nutrients, water and light radiation. In addition, mixed cropping helps to break the cycle of crop pests and diseases which are very common in mono cropping systems. The most common types of mixed cropping are intercropping and relay planting. Brainstorming 1.3\nAnswer the following questions. Compare your answers with your \nclassmates’.\n1.

As shown in Figure 1.5, intercropping often involves the planting of cereal crops such as maize alongside legumes. Relay and intercropping systems provide better soil cover and reduce soil erosion. Crop diseases also spread less rapidly in relay and intercropping systems compared to the mono cropping systems.\n   Figure 1.5. Intercropping\nRelay planting Relay planting is where a second crop is planted after the first crop has grown alone for a certain period. This system reduces the risk of total crop failure as the farmer doesn’t depend on the yield of one crop only. \n1.5.3.  Crop rotation   \nCrop rotation is the practice of growing different crop species on the same plot of land sequentially. For example, planting maize in the first season can be followed by bean production in the next season, and cultivation of teff  in the third season. The sequence might be repeated many times. Rotations could also involve more crop species depending on the environment. The objectives in crop rotation include improving soil fertility, especially if legumes are included in the rotation, and controlling of some crop pests and diseases. On the other hand, crop rotation may also develop resistant diseases and weeds. Besides, changing climates may be a challenge to crop rotation."

It is the knowledge \nthat local communities have accumulated over generations of living in a particular geographic location. It is often referred to as ‘home grown’ \nor ‘local knowledge’ that is unique to a particular culture. Indigenous \nknowledge often develops independently of scientific knowledge. It often includes beliefs and traditions intended to preserve, communicate, and contextualize indigenous relationships with culture and landscape over time. \nIndigenous knowledge often develops from agricultural production related \nproblems. These problems might include land becoming less fertile (land degradation), soil erosion, changes to the climate, as well as working with the natural physical features of an area (topography). Other issues such as farmers having only small landholdings along with social and cultural settings of the community.\nCommunities with indigenous knowledge possess knowledge about their \nnatural resources and environment based on a long period of observation and experience. For example, indigenous knowledge about natural resource management is vital among the Gumuz society. They believe that natural resources are a gift, a blessing and creation of the Yamba (God). They also believe that natural resources have been sources of livelihood for the past, are sources of livelihood for the present generation and will continue to be the sources for future generations. Conserving the natural resource has an impact on the soil fertility, on the rainfall pattern and on soil moisture and temperature. Overall, it improves crop productivity .Brainstorming 1.4\nDiscuss the following questions in pairs.\n1. What is indigenous knowledge? How different is indigenous \nknowledge from scientific knowledge?\n2. What indigenous knowledge is used in your locality to produce crops?\n3. Is indigenous knowledge sufficiently exploited in your locality? If not, what are the reasons?"

Some of the factors are \nunder the farmer’s control. Others cannot be fully controlled by the farmer. Selection of crop site is the principal factor that determines crop production. Crop selection requires knowledge of the crop requirement. Knowledge of soil properties, water and other growth factors is important in crop site selection.

Similarly, a locust invasion cannot be planned \nfor ahead of time.\n Field crops\nField crops are crops grown on a wide scale mainly for human consumption. \nThese crops are annuals which means that they complete a life cycle in a single season. The major field crops are classified into two major groups called cereals and pulses (legumes).\nCereals are crops with grass characteristics grown mainly for their edible \nseeds. Cereals can grow in a wide range of environmental conditions, from low lands to highlands and in different soil types and climates. Cereal crops are monocots, which means that their seeds have a single cotyledon (embryonic leaf). As a result, during emergence they produce a single leaf.These crops contain:\n\tcarbohydrates\n\tproteins \n\tfats\n\tfibers\nThe five major cereal crops produced in Ethiopia are teff, maize, wheat, barley and sorghum.\n2.1.1. Teff (Eragrostis abyssinica (Zucc.) Trotter)\nTeff is a cereal crop that is native to Ethiopia where it is used as staple \nfood. It is used as livestock feed in South Africa. Teff is a very nutritious cereal crop preferred by many people to other cereal crops. Moreover, teff  does not contain gluten, which causes allergy in some people. Maize and sorghum are other examples of cereals that do not contain gluten. Teff is now a high value cereal food crop being used even outside Ethiopia. In addition to the seeds that are consumed as food by humans, teff straw is also a valuable feed for animals. It is a high value crop with high price compared to other cereals and has a high acceptability by consumers. Also, teff can be stored for a long time. Compared to other cereals, teff is less affected by pests and diseases. These qualities make the crop reliable with"

The crop can grow at altitudes ranging from the sea level to 2800 meters above the sea level.  The major teff producing areas have altitudes between 1500 and 2800 meters above the sea level. Teff performs well on loam and clay soils, which have high nutrient contents and water storage capacity. Teff ranks first in terms of the area of production in Ethiopia.\nLand preparation: teff has smaller grain size than most cereals. As a \nresult, it requires very smooth seed bed. For teff production, the soil is usually cultivated 4 or 5 times and leveled before planting. Soils used for teff production should be free from weeds and other crop pests. Due to the small size of the seeds, teff plots should be smooth with no large soil clods. Usually animals are driven on the surface to achieve the smooth seedbed that teff requires.\nPlanting: teff is often planted by broadcasting seeds (seeds are randomly \nspread over the farm) on the smooth plots. Row planting, where seeds are planted on the plots with regular spacing, is also becoming common these days using a spacing of 20 cm between rows and drilling the seeds inside planting rows. After planting, branches could be dragged across or flock of animals could be driven on the surface of the soil to cover the seeds. Shallow furrows are usually made at an interval of 3 to 6 meters for draining (removing) excess moisture from the teff plots. The most common planting time is July/August. Teff is usually harvested in November/December in the highland areas and earlier in mid and lowland areas.\nFertilization : 60 kg nitrogen and 26 kg phosphorus per hectare is usually \napplied for teff production. Fertilizer application should be determined by \nthe soil fertility level of the teff plots. Fertile soils may not require as much fertilizer. \nWeed and disease management: teff competes poorly with weeds"

Usually manual weeding is done about a month after planting. Chemicals are also used to control different types of weeds. For example, the herbicide 2,4-D is used to control broad leaf weeds in teff fields. Teff could also be affected by fungal diseases when excess water accumulates in the soil.\nHarvesting:teff crop is ready for harvest when the stems and panicle turn \nyellow. Average national yield for teff is about 14.6 quintals (1.46 t) per hectare. Nutritionally, teff is a rich source of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. The crop is also a good source of mineral nutrients like iron, calcium and magnesium. \n2.1.2. Maize ( Zea mays L. )\nMaize most likely originated in Central America. From there, it was \nintroduced to other parts of the world including Latin American and Africa. Maize is widely produced in various agro ecologies. It has the following beneficial features:\n\tgives high yield per unit area\n\tthe seeds are covered by husk, protecting it from rain and birds\n\tdoes not shatter (lose seeds up on drying) so can be harvested at late maturity as there is no shattering loss\nMaize is mainly produced for its seeds to be used as a staple food. It is also used as animal feed when green or after drying. Maize residues (the straw and cobs) are used as firewood in rural areas. Maize is also used in the production of starch and oil in industries. \nProduction and managementMaize grows in a wide range of environments with suitable altitudes \nvarying from 500 to 2400 meters above sea level. In Ethiopia, maize yields per unit area are the highest compared to other cereals. Maize ranks second to teff in area of production in Ethiopia. Loam soils that do not accumulate excess moisture are better for maize production. Maize is planted as a mono crop or as a mixed crop with legumes such as haricot beans and cereals, such as teff."

Sometimes, planting can be done after plowing the soil only once or twice if chemicals are used to control weeds.\nPlanting: row planting is usually used at a spacing of 25 cm between seeds \nand 75 cm between planting rows. Depth of seed sowing is from 5 to 7 cm. The most common maize planting time is at the start of the rainy season (March to April).\nFertilization : farmers usually apply 41 kg nitrogen and 20 kg phosphorus \nper hectare for maize. However, fertilization rates should be determined by \nthe level of fertility of the soils used for maize production.\nWeed, insect pest and disease management: weeds are controlled either \nby manual weeding 2 to 3 times during the growing season or using chemical \nherbicides to prevent and kill weeds. Two main types of herbicides are used: pre emergence (such as Atrazine, which are used before the weeds emerge aboveground) and post emergence (like 2,4-D, which are used after the weed has emerged aboveground). Common insects that attack maize include maize stalk borer, aphids, army worm and weevil.\nMaize can also be affected by fungal (rust, gray leaf spot and blight) and \nviral diseases such as strike virus. These can be controlled by using crop rotation instead of mono cropping and modifying the planting time to reduce the damage from these diseases.\nAround a month after planting, earthing up (piling soil around the plants) \nhelps to reduce maize plants falling (lodging) due to wind.\nHarvesting: There are different maize varieties which require different \ntimes to reach maturity. Early maturing varieties could reach harvest in 3 months while late maturing ones could take up to 5 months to mature. Maize is ready for harvest when the seeds develop a black layer at the bottom tip. When harvested, maize grains often have a moisture content of about 25% and for suitable storage, the grain moisture has to be reduced to 13% or lower by harvesting when grain moisture content is close to this value or drying the grains so that the required moisture content is achieved. Average national yield of maize is 32.5 quintals (3.25 t) per hectare."

Pulse Crops Production and Management \nPulses are seeds of legume crops that are grown mainly for their edible \nseeds. These crops are consumed as dry seeds rich in protein or as immature pods used as vegetables. Pulses are also used as a source of animal feed. Pulse crops are dicots, meaning that the seeds contain two cotyledons (embryonic leaves). Many pulses assist with nitrogen fixation. This means that these plants fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil through their root nodules. This nitrogen is then available for subsequent crops. For this \nreason, pulses can be used in crop rotations to improve the fertility of soil. \nPulses can also be used in mixed cropping with cereals in order to improve the yield of the cereal crop. In Ethiopia, pulses are mostly produced without mineral fertilizer application. In some cases, organic fertilizers, such as animal manure are used. Compared to cereals, soil cultivation is generally minimal – soil may be cultivated once or direct planting takes place, with no soil cultivation. These factors, together with poor weed control in grain legumes, have resulted in low yields from these crops in Ethiopia. The major pulse crops in Ethiopia are faba bean, field pea and haricot bean.\n2.2.1.

Haricot beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)\nHaricot bean (common bean) originated in Mexico and spread to other \nregions of the world. It is produced for its edible seeds. The immature pods of the haricot bean are consumed as a vegetable. It can also be used as animal feed. Haricot bean grows well in most soil types and in altitude between 1400 and 2000 meters above sea level. Haricot bean is usually grown as mono crop or mixed with cereals such as maize and sorghum. It is grown in rotation with teff, maize and sorghum. Haricot bean seeds can be red, brown, white or gray. It is an important export crop in Ethiopia.\nPlanting: haricot bean can be sown by broadcasting or in rows. When in \nrows, commonly used spacing is 40 cm between rows and 10 cm between plants. In intercropping, usually the spacing between plants is maintained (10 cm) and the rows of haricot bean come between rows of maize or sorghum. Animal manure is usually used for fertilization."

These crops can be classified \ninto oil crops, fiber crops and sugar crops. Examples of crops from these categories will be discussed in the following sections.\n3.1. Oil Crops Production and Management \n3.1.1. Sesame (Sesamum indicum L. )\nSesame is an oil crop believed to have originated in Africa. Sesame is \nmainly produced for its oil, which is used in cooking food and also in the production of other foods such as margarine. Oil extracted from sesame is also used in the production of paints and cosmetic products like soaps. By-products of sesame oil extraction are also used to produce animal feed. The crop is adapted to semi-arid, lowland areas with an altitude of up to 1200 meters above sea level. This is mainly because it requires relatively high temperatures (25 to 27 \nOC) during the growing season. Sesame is \nvery sensitive to excess water and though generally drought-tolerant, it is sensitive to extreme shortages of water. High rainfall during flowering reduces yield because flowers drop off the plant. Sandy loam soils that do not accumulate excess moisture are suitable for the growth of this crop.\nLand preparation and planting: sesame is sensitive to weed problems \nand therefore the fields should be clean from weed seeds during land preparation. Since the seeds are small, soils should be free of big clods and the seedbed should be as smooth and clean as possible.  Sesame is often planted by broadcasting or row planting at a spacing of 50 cm between rows and 10 cm between plants. \nWeed management: Sesame is especially sensitive to weed competition \nand damage during early growth stages. Weeding should start early from Brainstorming 3.1. \nDiscuss in pairs.\n1. Which products you use do you think come from industrial crops?\n2. List some examples of such products."

The crop is ready \nfor harvest when one third of the leaves, stems and pods (structures that contain the seeds) turn yellow. When harvest is delayed, the pods break and there will be loss of seeds. The national average yield for sesame is 7.4 quintals (0.74 t) per hectare.\n3.1.2. Noug (Guizotia abyssinica L.)\nNoug is an oil crop that originated in Ethiopia. The country is the largest \nproducer of noug. It is mainly produced for its oil and it accounts for about half of all food oil production in the country so it is an important source of good quality food oil. Noug oil can also be used for the production of paints and soaps. Residual material left after the oil is extracted is used as a source of animal feed. Noug grows well in areas with altitudes of between \n1800 and 2000 meters above sea level. Noug does not require high rainfall \nand can even survive with only residual soil moisture after rains stop. It also has the capacity to tolerate excess soil moisture. This crop performs well on clay-dominated soils that often accumulate excess water.\nLand preparation and planting: the seedbed needs to be well prepared \nto make sure that sown seeds germinate well. Noug is commonly sown by broadcasting. Alternatively, it can be planted at a spacing of 25 cm between rows and drilling of seeds within the planting rows at a depth of about 2cm. The crop is usually planted in June or July. \nWeed management: the crop requires at least one weeding at early growth \nstage, but as it grows, it becomes very competitive against weeds, it can even dominate them. However, noug can be affected by parasitic weeds like dodder and orobanche. These weeds have to be uprooted and burned before they start producing seeds. If they are allowed to produce seeds, they will spread through the farms and the yield loss will be very high.\nHarvesting: the crop is ready for harvest when the leaves change from \ngreen to brown and yellow. Harvest must be completed at the right time because late harvest causes loss of seeds by shattering. Harvesting too early results in deformed seed shape which can reduce the quality of the"

Fiber crops such as cotton are also sources of vegetable oil for cooking and industrial purposes.\n3.2.1. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)\nCotton is a fiber crop that produces lint, which is a soft fluffy fiber that \ngrows in a ball (protective case) around the seed.  The lint is used as raw \nmaterial in the textile industry. Cotton requires a warm climate to grow and \nis generally drought-tolerant. It does not perform in areas with high rainfall \nbecause the lint in the cotton boll will become discolored. This will reduce \nthe quality of the yield.

Cotton is a major raw material for textile firms. There were more than 50 garment or cloth manufacturers, and 14 textile factories in Ethiopia in 2021. The numbers of textile manufacturers, both local and international, are increasing and hence the demand for cotton is increasing. \nThe contribution of the textile industry to foreign currency earning is \ngrowing. The supply of cotton to the textile industry from within Ethiopia is not sufficient to meet the demand. That is why textile manufacturers import raw cotton from other countries. In order to meet the demand of the local textile industry, it will be necessary to increase the production of cotton in the country. \nLand preparation and planting: cotton seeds for planting are usually \ntreated with acid to remove the hairs on the seed. The crop is often planted in rows at a spacing of 1 m between rows and 30 cm between plants. The seed sowing depth is about 8 cm.\nWeed and insect pest management: weeds are one the major problems that \nlimit cotton production in Ethiopia. Starting with a clean seedbed before planting can reduce this problem. Manual weeding at least twice within one month after the weeds begin to emerge is recommended. Chemicals are also used to control weeds in cotton farms.\nHarvesting: cotton is ready for harvest when at least half of the plants \nhave their bolls burst open. Cotton requires 6 to 7 months to mature. After harvest (picking), cotton goes through different stages before it is used to make clothes. The first step in cotton processing is drying and ginning of the cotton from the cotton plant. Ginning is the process of separating seeds and plant debris from the cotton fiber. Then the cotton fibers are cleaned for dust and other impurities.\nOnce the cotton fibers are cleaned, they are transported to textile mills \nwhere spinning takes place to twist the raw cotton fibers into a thread. This is followed by weaving the thread into fabric or cloth. There were more than 35 mills producing fabrics (woven and knitted clothes) for the export"

Sisal (Agave sisalana L.)\nSisal is a fiber crop believed to have originated in Central America. It \nis widely cultivated in the tropics. Sisal is mainly produced for its hard fibers that are used in textile industry for the production of ropes, sacks and carpets. Sisal fibers are also used in paper making and in the textile industry for polishing clothes. Sisal stem is also used for fencing, fire wood and as a house construction material. Sisal fiber is derived from the leaf of the plant. The plant is drought-resistant and can be grown as a rain-fed crop. This means that it can be grown using only rainfall for water and no other irrigation is required. Sisal can grow in a wide range of altitudes from sea level up to 1800 meters above sea level.\nLand preparation and planting: sisal is propagated vegetatively. This \nmeans that a new plant will grow from the cutting of the parent plant. In sisal reproduction occurs through suckers growing around the plant or bulbils (young produced from buds in the flower stalk). The suckers or bulbils are first grown in a nursery. When they are about 40 cm high, they will be transplanted to the field. Often row planting is used at a spacing of 2.5 m between rows and 80 cm between plants.\nHarvesting: it takes 2 to 3 years after transplanting for the first harvest of \nleaves. After that, leaves can be harvested annually. Leaves are ready for harvest when they reach a height of 1.2 m and width of about 15 cm. After harvest, sisal leaves are scraped manually or using machinery to separate the fibers from the leaf. This process is called decortication. The fiber is then washed and dried. The dried fiber is mechanically brushed to straighten"

Sugar Crops Production and Management\nSugar crops are crops used as raw materials in the production of sugar. \nSugar cane and sugar beet are examples of these crops. In Ethiopia sugar cane is by far the most significant crop used for the production of sugar .\n3.3.1.  Sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum L.)\nSugar cane is a tropical and sub-tropical crop grown mainly for the \nproduction of sugar. Sugar cane requires a long warm season to grow well. Cane is the raw material mainly used in sugar production. The juice extracted from sugar cane is processed into sugar for human consumption. Some part of the residue from sugar cane processing is used as animal feed. The dark liquid produced from sugar cane juice is called molasses. Molasses is used in the production of ethanol. The fibrous residue left after the extraction of the juice is called Bagasse. It is used in the production of papers and plastics. It can also be used as firewood. The green top (leaf) of the plant is directly used as animal feed. \nThe sugar cane crop takes from 14 to 18 months between planting and \nfirst harvest. After the first harvest, the plant regenerates from the roots of the first harvest and is ready for harvest in about 12 months. The second harvest is usually called ratoon crop. Ratoon crop harvests are smaller than the first harvest. Ratoon harvests are limited to 2 or 3 times after the first planting. When ratoon harvests are over, new sugar cane plants are planted on the field. The sugar cane plant usually requires fertile soils. If grown on"

The top part of young sugar cane stems is used as planting material. The stem cuttings used as planting material should be free from diseases and pests. The average size of the stem cuttings used for planting are often about 30 cm, with each cutting having at least 2 or 3 buds. Sugar cane is planted in rows with about 1.6 m. average distance between rows. The planting materials are placed end to end in a planting furrow and covered with soil layer of 2 to 5 cm.\nFertilization : The level of fertilizer required depends on the level of soil \nfertility. Sugar cane requires large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer to grow \nwell. However, excessive Nitrogen fertilizer application can delay the maturity time of the cane. \nWeed and insect pest management: for sugar cane, 3 weeks after planting \nand 14 weeks after planting are critical periods. Weed competition could cause high yield losses in this period. Weeds have to be removed manually or using chemical methods. Various weeds are known to be problems for sugar cane production in Ethiopia. Control methods often involve manual weeding, cultivation and, in some cases, the use of chemicals. Insect pests like sugar cane borers, army worms, locusts and termites are major problems in sugar cane production in Ethiopia. Control measures for insect pests include pre-planting cultivation that could destroy some insects, and use of insecticides. Fungal diseases like smut and bacterial disease like Ratoon Stunting Disease are common. The use of disease-resistant sugar cane varieties, removal of the diseased plants and using chemicals are often recommended remedies. \nHarvesting: sugar cane usually matures in about 14 to 18 months from the \nplanting time. The harvest practice includes removal of the leaves and the top of the plant before cutting the stem. Sometimes, controlled fire is used to remove dry leaves before cutting the stem.   The stem is then transported to the processing facility."

Domestication is the conversion of wild animals to domestic use. Domesticated animals are animals that have been selectively bred to live alongside humans. Most of the domesticated animals familiar to us today were domesticated not long after people began farming and living in permanent settlements. This was probably between 8000 and 2500 BC.\nDo you know the difference between species and breed? \nA species  is a largest group of animals that is capable of interbreeding \nand producing fertile offspring. A breed is a specific group of animals \nwithin a species that are visibly similar in most characteristics, which \ndistinguish it from other breeds of the same species. A species is often \ncomposed of several breeds. \n4.1.1. Farm Animals in Ethiopia and Their Description\nEthiopia has a huge resource of farm animals. They are composed of the \nmammalian, avian and honeybee species. Cattle, sheep, goats, camels, \ndonkeys, horses and mules are the major farm animals in the mammalian category. The Avian category includes chicken, ostrich and turkey. Ostrich and turkey are not widely used in Ethiopia. Stinging honeybees are the most important bee species in the country.

The food trickles from the crop into the bird’s stomach where digestive enzymes are added to the mix and physical grinding of the food occurs. The stomach in chickens is subdivided into two parts, the proventriculus (glandular stomach) and the gizzard. The proventriculus is the organ producing acid and enzymes. The gizzard is the muscular stomach and pacemaker of gut motility.

Importance of Animal Production \nAnimal production (also called animal husbandry) is the keeping of farm \nanimals for human use. Farm animals have several roles in the farm ecosystem. They are primarily reared for the production of consumable foods. The pulling power of draught horses, donkeys, camels and oxen is the other form of services obtained from farm animals. Some by-products are also used for different purposes such as clothing, feed, fertilizer or medicine. Beyond these functions, farm animals also play important economic, cultural and social roles in the society. \n ►Food and nutrition supply\nOne essential purpose of keeping animals is food production and supply. Several animals convert high-fiber feeds into edible food that is consumed by humans. Many food products are derived from farm animals. More than thirty-four percent of global food protein supply comes from farm animals. Animal products are also rich sources of fats, minerals and vitamins. They are essential for a healthy and balanced diet. Brainstorming 4.2. \nWork in pairs\n1. What products of farm animals do you know in your area?\n2.

Some animals can be used to carry out farm operations. Bullocks and camel draw working machinery like ploughs, harrow and ridge. Some animals are involved in crop husbandry (e.g., seeding with drills) and crop processing (e.g., threshing). Camels, donkeys and horses are used to transport people and goods in many parts of the developing world.\n ►Clothing\nAnimal by-products such as skin, wool and fur are used for the preparation of clothing.

A person’s wealth, in a traditional society, is usually assessed by the herd size owned by the individual. Moreover, livestock are kept for various socio-economic reasons. Savings and investment, security and insurance, stability, and social functions are examples of socio-economic reasons for keeping livestock.

The main feed resources are natural pastures and crop residues. These supply more than 90% of the annual feed. They have, however, poor feeding value in terms of crude protein (3 to 6%), energy value, minerals and digestibility. \nThere is also a high seasonal variation. Feed resources are exhausted quickly \nin the dry season. Animals are maintained with less feed than their usual requirement. This affects their productivity and reproductive potential. The use of agro-industrial by-products (e.g., wheat bran, oil seed cakes and molasses) as feed is very limited. This is because of unavailability, expensiveness and lack of awareness of their importance as animal feed. \nFeed shortage in quantity can be mitigated through expanding commercial \nfeed production (improved grasses, legumes and formulated feeds). The use of young and succulent grass (at 30% flowering stage), mixing mature grass with legumes, chopping matured grass and mixing it with molasses, etc. are some strategies in feed quality enhancement. \n ►Genetic factors\nThe animal production system in Ethiopia can be characterized as a traditional management system. This system uses local breeds. The local breeds are well-adapted to the local conditions. They are resistant to many tropical diseases. They can survive and are produce on low quality feed resources. Indigenous animals are also known for their quality product in terms of yolk color, milk fat and meat taste. However, indigenous animals are usually considered poor in their productivity. Proper feeding, selecting those with good production, crossing with exotic breeds, etc. are recommended for successful genetic improvement.\n ►Animal diseases and parasites\nDisease is one major constraint in animal production.

Internal and external parasites are additional burdens of the sector. Proper feeding, vaccination and isolation of sick animals can be used as prevention mechanisms. Equally effective methods of preventing disease are treating sick animals, proper cleaning and management of the animals and their housing. \n ►Traditional production system\nMany farmers in Ethiopia use a traditional production system and have no knowledge of modern animal production. Draft animals are the major focus in mixed farming (i.e., farming both animals and crops on the same farm). Similarly, milk is the main focus in pastoral farming (keeping or grazing of animals). This means meat production is considered as by-product. Pastoral farmers consider their livestock as a means of capital accumulation. Livestock are sold if the need arises or when a shortage \nof feed and water occurs. This is due to the absence of entrepreneurial \nawareness. Recurrent capacity building, demonstrating the modern way of farming, availing credit facility and strong extension system are possible means of enhancing knowledge of modern animal production. \n ►Socio-economic constraints\nSocio-economic constraints are a lack of services and facilities that are vital for livestock development. Weak extension services, shortage of appropriate technologies and poor infrastructure are some examples of such constraints. \nThere is a huge scarcity in electric power supply. Electricity is used to \npreserve perishable items such as meat, milk, drugs and vaccines. The scarcity in transport facilities hampers the flow of livestock and their products. A lack of credit and saving services is another challenge. \nFarmers have little or no access to training on modern animal rearing \npractices. There is also inadequate flow of market information. Examples of social constraint is that it is a taboo to eat goats’ meat in some areas. Similarly, fish is not eaten in some parts of the country. Products of cross breed animals like egg, meat, milk, etc. are also not preferred for food in certain areas in the society."

Livestock types are the locally known ones. The feed depends on the condition of the climate. There is a severe shortage of pasture and fodder during the dry season. Compared to intensive farming, productivity in extensive farming tends to be much lower, growth rate slower, and time to maturity much longer. However, the system requires less labour per unit area. There are different forms of extensive production system (See Figure 4.12.).\n ►Pastoralism is an extreme example of extensive farming where \nherders move their animals to get pastures from occasional rainfall. \nPastoralism allows communities to feed themselves in areas that do \nnot support other forms of agriculture. Pastoralism is a livelihood system and a way of life for millions of citizens in Ethiopia. Feed \nand water shortage, poor market outlet, disease and number oriented \nlivestock production are the major problems in the pastoral production system. Pastoralists are of two types. \n Nomads have no permanent home, but move from place to place with their herd and flocks in search of water and feed for their \nanimals. Movement is usually without much long-term planning. \nThis is mainly found in arid and semi-arid areas. The production system is largely based on increasing animal number. \n Transhumance have a permanent home to which they return each year, but some take the flocks and herds away from their \npermanent settlement for some part of the year. It is characterised \nby the seasonal and recurring movement of livestock across regions. Seasonal grazing areas and routes for livestock movement \nare fixed. The aim of this system is to make use of often distant \npasture during rainy season and what remain after harvest around farm houses. \n ►Agro-pastoral system is a system in which livestock are important \ncomponents of the farming system.

Livestock are kept for draft, sale and \ngeneration of other primary products (milk, meat and eggs). \n ►Ranching is the practice of raising large number of animals on a"

There is relatively little labor input compared to \nthe land and number of animals being farmed. Ranching is modern \nalternative to pastoralism. Ranchers commonly raise grazing animals such as cattle and sheep. They are raised for meat, dairy or wool. \nFunction of livestock and products is to provide cash income and for \nmaking profit. \n ►Mixed farming is a system whereby both crops and livestock are raised on the same farm. In a mixed farming system, the farmer may \nkeep cow for milk, goats and sheep for meat and wool, and grow \nfood crops and hay to feed animals. Equines (horse, mule and donkey) are used for transport. While manure from the animal dungs serve as \nsource of manure to improve the soil fertility. Natural pasture and \ncrop residues (e.g., teff, barley and wheat straws) are the major feed resources. Mixed farming system is subsistence-oriented, which \nmeans that livestock/crop are produced for family consumption rather \nthan for market. \n4.4.2. Semi-intensive System \nSemi-intensive system is a type of animal production system that lies \nbetween the extensive and intensive systems. The system is characterized by high input and high output relative to extensive production system. This systems is usually located around the periphery of large towns. They are commonly practiced by small scale producers. In a semi-intensive system, animals are reared for family consumption but the surplus can be sold for income generation. This system can easily be intensified.\n4.4.3. Intensive System\nProduction systems in the intensive system are characterized by high \ninputs with high output. This is a modern farming system where livestock \nare raised at high stocking density with a relatively high inputs and \noperations. The production systems are market-oriented, which means that livestock is raised to be sold. The system often located near highly populated urban centers. The environment for the animals can be modified to suit all specialized breeds and production systems. The type of animals can be crossbred or exotic."

Feed is the \nmost important factor that determines animal performance and profitability in many cases. The largest operating cost in a livestock production enterprise is the feed cost. It varies from 50% to 80% depending on the operating area in animal production. Farmers must supply the right amount of feed \nto the animals. Overfeeding is wasteful and costly. Underfeeding will \ndecrease animal performance and profitability. The feasibility of livestock enterprises always depends on proper animal feeding and nutrition.\nLivestock feed resources available in Ethiopia are natural pastures, crop \nresidues, improved forages and agro-industrial by-products. These are \ndescribed below.\n5.1.1. Natural Pasture\nNatural pastures are naturally occurring grasses, shrubs and tree forages \n(edible portions of plants). In natural pasture, forages grow naturally on their own and are feed upon by farm animals. Natural pastures usually provide more than 60% of livestock feed. Grazing is the least expensive way to deliver feed to animals. Natural pasture is of good quality in the wet season and so animals have plenty to feed in order to maintain their productivity. Pasture usually diminishes in dry seasons.

Natural pasture  \nSome common management practices in pasture to ensure continuous supply \nof grasses and legumes to livestock include grazing land management, fertilizer application, oversowing legumes, etc. Application of fertilizers (e.g., urea and DAP) in the pasture ensures rapid and succulent growth of pasture because of increase in the fertility of the soil. Weeds, pests and diseases should be prevented to ensure rapid growth of pasture crops. The correct number of animals should be placed on a pasture to graze. Overgrazing does not ensure increased productivity of pasture.\n5.1.2. Crop Residues Crop residues are the remaining portion of the crops after harvesting the \nmain crop for human consumption. Several forms of crop residues provide the majority (greater volume) of livestock feed. These include straws, stovers, cobs, hulls, chaffs, etc. Crop residues are generally low in crude protein, energy and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). They are fibrous and of low palatability and digestibility. Supplementing them with improved forages (forage legumes and browse species), grains and other concentrates is often recommended to maximize animal productivity. Their quality can also be improved by physically (e.g., chopping) or chemical methods such as treating with ordinary urea fertilizer. Crop residues generally are not suitable for pig and poultry feeding.\nFigure 5.2. Examples of crop residues: a) wheat stubble, b) millet straw , \nc) maize stover, d) barley straw, e) teff straw"

Forage Crops\nForage crops are plants cultivated for their edible vegetative portions and \nused in fresh or preserved forms of feeding livestock. There are two basic types of forage crops. These are grasses and legumes. Grasses serve as the best and cheapest bulk feed for ruminants. Grasses produce more yield per unit area than legumes. Grasses are higher in fiber than legumes. Rhodes grass, Sudan grass and Elephant grass are some examples of grasses used as animal feed. Legumes contain protein, vitamins and minerals than grasses. Legumes are usually used as a cheap source of supplement when feeding crop residues and natural pastures, for improved productivity of animals. Examples of legumes used for feed are Alfalfa, Vetch and Sesbania sesban. The nutritive value and digestibility of forage crops generally declines as they mature. Cultivated forage crops can be cut and fed fresh or they can be conserved for the dry season.

They usually supplement crop residues such as straw. The commonly used agro-industrial by-products are flour milling by-products, oil seed cakes, molasses and brewery by-products. They are rich either in energy or protein, compared to pastures and crop residues.\n\tFlour milling by-products: are generally very palatable and are readily consumed by all classes of farm animals. Wheat bran, wheat \nmiddling and rice bran are some examples of milling by-products used as animal feed. Brans are pleasant-tasting feed to animals. They are also laxative  animal feed.

Cereal middlings and rice  polish are lower in fiber and \nhigher in energy than brans. Forage production can be an attractive business\nSeveral new reforms have been implemented to encourage new business \nideas in Ethiopia. Also, a lot of emphasis is being placed on animal farming. Forage production is a profitable business idea because feed shortage is a major challenge for animal farming in Ethiopia. This business has a good market demand throughout the year as well as growth potential. Hence forage production in a large plot can be profitable. However, proper planning and dedication are a must to build a successful venture. Several forage species can be cultivated. Farmers can choose any one or several of them. In this case, farmers must have a basic knowledge of agronomic practices along with the marketing network for selling. Grass-legume mixtures produce the best in terms of the yield and nutritional quality, and therefore the highest profit margins. Farmers can sell green forage, good quality hay as well as planting materials (seed, cutting, splits and seedlings) from their pasture land and improve their income. This venture is unusual in Ethiopia. A group of youth and women can join the venture with some support from the government, including land and regulated short-term loans."

Protein is essential for animals’ healthy growth, \nmaintenance and reproduction. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. They are essential for the formation of animal tissues. Protein can be of plant or animal origin. Plant proteins in livestock feed can come from oil seed cakes/meals, pulse and legumes. Fish meal, meat scraps, etc. are sources of animal protein for livestock. There is no storage of protein in the body. This makes it necessary to provide animals with the amount of protein needed each day.

The method is used to calculate the portion of two feeds needed to meet either the protein or energy requirements of an animal. To make this tool work, one of the feeds used must be higher in Metabolisable energy (ME) or CP than the desired level and the other feed must be below the desired level.The following steps show how to calculate for CP using the Pearson Square method. Step 1: Draw a square. Insert the % of CP desired in the final ration in the middle of the square. Step 2: Place the name of the first feed and its % of CP in the upper left \ncorner. Place the name of the second feed and its % of CP in the lower left corner. Step 3: Subtract the desired % of CP (middle of the square) from the feed CP % (on the left of the square) across the diagonal and add the results to the right side of the square.\n• top left  – middle  = bottom right\n• bottom left – middle = top right \nNote: disregard the negative or positive value of the numbers.Step 4: Calculate the weight of each feed by adding the two figures on the right and then dividing each number on the right by this total and multiplying by the weight of feed required. The results of the calculation show the amount of each of the two feeds that should be combined to produce a balanced ration.

The aim of hay making is to reduce the moisture contents of green crops from 70 - 90% to 15 - 20%. This process of reducing moisture is called curing. Curing is normally accomplished with energy provided by the sun and wind. It is a method to preserve grasses, legumes and fodders for feeding at a later stage. \nHay can be stored satisfactorily in a bale or tripod system (See Figure \n5.7.). Various options exist for storing hay bales, be they small squares, large squares, rectangular bales, or round bales. The baling process makes the compact cubical bundles of the forages.

Introduction to Animal Genetics and Breeding\nGenetics is the study of heredity, which is the passing of genetic \ninformation and traits from parents to offspring. Genetics include the study of genes and their effects on living organisms. Genes are small sections of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that are coded for specific traits. DNA is the molecule that contains the genetic code of organisms. DNA is inherited by offspring from their parents. Genes are found in chromosomes. Animal geneticists have identified elements within genes that can enhance animal growth, health, and the ability to utilize nutrients efficiently. These genetic advances can increase production and reduce environmental impacts. Animal genetics is one of the pillars of livestock development alongside animal health, animal nutrition and husbandry issues such as animal housing.\nAnimal breeding indicates the mating of selective animals for purpose of the \nenhancement of particular characteristics in subsequent generations. These characteristics are usually chosen with the aim of increasing production and profitability. Animal breeding ensures a continuous improvement of farm animals’ generation after generation. Different animal traits are measured and the best animals are used as parent animals. In this way, breeders provide livestock farmers with a next generation of animals. Thus, animal breeding helps in accumulation of superior genes and elimination of the less desirable genes.\nThe objectives of animal breeding are to:\n\tincrease animal yield or productivity\n\timprove the desirable quality of animal product\n\tproduce disease-resistant animalsBrainstorming 6.1\nGenetics and Breeding\nWhat did you learn about the following in your biology class? \n\tAnimal genetics \n\tAnimal breeding"

Breed Improvement Methods\nTo make livestock production profitable, productivity per animal (e.g., \ngrowth rate, milk yield and egg number) needs to be increased. Productivity of animals can be increased by better feeding, better health care and better management of the existing animals. However, genetic improvement also plays an important role. Genetic improvement is based on the principle that the products (such as milk, meat, and wool) and services (e.g., transport, draught power or cultural services) provided by animals are functions of their genes and their living environment. \nThere are three methods of genetic improvement applied in farm animals. \nThese are breed introduction, selection and breeding.\n6.2.1. Breed Introduction\nBreed introduction is bringing high-quality breeds of livestock into the \nfarm or a country. High-quality breeds of livestock have a high productive capacity and other desirable characteristics. The introduction of high-quality breeds of livestock can be from another farm or another country. Before introducing such animals from another farm/country, it is important to be sure that the breeds possess higher quality characteristics than the local ones. There are different breeds of farm animals around the world. These are the local breeds, exotic breeds and the cross breeds.\nIn Ethiopia, local breeds are usually small animals. They mature slowly and \nare poor producers. They are, however, adapted to the local environment and are resistant to diseases. Exotic breeds are breed that are not native to Ethiopia, and these are often larger animals. They also mature early. They are good producers but they may not adapt to the local environment and fall victim to various diseases. To overcome these issues, the exotic breeds can be mated with the local breeds. This may help to obtain cross-breeds which possess the most desirable qualities of both exotic and local breeds.\nAdvantages of breed introduction\n Characteristics which are not originally present in the local breeds \nare introduced"

Selection\nGenetic improvement can be achieved by a proper selection. Selection \nis used as a tool for livestock improvement. Selection is the process of \nallowing genetically superior animals to be parents of future generations \nwhile culling others. Culling is the removal of animals which do not \nperform at the desired level, from the herd. The animals retained have \ncertain desirable characteristics which make them more productive. \nAnimals with desirable characteristics are selected. Selected animals make \nup the breeding stock. The breeding stock should pass the good qualities to their offspring for better performance, e.g., higher milk production or growth to improve the herd. Selection process repeated for many generations increases chances of formation of desirable qualities in an animal. Selection increases occurrences of desirable genes and decreases that of the undesirable ones. There are two types of selection.\nNatural selection: This is the process in which animals that are better \nadapted to their environment get a better chance of surviving and producing more offspring than those that fail to adapt themselves. The offspring of the adapted animals will be more adapted than their parents. Animals that are unable to adapt cannot survive or reproduce.\nArtificial selection:  farmers select and mate the best animals. This \nincreases the health and productivity of animals. There are several methods \nof artificial selection."

Breeding\nBreeding involves the development of animals by transferring inherited \nqualities from parents to offspring. This is achieved through mating. There \nare different methods of breeding, which can be categorized as related or \nunrelated breeding systems.\nIn-breeding: This involves mating of more closely related animals than \nthe average of the population from which they come, e.g., the mating of \nfather to daughter, son to mother or brother to sister. In-breeding helps to produce inbred lines that can be used for cross breeding to produce hybrid vigour. However, it can produce offspring with undesirable characteristics because recessive genes show up. This is known as in-breeding depression.\nLine-breeding: This involves the mating of distantly related animals, e.g., \nmating between cousins. It has the same disadvantages as in-breeding, but it takes a longer period for undesirable traits to appear (i.e., for in-breeding depression to occur). It is used to consolidate traits for a particular outstanding ancestor. Most of the high-quality commercial characters developed recently have been a result of line-breeding.\nOut breeding: This is the mating of unrelated animals within the same \nbreed. Out-breeding is the opposite of in-breeding. It produces offspring with a greater vigor and productivity.\nCross breeding: This is the mating of proven quality animals of same \nspecies but different breeds. This is because parental animals differ in gene composition. Cross-breeding results in breeds of animals with higher production capacity than any of the parents. This phenomenon is called heterosis or hybrid vigor. It brings about a greater rate of growth in an offspring. Cross-breeding produces individuals that can withstand climatic variation in the environment. It increases disease resistance in offspring. It also promotes higher yields of eggs, meat and milk in offspring."

Farm Animal Reproductive Technologies\nReproduction techniques are becoming more and more important and \nnecessary for modern animal breeding. Reproduction techniques are used to make safe and efficient breeding possible. \nBreeding programs can be improved and optimized through the use of \nreproductive techniques. Reproductive techniques allow the dissemination of genes of interest and increase the reproductive capacities of animals. Over the years, various biotechnology methods are used in improving the breeding stock of animals. Artificial insemination and embryo transfer are some examples of these biotechnology methods.\n6.3.1. Artificial Insemination (AI) \nArtificial insemination is the process of collecting sperm cells from male \nanimals and depositing them into the reproductive tract of a female (vagina, cervix or uterus) by a method other than natural mating. It is the most important reproduction technology for genetic improvement in domestic animals. The semen is collected hygienically from superior males. The semen containing spermatozoa are carefully handled, diluted and stored in a freezer at a temperature of -196\n oC in liquid nitrogen. The semen stays \nthere until it is required for use. A liquid nitrogen tank is used for preserving and storing semen for an extended period of time. \nSuccess in insemination timing is dependent upon a good heat detection \nprogram. Effective AI work needs accurate herd supervision and heat detection. Oestrus in females is identified by the following signs:\n loss of appetite\n constant vocalizations\n restlessness\n rubbing up against herd-mates\n lips of the vulva become redder and more moist than usual\n swelling around the vulva\n a thin mucous discharge from the vulva"

Insemination is carried out in a sheltered area to eliminate unfavorable conditions such as wind, dust and rain. Instruments must be sterile. Cow which is in heat is well controlled in crush. The inseminator will get ready by wearing a plastic apron, gumboots and gloves. The semen straw after thawing (keeping the semen straw in tepid water for a minute to convert the freezed semen into liquid and the sperms become motile) is loaded in a sterilized AI gum and is covered with a plastic sheath (Figure 6.1). The inseminator will insert the gloved left hand into the rectum after applying the soft soap or other lubricant on the glove and back racked the animal, and the hand is further inserted and will catch hold the cervix through rectal wall. The AI gum loaded with semen straw is passed. \n \nFigure 6.1. Steps in Artificial Insemination Process in Cattle"

In embryo transfer, the donors are highly productive or are superior animals. The recipients are an inferior in productivity. Embryo transfer has proved to be a powerful technology in genetic improvement of farm animals. Embryo transfer is used to disseminate desirable genes from superior female animals and from various species (horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs). \nThe embryo transfer process in cattle begins with cows receiving a hormone \ntreatment to produce more than one ovulation (egg) at a time (Figure 6.2).

Animal Identification and Record Keeping \nMaintaining herd performance records is one of the best management \ntools for a successful genetic improvement program. Performance records help producers identify areas of weakness in the overall herd/flock performance. Information on animals’ performance help a farmer to make informed decisions about flock management, the selection of new breeding stock and culling low performing animals. Tracking animals that have been treated with medication can be made easy through identification and record keeping. This means that keeping records of medical histories of individual animals can also be used when making culling decisions. Recording of phenotypic data (i.e., an individual’s observable traits, such as height and color) is the major driving force for genetic progress. This genetic progress is very much dependent on the accuracy of the data.  \nIndividual animal identification allows producers to keep records of an \nanimal’s parentage, birth date and production records.

It is quite important to have proper housing system for animals to protect them from health problems and enable them to perform better. Good feeding and breeding will not result in a maximum production if farm animals are not kept in a good house. Housing should be constructed in such a way that it furnishes adequate comfort and protection from climatic stresses and potential diseases. \nProvide some environmental controls: The purpose of keeping animals \nin a house is to improve the environment. Good housing allows the farmer to better control the inside environment. Farm animals respond to changes in environment (temperature, relative humidity, air movement, sun radiation and rain) through changing their behavior, and their productivity or reproduction efficiency also drop. For example, at high temperature feed intake of animals is reduced to regulate body temperature. This results in reduction in quantity and quality of milk, meat, egg, and wool production. Reproduction is also adversely affected by high temperature range. Protecting animals from all these environmental changes or conditions would help to achieve the desired production level throughout the year . \nControl of diseases and external parasites: Diseases and parasites are among the profit liming factors in animal production especially in the developing countries. A well ventilated and dry house or shelter would help to prevent the buildup of pathogens. Good animal housing will facilitate the implementation of strict sanitary control measures while being easy to clean and disinfect to minimize animal mortality through elimination of external parasites like ticks, mite and lice. \nEfficient use of feed and labor: Careful planning of buildings and Brainstorming 7.1\nPurpose of housing\n1.

Efficient communication between feed stores and feeding points such as feed troughs could be made through well-designed house. It also makes easier other routine management activities such as watering, breeding, egg collection, milking, and cleaning. Well-designed house can also protect laborers from various environmental stresses, which has an economic implication.\nSafeguard against predators: Another major reason to keep farm animals \ninside is to protect them from predators. All farm animals are prey animals.\n7.2. Types of Farm Animal Housing \nDifferent farm animals housing systems are available. Each housing \nsystem has its own advantages and disadvantages. Housing type should be chosen depending upon the type of animals, climate conditions, local tradition, availability of building materials and economics. For example, conventional barn system is not suitable to hot and humid climates. Loose housing system is more suitable to Ethiopian conditions. \n7.2.1. Conventional barns or houses\nin this housing system are kept in constructed houses. Animals are \nmanaged intensively and protected from adverse climatic conditions. The barns are constructed completely roofed. Their walls are complete with windows or ventilators at suitable places. The continual air flow keeps the area comfortable for animals. Animal and worker care for animals are less exposed to adverse weather conditions. Barns remain hygiene and disease prevalence is less. They are suitable in heavy rainfall and temperate climate.\nConventional barns for dairy cattle and deep litter poultry housing are \nexamples of these housing type (Figure 7.1). In conventional barns, dairy cattle often kept tied in large stalls and cannot walk around the barn. The cows are provided with feed and water. They are also milked in the same barn. There is no need to have a separate milking parlour (i.e., a barn in which cows are milked at milking time). Tie stalls have largely been phased out due to animal welfare concerns.

Loose housing \nLoose housing are animal houses where the animals are allowed to move \nfreely and have free access over the whole area of the building or pen. Loose housing systems provide more comfort and free movement for both workers and animals. Thus, it improves productivity and welfare. In loose housing, animals of equal line of production and similar age are usually kept in groups Group size depends on type of animal and size of farm. Self-feeding is practiced in loose housing system. Animals have freedom to walk around the free stalls at will. Animals feel comfortable. In loose housing, less bedding will be required and less manure will have to be removed. This type of housing is very suitable for tropical climate (most parts of Ethiopia). All types of livestock can be housed and managed under loose housing. The loose housings are cheaper to construct, easier to expand and flexible in utility."

The farm headquarters is situated at the center. Free range system allows farm animals to run free in a large area throughout the year. There should be an attendant moving with animals to protect them from predators and thievery. The animals are less intensively managed than in modern farms. The farmer has less control over the animal’s environment, but the animals get more exercise and more time to graze. This type of farming is suited to animals that are not handled daily, such as beef cattle and fattening sheep. Free-range systems enable farm animals’ greater freedom to express their natural behaviour.\nFigure 7.3.

Guidelines for Site Selection \nWhen planning an entirely new farm, the choice of location for constructing \nthe building is the first consideration. Location refers to the place where animal housing is placed in relation to soil structure, drainage, road access and proximity to other farm houses, etc. The following factors should be considered when selecting site for farm animal housing.\n\tTopography and drainage: Topography means the arrangement of \nthe features of an area. The topography of the site should ideally be elevated but fairly level with no abrupt slopes. Farm animal houses should always be located in a well-drained area for effective drainage. The soil should be porous and the slope gentle so that drainage is efficient. \n\tFeed, water and veterinary services: A good source of clean water supply should be available cheaply and in plenty. A year-round supply of water is essential for the animals, sanitation, workers and residences and fire protection. The site should be located in areas where there are adequate veterinary services and where feed is available at a cheaper price.\n\tAccessibility:  The site should be preferably located where good market \noutlet, power line (electric power source), and all weather road are available. There should be provision for easy electricity connection. Outages are more likely if the site is far removed from the electric substation. You need to have access to very good roads to ease the supply process. Inadequate road and transportation facilities creates problem to produce and market fresh farm produces (e.g., milk, meat, fish and egg). \n\tDistance from residences: Odorsare inherent in livestock operations, especially when manure is not managed properly. Prevailing wind direction in relationship to non-owned residences is important. The site should not be near hospital, school, residential areas, slaughter houses, factories, etc."

There should be enough space between farm houses to reduce the possibility of disease spreads\n\tSize: The area for the farm should be of adequate size while considering future expansion. Plan for expansion some years into the future; consider doubling the size anticipated at present. Avoid locating facilities near property lines, public-use areas, or other features that limit expansion. \n7.3.2. Guidelines for Construction of Animal House \nA good housing system provides adequate space for feeding and exercise \nand proper ventilation. Housing should be constructed in such a way that it offers a maximum comfort and protection from environmental stresses. The objective is to provide housing which is inexpensive to build and economical to operate and maintain. The house should at the same time be easy to clean and disinfect to minimize animal mortality. It should protect farm animals from drafts. The system of ventilation should be adequate to prevent dampness. \nCareful planning of buildings is essential in developing an integrated \nand efficient layout for producing quality products such as milk. Due consideration must be given to building and equipment arrangements for efficient use of labor and feed (efficient communication). Inadequate and improper planning results in additional labour charges and increased costs in maintenance. The basic guidelines for construction of farm animal’s house are detailed below.\nOrientation: There are two types of orientation for animal houses. \nThe East-West direction helps to avoid direct sunlight. Feed and water \ntroughs could be placed under shade all times a day. In this orientation, \nfeed consumption will increase and more manure will be dropped in the shade. In North-South orientation, the sun will strike every part of floor area under and on either side of the roof at some time of the day. This will keep the floor area dry. If paving is too costly, this orientation is preferred to keep the area dry."

Foundation must be with \nstones but inner side must be smooth. Good sanitary control measures should be taken into account in the design of housing floor. An ideal floor for a livestock house is well drained and made of cement concrete. Flooring must facilitate hygienic feeding and effective removal of liquid and solid wastes. Floor should be made non-slippery so grooves and a roughened surface should be provided.\nWalls: The walls should protect farm animals from draft. It should be \nhard and durable preferably made with cement concrete. The inside of the \nwalls should have a smooth hard finish of cement, which will not allow any lodgment of dust and moisture. Avoid constructing any corners or projections on which animals could injure themselves. The walls of the house could also be made of any inexpensive local materials such as wood and bamboo. If wood is used, then the farmer should paint with wood preservative solution every 3 to 5 years. The walls may be solid or partially open depending on the local conditions and the type of animals. Side walls often include windows which can be covered with wire mesh for ventilation. This is especially true for chicken and pig houses. The width, which is shorter than the length side, has to be solid.\nRoof: A well designed roof is quite important in reducing heat and cold \nstresses. It should be preferably made with galvanized iron-sheet for \ndurability and comfort. Like the walls, the roof could also be made of any inexpensive local materials such as thatches. The roof needs to be high enough to release excess heat, moisture and pollutants. The roof should be sloped, overhang should be at least 60 cm to offer protection from sun and rain. Direct solar radiation increases the heat load on the animals. This in turn has an adverse effect on production and reproduction of the animals.\nVentilation: A is the entry and circulation of air freely. A smooth air \nmovement will supply the animal with fresh air for breathing and to remove noxious and toxic gases (e.g., CO2 and NH3) from the house. Adequate ventilation system is a must in all farm animal houses to avoid dampness.

Introduction to Animal Health and Disease Control\nThe best economic returns are realized when animals are kept in good \nhealth and disease problems are minimized. Health is the state of wellbeing of an animal. Any departure from the state of health is called disease. A healthy animal attains an acceptable level of production within the farming system in which it is maintained. Loss of appetite and weight, slow growth, reduction in production, reproduction loss and death of the animal are consequences of animal diseases. \n8.1.1. Routes of Transmission of Pathogens\nPathogens are disease-causing microorganisms. Animals can be infected \nwith pathogens through different ways. Direct contact with an infected animal or its tissues or fluids (e.g., blood, saliva, urine and droppings) is one of the ways. Ingestion of pathogens from contaminated feed, water and farm equipment (e.g., feed and water troughs) is another route of infection. Pathogens may be spread during mating or before birth through the placenta. Animals also can be infected through inhalation of droplets or dust containing pathogens or through vectors (living organisms, such as insects, carrying pathogens). \n8.1.2. Symptoms of Sick AnimalsA symptom is a sign or indication of the existence of a disease or other \ndisorder. Sick animals can show a wide variety of symptoms, depending on the disease. These include loss of appetite, weight loss, coughing, being unable to rise, slow movement, lameness, and isolation from the herd or flock. A sick animal may stand with its head and neck down, or appear to have a tired or lazy look. They may have watery, bad-smelling or blood-stained faeces and urine.

There may be variation in body temperature, pulse rate and respiration rate. Disease may also lead to death.\n8.2. Major Diseases of Farm Animals\nDiseases of farm animals are usually categorized as infectious and non-\ninfectious. The infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic organisms such as virus, bacteria and protozoa. They are communicable from one \nanimal to another animal or a human being. Examples are anthrax, foot and mouth disease (FMD) and Newcastle disease. Non-infectious diseases are neither caused by pathogens nor passed from one animal to another. Non-infectious diseases may be caused by hereditary factors or by the environment in which an animal lives. Examples are ketosis, rickets and poisoning.Form a group of 3-5 students, and visit the nearby veterinary clinic  \n Observe the common symptoms of sick animals and health problems of farm animals in the clinic.

The cause, host, transmission, symptoms and preventative/control measures for some diseases are described below .\nFoot and Mouth Disease (FMD): This is a highly contagious, acute viral \ndisease. It affects cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. Contact with infected urine, faeces, milk and nasal discharge are the main routes of transmission. This disease is characterized by formation of sores on feet, lips, tongue and cheek. Symptoms include fever, rough hair coat, salivation, foaming, inability to feed, weakness, lameness and death.

Birds may show signs of lack of appetite, respiratory difficulties, twisted neck, paralysis of the legs or wings, laying of soft shelled eggs, and watery greenish diarrhea. Culling of sick birds, quarantine and vaccination are recommended measures of prevention and control.\nTaeniasis: This disease is also known as tapeworm infection disease. It \naffects cattle and pigs.  Anaemia, vomiting and discomfort are symptoms of the infection. The common mode of transmission is through the soil during feeding. Regular de-worming and good sanitation are recommended control measures.\n8.3. Internal and External Parasites of Farm AnimalsA parasite is an organism that lives in or on another host organism to get \nits nourishment. Over 1,000 species of parasites affect domestic animals. Parasites can be broadly classified into internal and external, depending on where they live. Animal parasites cause loss of production and high mortality rate. This results in negative financial impacts on farmers. They may also cause or transmit diseases. Diseases that occur due to parasites are called parasitic diseases.\nInternal parasites\n (Endoparasites) live in the blood or tissues of the \nanimal’s body. Tape worm, round worm, trypanosome and liver fluke are \ngood examples of internal parasites. They often interfere with the animal’s digestion and assimilation of food. They share the animal’s food and cause diarrhea, anaemia and loss of condition. The consequence is often death, if there is no effective treatment. This leads to loss of production and income."

Both production loss and mortality are loss to a farmer . \nAnother effect of animal diseases and parasites is economic loss. These may arise in several forms. Reduction in productivity and mortality result in money loss. Farmer has less product to sell and/or has a reduced number of animals. External parasites attack the coat of animals. This degrades the market value of hide, skin and wool. Diseases and parasites limit the export of live animals and their products to other countries. Costs of control, prevention, diagnosis and treatment are also expensive. Consequently, \ndisease and parasite outbreaks also affect food and job security. Any of \nthese can results in an economic loss to the farmer as well as a nation.\nAn additional effect of animal diseases and parasites is the public health \nconcern.

Washing feed and water troughs well is one helpful measure. Separating sick animals from the healthy ones is another. Dead animals should be either burned or buried.  \n\tGood management: Animals that are provided with the essential \nnutrients can resist the effect of disease and parasite attacks. Keep \nanimals’ house well ventilated and dry. In pasture grazing, following \nrotational grazing and avoiding overcrowding is recommended.\n\tQuarantine and isolation: Purchase only healthy-looking animals \nfrom reputable farms. At arrival, quarantine the new animals, by keeping them away from the other animals for two weeks until you’re sure they aren’t sick. Isolate any sick animals to prevent illnesses from spreading. \n\tMedication:  This is one of the most important measures in controlling \nfarm animal diseases. Timely vaccination against diseases and quarantining diseased animals are important. The use of drugs in the form of powder, liquid or solids can be another option.\n\tSpraying or dipping: Spray animals with chemical solutions or dip them in the solutions. This controls external parasites like flies, lice, mites and ticks. Spraying pens and animals with veterinary chemicals helps to control external parasites. Dipping animals in water containing chemicals such as wettable powders is good for controlling ticks, mites and lice.

Indigenous Knowledge in Livestock Disease Treatment \nIn Ethiopia, plant-based remedies are the most important and sometimes \nthe only method of managing livestock diseases. It is an inexpensive alternative to science-based treatments. Farmers mostly acquire ethno-veterinary knowledge from their elders. Indigenous veterinary practices include mechanical, physical, pharmacological, surgical, rituals and managerial methods of treatment. Several medicinal plant species of veterinary importance are documented. Most medicinal plants are collected from the wild. The plant parts used for livestock health treatment may be leaf, root, rhizomes, bulb, bark, seed, stem, whole parts; alone or in combination. \nThe preparation methods of traditional medicine are concoction, squeezing, \ncrushing or pounding. Concoction (mixing things together) is the major form of preparation of herbal medicines. Farmers are aware of toxicity and provide antioxidants. They can determine the dose using different household utensils. Farmers can also use their own hand. Ethno-veterinary medicines are administered to livestock in different ways. Oral route is the most common mechanism of application of traditional medicines. \nA large number of livestock diseases and parasite syndromes are treated by \ntraditional practitioners. Anthrax, black leg, ectoparasites and endoparasites are good examples of livestock disease and parasite syndromes treated using traditional medicines. Rabies, foot and mouth disease, bloat, and colic are other examples of animal diseases treated in this way. Besides plant-based medications, some animal fluids are used in traditional medicine. For example, the Somali pastoralists in Ethiopia immunize their \nanimals against rinder-pest by employing a solution of urine, milk and \nfaeces obtained from the animal with mild cases of rinderpest."

Cattle of this type are \nexcellent in converting feeds into high quality milk. Some categories of cattle are raised for both meat and milk production. These are called dual-purpose cattle. Other cattle have the properties of a typical dual-purpose cattle (i.e., milk and meat production). These cattle also have some features of working cattle such as strong bones, sound constitution, and quiet temperament. These are called multi-purpose cattle. \nIn this unit, you will learn about the dairy cattle types. Dairying or dairy \ncattle production is a branch of agriculture that encompasses the raising of dairy animals for the production of milk and milk products. Milk is the primary product of dairying. Before producing milk, a cow must first have a calf. Female calves of modern breeds reach sexual maturity at the age of seven or eight months and are then called heifers (i.e., before having their first calf or having only one calf). Heifers are usually mated when they are 15 to 18 months old. This age is said to be the age at first service. The gestation period typically lasts 265 to 300 days. Heifers tend to give birth to their first calves at the age of 2 to 2.5 years. They are typically bred again four to eight weeks after calving. Good dairy farming practice involves the production of safe and high quality milk from healthy animals. This involves different management practices such as breeding, feeding, housing, health care and record keeping.Brainstorming 9.1. \nPair work\nIn pairs, discuss what you already know about dairy cattle production \nor dairying. \n*Share the summary of your discussion with other pairs of students \nsitting next to you."

Such characteristics \nare used to judge the production potential of the animals. One can judge desirable conformation by closely inspecting the animal in question. \nThe indicators of good productive dairy cattle include general appearance, \ndairy character, body capacity and mammary system. The high yielding dairy cows are usually not large, and are characterised by a lean, angular form and a well-developed mammary system. They should have wedge shaped body appearance (i.e., the front portion being less deep than the rear), bright eyes and a lean neck. The udder should be healthy and large enough to produce and store milk. All four quarters of the udder should be well demarcated with well-placed teats. The udder should be attached high to the abdomen to prevent teat injury."

Dairy cattle feeding \nmanagement is a very important farm management area for two reasons. First, nutrition plays a very important role in maintaining the health and productivity of dairy cattle. Second, feed alone constitutes 60 to 70% of the production cost of milk. This is why feeding management plays a vital role in farm economy. This management involves feeding a balanced diet and avoiding overfeeding. \nFeed is of two types: roughage and concentrates. Roughage available on \nthe farm includes grazing, hay, silage, and roots. Timothy, Clover and Alfalfa are the some kinds of green fodder to be given to dairy cattle. Concentrates are supplementary feeds and not a staple feed. Concentrates should contain high-energy feeds and protein supplements. The first four months of lactation will require a higher percentage of concentrates because production will be high during this time. Reducing concentrates for low-producing or cows in the late lactation period helps to reduce feed costs. In general, two-third of the daily dry matter requirement should be supplied from roughages. The remaining portion from concentrates.\nLactating dairy cows need energy, protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals and \nwater.

The higher producing cows will need more than 4% of their body weight as dry matter. For example, a high-producing (over 25 L/day) 450 kg cow needs 450 kg x 4% = 18 kg DM/day. Farmers can monitor the adequacy of daily dry matter intake of their lactating cows as presented in the following table.\nTable 9.2.

Lactation curve \nThe shape of the lactation curve will differ for each individual and also the breed of the animal. Feeding and management will also influence the shape of the lactation curve and have a significant impact on the total amount of milk produced. Peak yield is the point where the cow reaches the highest milk production level during the entire lactation. Normally the peak is reached four to ten weeks after calving. Milk yield remains high for a while and then gradually declines in the later stage of lactation.  \nThe dry period is the most important phase of a dairy cow’s lactation cycle.

Hygiene at all stages of milk collection and processing is very important. Milk can be transported in milk cans or bulk tankers from collection to a processing center. There are several reasons for milk processing. Basically milk is processed to increase shelf life and palatability of milk products. Processing reduces bulkiness (i.e., can reduce the space taken up by milk). This allows producers to access distant markets and satisfy consumer demands. It also creates employment opportunities. \nPasteurized milk\nPasteurized milk is dairy milk that is heated to a high temperature and \ncooled using a simple heating process to destroy any harmful bacteria and micro-organisms. This also extends the shelf life. Supermarket milk is always pasteurized. During pasteurization, milk is heated to between 63 and 65°C for 20 to 30 minutes or 72 to 75°C for 15 to 30 seconds. The simplest equipment required is an open boiling pan over a fire. Pasteurized milk has a shelf life of 2 to 3 days, and up to 12 days if kept at 4 °, depending on the environmental conditions.\nCream\nCream is a dairy product composed of the higher-butterfat. When milk is \nleft to stand for some time, the lighter fat globules rises to the top. This top layer of fat is called cream, whereas the remaining milk is known as skim milk. The whole fresh milk might be separated into cream and skim milk. Separation can be achieved using a manual or powered centrifuge separator. There are different types of cream, each with different fat concentrations. Single or light cream contains 18% milk fat whereas double or heavy cream normally contains 48% milk fat. Cream is a luxury item and may be used in coffee, as a filling in cakes, or as an ingredient in ice cream. Fermented cream can also be processed into butter and butter milk."

The acidity prevents the growth of micro-organisms, and the fermentation preserves the milk for a long time. Yogurt is the best-known fermented dairy product. Yoghurt is produced by adding a mixed culture of lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus \nthermophilus (in a ratio of 1:1). This is to convert lactose (i.e., milk sugar) to lactic acid. \nMilk is normally heated at 70 °C for 15 to 20 minutes, using an open \nboiling pan, or a steam jacketed pan. The milk is cooled to 30 to 40 °C and then the culture is added. The product is left at a temperature of 32 to 47 °C for approximately five hours for the fermentation process to be completed, and then immediately cooled to 4 °C.\nCheese Cheese is a concentrated form of milk-fat and milk-protein. Cheese can \nbe produced from whole milk, sour milk, skim milk and butter milk. The cheapest way is production from butter milk or skim milk. Cheese is produced with the objective to prolong the shelf life of product, reduce spoilage, reduce the load and increase palatability. Despite variations due to several factors, cheese has all milk contents, and basically is composed of concentrated milk fat, casein, salts, lactose, and to some extent, albumin. \nIn making cheese, milk is coagulated by direct acidification, by lactic acid \nproduced by bacteria, by adding rennet, or a combination of acidification and addition of rennet. After that, coagulant is heated at about 50 \noC for at \nleast 20 minutes. The solid left is referred to as cheese, while fluid left over is whey. Hard cheeses have most of the whey drained out and are pressed. Soft cheeses contain some of the whey and are not always pressed. Cheese can be stored for a long time at 5 to 10 \noC."

Dairy Cattle Housing Management\nDairy cattle may be successfully housed under a wide variety of conditions, \nranging from close confinement to having few restrictions except at milking time. However, two types of dairy houses are, in general, used commonly. These are the loose housing and the conventional barn (See Unit 7 for details). The type of housing depends on the climate, local tradition and availability of building supplies. Loose housing with milking parlor is ideal for tropical regions like Ethiopia.\nWhatever the type of housing, careful planning of buildings is essential in \ndeveloping an integrated and efficient layout for producing quality milk. Housing should be an appropriate size for cows. This will allow them to stand or lie down easily. Respiratory infections and injuries can also be greatly reduced by the provision of adequate housing. Buildings must provide proper ventilation to reduce the spread of disease. The air in the barn should always be fresh, pure and free of dust and dirt. Good drainage is essential. Floor should be of rough concrete finish with 1.5% slope towards drain. Floor should not be slippery.\nTable 9.3. \nThe floor and trough space requirement of dairy cattle\nType of animal Floor space per animal (m2)Trough length \nper animal (cm) Covered area Open area\nNone-pregnant \ncows6-9 24-30 51-61\nYoung stock 4.5-6 15-18 38-51\nPregnant cows 30-36.5 55-61 61-76\nBulls 36.5-42.5 61-76 61-76\nSanitation and manure management in dairy farmMaintaining good sanitation or good hygiene is a key element in maximizing \nquantity and quality of milk.

Ongoing pen sanitation is an absolute necessity in preventing many of the infections that can debilitate dairy herds, both for calves and cows. Sanitation routines in dairy farm include regular cleaning of floors, bedding, walls and feeding surfaces. Modern sanitation equipment, when used with properly diluted chemicals on a regular basis, is key in preventing infections such as mastitis, ringworm, mange, foot rot and enteric diseases (i.e., cause intestinal illness) such as E. coli and Salmonella. Similarly, the presence of flies and other insects in the farm area disturb the animals and \nalso spread deadly diseases such as bovine Babesiosis and Theileriosis to dairy cattle.\nManure is a valuable resource on the farm as a great source of nutrients for \ncrop production. It can help to improve soil health. Dairy cattle produce a lot of manure. Each day each cow (large breed) produces 20 to 30 kg faeces and 10 to14 kg urine plus shed effluent from washing down floors. When not managed properly, the manure problem is associated with a number of issues, such as the community concern about pollution (smell, as well as contamination of groundwater and water courses). This is because manure contain Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Carbon. \nThe most common method of manure management is storage in pit and \nspreading. A manure pit should be dug, large enough to hold the shed’s manure produced over 2 or 3 days. House floors should be designed for efficient drainage with wide channels for easy urine and faeces removal. A channel should be dug leading from the house floor to the pit and lined with concrete. This permits dairy farmers for manure collection, storage and application as a natural fertilizer for crops. This effective management of manure will allow farmers to grow their own feed for their cows. They spread manure over their forage fields before a crop is planted or practice composting to apply to their crops or sell to local nurseries. Manure can also be used for biogas production."

Definition and Importance of Natural Resources \nDefinition\nNatural resources are objects or materials, creatures or energy found in \nnature which can be used by humans. Hence, natural resources cannot be produced by humans, but they are used by humans. Natural resources are either renewable or non-renewable. Renewable resources are capable of regenerating themselves after use. Forests, soils, water, biodiversity, atmospheric air are examples. Non-renewable resources are resources that cannot regenerate themselves after being used once. Examples include oil, coal and minerals that occur in the natural environment. \nImportance \nNatural resources provide both direct and indirect benefits to humans. \nSome benefits are current benefits while others are only visible in the future. Most of our food and drink are directly or indirectly derived from natural resources. Natural resources are the sources of our clothes and shelters. Our survival, as a species, is dependent on the availability of \nnatural resources. Economic growth and development of a nation is highly \ndetermined by the magnitude and quality of the management of natural resources available in the country.      \n10.2.

Forests\nForests contain various plants or trees which stand very close to each \nother. In a forest, the leaves of tall trees form a continuous canopy. This significantly reduces the amount and quality of light that reaches the ground level and influences other climatic variables in the forest ecosystem. This in turn determines the number and types of different groups of plants, animals and microorganisms that live in the forest."

The evolution of man and forest\nImportance of Trees in the Environment\nTrees provide us with a wide range of products and services. These \ninclude firewood, fruits, medicines, timber and food. They are sources of construction materials. Trees provide us with shade and protect us from a strong wind. Trees also have aesthetic and spiritual value. They are also important habitats for various wild animals and are sources of various non-timber products including honey. Trees are also vital in improving soil fertility through their roots. They add organic matter to the soil through leaves falling on the soil. Trees also protect the soil from erosion and prevent flooding. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and water and produce oxygen through photosynthesis, keeping more carbon in their biomass and reducing its release to the atmosphere.\n10.2.2. SoilsSoil is a mixture of mineral and organic particles of varying sizes.  Soils \nare formed by the weathering processes that take place on the surface of rocks. The weathering process breaks the rocks into smaller particles called soil parent materials. Air and water enter rock cracks and result in the formation of chemical substances. Bacteria and plants then colonize these rock fragments, which gradually transform into soils. When plants die, the bacteria enhance their decay and improve the fertility of the soil. These processes gradually result in the formation of soils in the environment."

For example, typical mineral soils contain about 5% organic material, 45% minerals, 25% water and 25% air. This serves as a source of essential nutrients for plant growth. Soils also contain water and air in the spaces between particles known as pore spaces. Soils, particularly the top layer, support plant growth including food and forage crops. They provide water, oxygen and different nutrients required for plant growth. \nSoils serve as a habitat for millions of soil organisms including earth \nworms, bacteria, fungi and other microscopic organisms. Soils are a major storehouse of carbon. They reduce the release of carbon dioxide by storing carbon. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the air causes climate change. So, storage of carbon in soils contributes to minimize harmful effects of climate change. The nature of soils is one of the major factors that determine crop productivity in an area. Soil properties that affect crop yields include the soil’s nutrient content, organic matter content, and soil reaction (acidity, alkalinity). Also, depth of top soil, soluble salt accumulation (salinity) and diversity of soil organisms affect crop yields. Change in these soil properties over time can lead to either improvement or degradation of the soil. High crop yields can be obtained only if all our activities can markedly contribute to the improvement of soil properties. \n10.2.3. Water\nWater is required by all living organisms. Water covers 70% of the earth’s \ncrust. Of the total water available globally, approximately 97% is found in the oceans and seas. Of the remaining, approximately 2% is fresh water and 1% is found as frozen in  ice caps and glaciers .\nAny body of water aboveground including lakes, rivers, streams \nand ponds, is called surface water. Surface water is used for many \npurposes. Water is used in agriculture and industry. Fish and wild \nlife need water for survival. Water is used for electricity generation. \nSurface water is also used for recreational and domestic purposes.\nKey terms:\nIce caps: mass of ice that covers a large area\nGlaciers: a huge mass of ice that slowly moves over land"

Soil Degradation: Causes and Consequences\nSoil degradation: is a long term decrease in the productivity of soils. \nDegradation of soils reduces their capacity to support healthy crop growth.  There are three major forms of soil degradation. These are: water and wind erosion, chemical degradation including soil acidification, soil salinization and soil pollution by toxic chemicals and soil physical degradation which includes soil compaction. \nSoil erosion refers to the washing away of surface or top soils by the \nnatural physical forces of water and wind. Soil erosion is mainly caused by water in the highlands where average annual rainfall is high, and by wind in the lowlands where vegetation cover is low. Soil erosion is a natural process, but human activities accelerate it. These activities include: the removal of vegetation, high intensity of tillage, overgrazing, mining and construction activities. Soil erosion removes valuable top soil, which is the most productive part of soils for agriculture. The loss of this productive top soil results in lower yields as essential nutrients that plants require for growth are washed away, and increased production costs. Moreover, the eroded soils may end up in water bodies including lakes rivers and streams and may result in pollution of water. Soil erosion also increases sediment accumulation in dams which reduces power generation from hydro dams.\nSoil chemical degradation includes the loss of essential plant nutrients, soil \nacidification, soil salinization and soil fertility decline. The major causes of soil chemical degradation include human activities such as deforestation, agricultural mismanagement and industrial pollution. Soil acidification is a common form of chemical soil degradation in highland areas in Ethiopia, where average annual rainfall is high. It is caused by removal of basic nutrient ions such as potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium from top soils by water (called leaching) or in crop harvest and improper use of acid forming mineral fertilizers. These factors gradually make the soil pH value to decrease below a value of 7 and acidity develops. Acid soils are not suitable for plant growth or for activities of numerous soil organisms. For most crops, the most suitable soil pH is between 6.5 and 7.2. When pH values go below this range, it is not ideal for crop growth and is results in reduced agricultural productivity.

This results from the use of salt-rich irrigation and insufficient drainage. Soil salinization is common in lowland areas where the amount of annual rainfall is low. When salt-rich irrigation water is used in these areas, due to high temperature in these environments, evapotranspiration (evaporation and transpiration) is high. So, when the water evaporates, dissolved salts remain behind and accumulate in the soil surface and cause salinization of soils. As shown in figure 10.4, accumulated soluble salts are visible as a white thin layer on soil surfaces. When soluble salt accumulation is high in soils, water may move from plant roots back to the soil resulting in dehydration of plants causing yield decline or death of the plants. Soil salinization also restricts cropping options for farmers because only few crop species grow well in saline soils. Soil salinization problems are particularly common in the Ethiopian rift valley region.\nFigure 10.4.  Degradation of soil by excess accumulation of soluble salts \non the surface\nSoil physical degradation is the deterioration of the natural composition and \nstructure of the soil. It often results in compacted soils with poor structure, which means that the soil particles are so closely packed together. Soil physical degradation can be caused by erosion of soils by water and wind, intensive (repeated) tillage practices (both oxen and heavy agricultural machinery), overgrazing and loss of cultivated land due to urban expansion. In physically degraded soils, there will be reduced root growth, reduced water and air movement in soils, reduced uptake of nutrients from soils by plants and reduced microbial activities. Also, physical soil degradation causes reduced water storage capacity of the soil and can result in increased flooding. These factors result in reduced plant growth and hence reduced yields."

Water Pollution: Causes and Consequences  \nWater pollution refers to the presence of unacceptable levels of harmful \nsubstances or chemicals in water. Pollution spoils the quality of water. Water resources can be polluted in different ways. For example, industries use acid and alkaline chemicals in their industrial processes. Waste water produced in such industries, if not treated, pollutes water in the environment.If waste water is acidic, adding base will neutralize the acid and brings its pH value to around 7 before discharging it to the environment. Most rivers and lakes have pH values ranging from 6 to 8. If this natural range changes, aquatic organisms may not survive because these organisms have specific requirement of pH range. Water resources can also be polluted by organic wastes generated by living organisms. This includes wastes from human, animal, agriculture and food processing. If these organic wastes reach water bodies, they can kill aquatic animals like fish.\nPhosphorus and nitrogen used as fertilizers in crop production are inorganic \nsubstances. We use metals extensively in our daily lives. Kitchen tools, paints, fuels, etc., are made of metals. Metals can enter water bodies by erosion or other ways. If the concentration of metals in water is higher than acceptable levels, the water can be toxic to aquatic organisms. Water can also be polluted by toxic substances like chlorine. Chlorine is used in production of disinfectants. Disinfectants are chemicals used to kill harmful bacteria and viruses. These chemicals also kill useful organisms like fish.

Gases emitted from cars, chemicals from industries, dust, agriculture and construction activities pollute the air. Other causes include soot and smoke from biomass burning and pollen and spores from plants.  Pollen and spores from plants can be suspended in air and cause air pollution. Ozone is a gas that, when present in the atmosphere, can be toxic for plants and animals.\nWhen we breathe in polluted air, toxic substances can enter our body and \ncause serious health problems. Health problems caused by air pollution, including respiratory problems, heart diseases and lung cancer, reduce the quality of human life and life expectancy. Air pollution also harms livestock and plants by reducing their health and productivity.\n10.3.5. Environmental Impact of Mineral Exploitation\nMineral resources like gold, bronze, iron ore, aluminum, etc., contribute to \nthe growth of national economy in many countries. Mining provides raw materials for different types of industries, and hence, is vital for the growth of the industry sector. Despite the benefits, mineral exploitation also has the potential to cause serious environmental problems.\nDuring the mining process, surface excavation is often carried out to \nexpose the mineral material. Dust particles from the excavation process can pollute the air. After excavation, rocks are crushed to smaller sizes, and the minerals are separated. Leftover materials are disposed or dumped as wastes. These wastes pollute soils and water in the area. The separation processes usually use water and chemicals. The chemicals, especially heavy metals and naturally occurring radionuclides (radiation emitting elements like uranium), can pollute water resources. Air pollution from mining can result in serious human and animal health problems. Water and soil pollution from mineral exploitation can harm soil, aquatic organisms and humans when the polluted water is used for domestic uses."

Concepts of Natural Resource Use\nMany of the natural resources (particularly the non-renewable ones) that \nexist in different regions are available in only limited or finite quantities. For example, the amount of coal, natural gas or mineral ores that exist globally is finite. Failure to wisely use natural resources results in their depletion in a short time. Lessening the amount of natural resources available in our surrounding markedly affects the fate of future generation. A proper management of natural resources ensures its sustainability. The terminologies and concepts commonly used in natural resources management are described below.  \nCarrying capacity\nCarrying capacity refers to the maximum population level for which a \ngiven resource can satisfy the food and shelter requirement. For example, if a hectare of grassland can produce sufficient food for 100 sheep that is the carrying capacity of the grassland. Keeping 150 or more sheep on this grassland is far beyond the carrying capacity of the land. \nWhen population exceeds a given ecosystem’s carrying capacity, coupled \nwith starvation leading to the emergence of diseases and predators that will eventually reduce the population. Farming has increased the carrying capacity of the world by increasing the amount of food that can be produced on the land. Intensive crop and livestock  production has increased the \ncarrying capacity of the land. In the process, the capacity of resource to pass onto the next generation and provide services to fulfill human needs can be highly damaged. \nSustainable us e\nSustainable use: refers to natural resource use that creates and maintains a \ncondition in which humans use resources to fulfill their social, economic \nand other requirements.

Soil Management  \nThe way we manage the soils determines how exposed they are to soil \nerosion and other soil degradation processes. Soil erosion is a major soil degradation process. It reduces the productivity of soils. When soils are repeatedly cultivated, soil particles become pressed together. When soil particles are highly pressed together (compaction), rainwater does not enter the soil. Instead, a runoff which often causes soil erosion is created. When soils are bare, when they are without any crops, grasses or other types of vegetation, they can be easily washed away by rainwater or wind. Complete removal of plants during harvest or using fire during land preparation leaves the soil empty, without any cover and also causes nutrient depletion and a decline in soil fertility.\nThe magnitude of soil erosion effect on soil productivity is determined \nby how we manage our soils to reduce losses by soil erosion. Different management practices are used to reduce the effects of soil degradation on crop productivity.\nSoil management practices to control soil degradation\nAgronomic measures like mulching, mixed cropping and contour \ncultivation or strip cropping are usually soil management practices used in annual crops production. The objective in using these practices is to protect the exposure of soils to water or wind erosion - i.e., covering the soil by vegetation protects soil erosion. The vegetation cover does not have to be only living plants. Dry crop residues or various forms of mulch can also effectively protect soil from erosion. The plant cover or mulch absorbs the energy from raindrops and prevents loosening and removal of soil particles by erosion. Brainstorming  11.1. \nAnswer the following questions individually. \n1. What is soil management?\n2. Why is managing the soil important? \n3. Write some indigenous soil management practices used in your locality."

When rain directly drops on bare soil, it loosens the soil and causes the soil particles to be washed away easily. The mulch absorbs the energy of raindrops and run off water. This reduces the eroding capacity of the raindrops and run off water .\nWhen crops are grown in mixture, they provide better coverage for the soil. This reduces more soil erosion than does mono cropping. Maize is grown mixed with beans in many maize producing areas in Ethiopia. Growing beans mixed with maize protects the soil well. The maize canopy protects the soil against raindrops and the beans provide additional canopy coverage.\nContour cropping : refers to planting long lines of plots with different \ncrops along the contour to control soil erosion.

Including legume crops in cereal crop plantings, applying manure, compost or other organic fertilizers improve soil fertility. Adding inorganic fertilizers also increases soil fertility but, the increase in the crop types in a farm increases the amount of organic matter added to the soil. When organic matter content of soils is increased, soils have better resistance to soil erosion and structural deterioration. Therefore, an increase in organic matter content of soils increases the fertility level of the soils and improves plant growth and better plant growth means better canopy coverage for the soil, resulting in reduced soil erosion. \nLiming is the practice of adding calcium and magnesium-rich materials \nsuch as limestone to the soil in order to increase the pH value and reduce soil acidity. The calcium and magnesium added to the soil have the capacity to replace acidic nutrients from soils and increase the pH value (reduce soil acidity). When soil acidity is reduced, plants start to absorb essential nutrients from the soil and crop yield starts to increase, depending on the crop type. Traditionally, farmers in areas with acidic soil also add wood ash to the soil, which has the capacity to reduce soil acidity to some extent. In addition to addition of lime and wood ash to increase soil pH (reduce soil acidity), planting of acid tolerant crops is an alternative soil acidity management option. Such crops give reasonable yields in acidic soils and include crops such as rice, cowpea, cassava and mango.\nManagement of saline soils includes the removal of accumulated soluble \nsalts from surface soils by washing (leaching) with good quality water. Also, addition of organic fertilizers such as compost and animal manure can improve the physical properties of salt affected soils and hence their \nproductivity.

In developing \ncountries agriculture is mainly based on water received from rainfall. Water received from the rain can be lost in different ways. For example, evaporation, transpiration, runoff and deep percolation are ways rain \nwater can be lost. In areas where rainfall is the only source of water for growing plants, plants often face water shortage during critical growth stages. This problem is observed particularly in semi-arid areas. The total rainfall is low and rainfall patterns are unpredictable semi-arid areas. In such areas, it is important to reduce water loss through conserving water received from rainfall.\nDifferent water management practices are used in agriculture to improve \nwater availability for plant growth. One method is the use of contour cultivation in slopping areas. When soils in the slopping areas are cultivated opposite the slope, water running down the slope will be slowed down.

Excess water collected \nfrom roof tops of houses can be used for various purposes, including irrigation in droughts of short duration. This reduces carbon loss to the atmosphere and improves carbon stock and sequestration.\nFigure 11.3. Rain water harvesting in Eastern Ethiopia (taken from Tolossa \net al., Cogent Food & Agriculture (2020), 6: 1724354)\nReducing evaporative loss of water\nOne of the major ways water is lost from soils is through evaporation of \nwater. Water loss through evaporation is particularly high when soils are either bare, with no vegetation cover or when the coverage is low. Such losses can be reduced by spreading organic materials on the surface of the soils (mulching). Leaving some biomass standing during crop harvest can also reduce soil loss. \nSoil conservation\nPractices that are used to conserve agricultural soils also improve water \nconservation. These practices include contour farming, contour bunding, bench terrace on steep slopes and storing runoff water. For example, bench terrace in Konso (figure 11.4) is used to reduce flooding and soil erosion and contributes to soil conservation. These activities reduce the speed of runoff water. They allow the water to enter the soil. This reduces water loss and makes the water available for growing crops.\nIn dry areas, crops that tolerate drought can be used. There are crops that \ngive adequate yield with low water requirement and low transpiration."

What is Biodiversity?\nBiodiversity refers to the range of all forms of life on earth, including \nplants, animals, humans, bacteria and other organisms. It includes the different species, sub-species and communities that exist in a given habitat like a rainforest or grassland. Biodiversity has different components. Some are listed below:\n\tthe number of species (i.e., plants, animals and other organisms) or \n\tthe genetic diversity of different species found in an area, \n\tthe population of each species (plants, animals and other organisms), and\n\tthe diversity of habitats and landscapes of the species (forests, grasslands and others) in an area.\nThe biodiversity of an area shows how rich an area is in terms of the total number of species present and their populations and habitats. For example, Ethiopia is a country of high geographic and climatic diversity. This has resulted in high diversity of plant and animal species inhabiting the different agro ecologies. The country possesses a large number of plant and animal species that are not found elsewhere. These plants and animals are called endemic plants/animals. The way biodiversity of a given area is managed determines whether or not there is a healthy development of individual species and ecosystems.\n12.2.

The scales vary from specific sites or regions. Country or global level scales can also be considered. The scale of assessment of biodiversity depends on the objective of the evaluation. For example, if one needs to know the level of biodiversity of a forest area, or a water resource, they evaluate the biodiversity in that specific forest or water body. On the other hand, if the assessment of general national biodiversity status is desired, assessment has to be made at a country level. This constitutes assessment of biodiversity in all kinds of habitats and the different species of plants, animals and other organisms.\n12.3. Values and Services of Biodiversity  \nBiodiversity provides a large number of values and services for humans and the environment. For example, it provides products and services in:\n\t\nfood production (e.g., cropping, livestock, food from wild plants and animals)\n\t\nfirewood, fiber and construction materials from various plant species, \n\t\nmedicinal resources (e.g., various plant and animal species are important sources of medicines)\nRegulatory services\n\t\nclimate regulation - soil and forests store a large amount of carbon, preventing its release to the atmosphere, hence contributing to climate regulation\n\t\ndisease and pest control - some natural predators control some Brainstorming  12.2. \nAnswer the following questions.

This conversion is called land use change and is usually done to expand cultivated land for crop production. Land use change results in the loss of several plant and animal species.\nUnsustainable use of resources\nUnsustainable use of resources refers to overexploitation of resources \nincluding overgrazing, hunting and harvesting of biological resources. Overgrazing exposes soils to erosion, and this, can result in the loss of plant and animal species. Together with the species, ecosystem services can also be lost. Uncontrolled fishing, overuse of water resources and \noverharvesting of tree species are further examples of unsustainable \nresource use. Overharvesting of timber production has threatened the tree species Hagenia abyssinica in Ethiopia. Over pumping of water from lakes and wetlands results in the loss of species and habitats (e.g., Lake Haramaya disappeared for many years due to over exploitation, and only starting to come back as a result of restorative efforts).\nInvasive species\nSome invasive species compete against local species for resources \nand habitats. This causes loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus), the shrub Prosopis juliflora L. and water hyacinth (Eichornia crossipes L., ‘’Emboch’’) are good examples of invasive species that threaten biodiversity in Ethiopia. Parthenium weed invades forage and croplands. This causes yield \nlosses. Prosopis has invaded rangelands in the Awash Valley, in Afar and \nSomali regions. It has caused losses of forage species in the areas. Water hyacinth has become a major threat to the Awash river basin and Lake Tana. By establishing dense canopy, water hyacinth limits boat traffic and recreation, it shades native aquatic plant species, preventing their growth and negatively affecting aquatic animals that feed on these plants. It also reduces oxygen availability and can result in reduced fish production."

A substantial decrease has also been \nobserved in crop varieties that require long growing seasons.

Solid and liquid wastes often contain toxic substances. These toxic substances enter water resources, forests or soils. Water resources, forests or soils are habitats for various organisms. Their pollution by toxic substances can be highly harmful to living organisms in these habitats. \nThe pollution of habitats destroys the natural habitats of various species \nof plants, animals and other organisms. This in turn leads to the reduction \nin the number of species, and in the population of different organisms.

Definitions of Climate Change and Variability\nClimate change refers to a long term (e.g. decades) change in temperatures \nand the patterns of the weather. \nIn climate change, extreme weather events like unusual floods in some areas, \ndroughts that stay for long periods, wildfires, unusual snowfalls, intense hurricanes and warming of the earth can become more common. Climate variability refers to the short term (days, weeks or months) variability in the climate. Climate variability does not cause fundamental changes in the ecosystem. Organisms can adapt to the changes, as the changes in climate variability are not long-term. For example, some years can have below average rainfall while others have average or above the average rainfall.\nClimate change leads to fundamental changes in the ecosystem. Below are \nsome examples.\n\tA decrease in crop and animal productivity\n\tAnimals and plant species may be threatened and even become \nextinct\n\tChanges in water availability\n\tChanges in storm patters and frequencies\n\tIncreased flooding of coastal areas\n\tChanges in rainfall amount and patterns\n\tIncreased frequency of drought \n\tDrying of surface water resources\n\tIncreased soil erosion\n\tIncrease in desertification\nThe major cause of climate change is the production and release of \ngases called greenhouse gases to the atmosphere from different sources.

Climate \nchange causes an increase in global temperatures and the melting of icecaps and glaciers. Rise in the sea level and droughts that cause an increase in evaporation are consequences of climate change.\nEffects of climate change  on agriculture\nIn areas where agriculture is mainly dependent on rainfall, a decrease in \nrainfall, due to climate change, reduces water availability. An increase in temperature, due to climate change, also increases water losses from soils and surface water resources. In both cases, there will be water shortage for growing crops and for animals and human consumption.\nIn some areas, climate change can also cause increased rainfall. The \nincrease in rainfall may result in increased soil erosion. When soils are eroded, nutrients that plants use for growth will be washed away with the soils. This reduces nutrient availability for field crops and forages. The consequence will be a decrease in crop yields and animal productivity. Reduction in crop and livestock productivity is particularly harmful to societies that are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. Increased rainfall can also lead to damages of croplands and household properties.\nIn addition to reducing crop and livestock productivity, global warming \ncould increase the incidence of some crop and animal diseases. This results in the reduction of crop and livestock yields. Global warming and decreased water availability also cause a marked decrease in crop and livestock productivities. Climate change also affects animal production through reduced forage yields, heat stress from increased temperature, water shortage and increased incidence of existing and new diseases and parasites causing reduced animal growth and productivity.Brainstorming  13.2. \nDiscuss the following points in a group.\n1.

Therefore, crop and animal productivity is low compared to the potential. These characteristics of Ethiopian agriculture make it highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. For example, more than 90% of crop production in the country is rainfed, with very low production under irrigation. Climate change is expected to reduce rainwater and increase temperature. These will further reduce crop yields. Animal production will also be negatively affected by climate change. Therefore, a strategy is needed in agriculture to reduce climate change effects and improve agricultural production to meet the increasing demand for food production.\nEffects of climate change on forestry\nGlobal warming and reduced water availability causes reduced vegetation \ngrowth, reduced productivity and loss of some tree species. This reduces the capacity of the forest to absorb carbon through photosynthesis. Degradation of the environment in the form of deforestation, soil erosion and disappearance of wildlife enhances desertification in arid and semi-arid areas. Generally, climate change results in reduced capacity of the forest to regulate the climate through carbon storage. The forest is a habitat for various organisms - plants, animals and microbes.  Any loss of the forest or species in it causes loss of plant and animal biodiversity . \nEffects on sea level\nAn increase in global temperature – i.e., global warming - has already \ncaused melting of polar ice caps. This causes sea level to rise and coastal communities become more vulnerable to flooding. Flooding destroys communities and can damage the overall ecosystems."

The \npractice has been the largest source of human-induced carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere. Today, however, there is a growing need to shift to renewable energy sources like solar energy, wind energy and hydropower in order to reduce carbon emission.\nDeforestationClearing of forests results in the release of stored carbon into the \natmosphere. Forests are usually cleared to get additional agricultural land, firewood and timber. These practices release massive amounts of carbon to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. This contributes to global warming. The reduction of deforestation is an important way of reducing carbon emission from forests.\n13.3.2. Enhancing carbon sinks\nAfforestationForests store a large amount of carbon, through photosynthesis, in their \nbiomass, forest floor and in soils. Forests play a vital role by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This helps to mitigate climate changes. Afforestation means planting new forests and this enhances the carbon storage capacity (sink capacity) and helps to mitigate climate change.\n13.3.3. Improved soil management\nLike forests, soils also store a large amount of carbon. About 2 times more \ncarbon is stored in the soil, compared to the total amount in the atmosphere.

Climate Change Adaptation Strategies in Ethiopia\nClimate Change Adaptation\nClimate change adaptation refers to the adjustments that farmers and other \ncommunities make in response to actual or expected climate change. In order to cope with the impacts of climate change, farmers need to modify their ways of doing crop production and animal rearing. Farmers need to implement appropriate climate change adaptation practices to reduce the harmful effects of the changing climate. \nThe most common climate change adaptation practices include:\n Changing crop rotation and involving more drought adapted crops in \nthe cropping pattern\n Intercropping, mixing legumes and cereals reduces soil erosion and reduces water loss by evaporation\n Changing the crop type to crops that are better adapted to drought conditions, crops with lower water demand \n Changing the crop calendar with changes in the climate which means planting early or late following the onset of rainfall\n Using perennials like fruit crops mixed with legumes and cereals protects the soil from erosion and reduces water loss\n Using animal breeds which are better adapted to increased temperatures, water stress and possessing better feed conversion Brainstorming  13.4. \nAnswer the following questions in pairs.\n1.

Below are some of the common climate adaptation strategies used by farmers in Ethiopia.\nExpansion of perennial crops \nThis includes planting crops like enset and tree species that better tolerate \nthe effects of climate change. When field crops fail due to climate change, \nthe farmer may have food from enset plants or sell the tree products and \npurchase food. The use of these perennials reduces the risk of total yield loss. \nIncome diversification\nInstead of depending totally on agriculture, farmers participate in off farm \nactivities like trading, paid labor work and other activities. These reduce the chance of total income loss for the household, particularly during climate change.\nChange in crop varietiesCertain crop varieties are more adapted to moisture shortage conditions \nthan others. During moisture shortage years, farmers select crop varieties that are drought tolerant. These crop varieties can tolerate the drought conditions through short maturity period or efficient use of the available water. Through using these crop varieties, farmers reduce the risk of total yield loss.\nMixed cropping\nSometimes, more than one crop species is planted on the same farmland. \nThis helps to use the soil resource efficiently and, during climate change,"

In mixed cropping, crops have different \ntolerance to drought conditions. If one crop species fails to give yield, the other crop in the mixture provides some crop yield for the farmers.\nSelecting or breeding more suitable animals\nAn increased temperature and drought as a result of climate change would \nreduce animal productivity and will increase the susceptibility of animals to parasites and diseases. But the extent of the impacts depends on the animal breed. So, replacing low producing animals with fewer highly productive, disease resistant and breeds adapted to the local climate conditions and feeds is important to improve animal productivity in a changing climate.Improving management practices\nGlobally animal production is the major source of methane (CH4) \nemission which causes global warming. Improving the management of animal manure for example through using it for biogas production has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emission from the sector. Additionally, improving animal nutrition can reduce methane emission from the animal production sector. Implementing cut and carry system for animal feeding and limiting free grazing are also important strategies to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from animal production.\nFigure 13.3.

Definition of Basic Terms in Human Nutrition\nNutrition is the science of ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation \nand biosynthesis of nutrient in the body. \nFood is any nutritious substance that are culturally acceptable and people \neat and drink to maintain life and growth. \nDiet refers to the way people feed themselves and the foodstuffs they \nuse. It is concerned with the eating patterns of individuals or a group, and the sequence of meals in a day. People may eat twice, three or four times in a day. This is strongly influenced by people’s traditions and religion. People’s economic position, their place in the society and the possibilities offered by their natural surroundings are also important considerations in talking about diet.\nNutrients are chemical substances that are needed for us to live and grow.  \nThey provide us energy, repair of body tissues, support growth and aid the normal functioning of the body system. Some are required in large quantity, while others are needed in minute quantities.\nMacronutrients are needed in large amounts to maintain the body’s \nstructure and systems. Carbohydrates, fat and protein are macronutrients.\nMicronutrients are needed in small quantities for a healthy life. Minerals \nand vitamins are important examples. Micronutrients are used by the body to produce enzymes, hormones, and other substances essential for proper growth and development. \nHealthy eating means eating a variety of foods that give us all the essential \nnutrients we need to maintain our health, feel good, and have ener gy\n . \nA healthy diet provides sufficient nutrients, balance, and variety. Healthy diets contain different foods that provide the optimal functioning of the body. A variety of food is required to obtain all the essential nutrients we need in the body. \nBalanced diet is a diet that gives the body the right proportion of nutrients \nand calories needed to maintain healthy body. Balanced diet has the desired proportion of carbohydrates, proteins and micronutrients."

These are \n Carbohydrates\n Lipids (fats and oils)\n Proteins\n Vitamins\n Minerals \n Water \nMost nutrients have more than one function. The main functions are build \nand maintain body cells, regulate body functions and provide ener gy .\n Carbohydrate, fat/lipid and protein provide energy \n Protein for body building and repair\n Minerals and vitamins - regulate body function and defending force \nfor diseases\n Water for optimal hydration \n15.2.1. Carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates are sugars, starches or fibers that provide energy to all the \ncells and tissues in the body. One gram of carbohydrate generates four \nkilocalories of energy. Most of the calories in human diets are obtained \nfrom carbohydrates. Carbohydrates should constitute 45 to 65% of the daily calorie for optimal nutrition.

Usually “oil” \nrefers to liquid, and ‘fat’ to solid lipids at a room temperature. Lipids are a concentrated source of energy for the human body. A gram of fat/oil generates 9 kilocalories up on combustion. Fat should comprise 20 to 35% of the daily calories of energy. Digestion of dietary lipid products consists of smaller molecules called fatty acids and glycerol. Fat/oils make diet more palatable. Lipids also serve as energy storage and in structural functions. Stored fats serve as fuel reserves for the body by storing excess calories. Excess calories from carbohydrates, protein and lipids are stored in the form of fat in the body. The best fats are plant-based uncooked oils.\n15.2.3. Proteins\nProtein carries out a variety of functions. It ensure the growth and \ndevelopment of muscles, bones, hair, and skin. It also contributes to the formation of antibodies and hormones.  Protein serves as a fuel source for cells and tissues when needed. A gram of protein yields 4 kilocalories of energy. Proteins comprise 10 to 35% of the daily calorie for optimal nutrition. \nFoods such as red meat, eggs, dairy products and fish contain protein. \nBeans, legumes, soy, nuts and some grains are also good sources of protein. Protein is made up of organic compounds called amino acids. Proteins that contain all of the 20 amino acids required by the body are called complete proteins. Proteins from animal products, including eggs and milk, are complete. They can supply all the amino acids that the body can’t make on its own. Proteins from plant foods are incomplete, meaning that they do not contain all of the amino acids required by the body. However, incomplete proteins can still play an important part in providing protein in a healthy diet.\n15.2.4.

The fat soluble vitamins are vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and vitamin K. Water soluble vitamins are vitamin B and vitamin C. Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the body so do not need to be eaten every day and water-soluble vitamins are not stored so need to be eaten more frequently. Vegetables, fruits and meat are rich source all the vitamins. People with a restricted diet may need to take a vitamin supplement to avoid deficiency.\n15.2.5. Minerals The minerals are the second type of micronutrients. There are two groups \nof minerals: major and trace minerals. The body needs a balance of minerals from both groups for optimal health. Major or macro-minerals are elements with Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) greater than 150 mg/day. Examples are magnesium, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. Major minerals help the body to balance water levels, maintain healthy skin, hair, and nails and to improve bone health.\nTrace minerals are elements required in smaller amounts (microgram \nquantities). They usually play a catalytic role in enzymes. Some trace mineral elements (RDA < 150 mg/day) are iron, selenium, zinc, and manganese. Trace minerals help in strengthening bones, preventing tooth decay, and in reducing blood clotting. Trace minerals carry oxygen and support the immune system. \nSources of minerals include iodized table salt, nuts and seeds, vegetables, \nleafy greens, fruits, poultry, egg yolks, whole grains, and fortified bread and cereals.\n15.2.6. Water \nA person can only survive a few days without water. Slight dehydration \ncan cause headaches and impaired physical and mental functioning. The human body is made up of mostly water. Every cell requires water to function. Water helps several functions. Flushing toxins out, absorbing shock, transporting nutrients, preventing constipation, lubricating and rehydrating the body. The best thing to do related to water is to drink natural, unsweetened water from the tap or bottled sources."

The knowledge needed to care for and ensure a healthy and active life for all household members also falls under nutrition security . \nPillars of food and nutrition security\nThe four pillars of food/nutrition security are food availability, access, \nutilization and stability. \n\tAvailability is about having sufficient quantities of appropriate \nfood. It refers to the physical existence of food. At a household level, food can be obtained from own production or bought from the local markets.\n\tAccess refers to having adequate income or other resources to access \nfood.

The emergence of nutrition-sensitive agriculture in the past few decades is one of such developmental approaches. \nNutrition-sensitive agriculture is a food-based approach to agricultural \ndevelopment that prioritizes nutritionally rich foods, dietary diversity, and food fortification to overcome malnutrition. Agriculture is nutrition-sensitive when it goes beyond food production to address the underlying causes of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. This approach stresses the multiple benefits derived from enjoying a variety of foods, recognizing the nutritional value of food for good nutrition, and the importance and social significance of food and the agricultural sector for supporting livelihoods. The overall objective of nutrition-sensitive agriculture is to make the global food system better equipped to produce good nutritional outcomes.\n15.6. Malnutrition and Its Causes in Ethiopia\nMalnutrition is a condition that happens when your diet does not contain \nthe right amount of nutrients. There are two main types of malnutrition: lack of healthy foods in the diet (under-nutrition), or an excessive intake of unhealthy foods (over-nutrition), which can be reflected in several forms.\n\tObesity (being overweight): an indicator of excess nutrient intake \nrelative to the requirements. People are considered clinically overweight when their body weight more than 20% greater than recommended for the relevant height. Such people are at risk of several chronic illnesses, like diabetes, heart disease and various forms of cancer. \n\tStunting a chronic or recurrent under nutrition from poor diet, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Children are defined as stunted if their height-for-age is below the average for their age. This usually comes from insufficient food intake or frequent infections."

This \noften occurs because of a lack of access to food, infection or acute illness such as diarrhea. Severe wasting often lead to child mortality. Children are defined as wasted if their weight-for-height is less than negative two standard deviations (<-2 SD) according to the WHO child growth standard. Severe wasting often leads to child mortality .\n\tBeing underweight\n is an indicator of both acute and chronic \nundernutrition. Underweight children have low weight for their age. People are considered underweight when their body mass is 15% below what is considered the normal range for a person’s age and height. Children are defined to be underweight if their weight-for-age is below negative two standard deviations (<-2 SD) according to the WHO child growth standard. \n\tMicronutrient deficiency: a deficiency of one or more vitamins or \nminerals required for the body function, optimal health, growth, and development. This can occur when the body is unable to absorb the nutrients from food or if not enough food that contains a specific nutrient is consumed. The most important micronutrient deficiencies of global public health are iron deficiency (anemia), vitamin A deficiency (night blindness), and iodine deficiency (goiter), zinc (poor growth), calcium (weak bone), folic acid (neural tube defect).\nBody Mass Index\nBody Mass Index (BMI) measurements tells us if enough energy is being \nconsumed adequately. BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual. A normal BMI is when the weight of a person is appropriate for her/his height. For adults, simple BMI can be used as an indicator of nutritional status because most individuals over 18 years have completed their physical development. However, children and adolescents are still experiencing growth and development. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the age and sex of the adolescent when using BMI as an indicator of nutritional status."

Importance of Diversified Food Production \nAgriculture is an indispensable sector for food and nutrition security. \nAgricultural food diversification is the act of introducing or producing a variety of food from agricultural activities. It is important to produce and consume different types of food. Different food types provide different nutrients that people need to be healthy. Children need a variety of food to grow well and develop properly. Adults need a variety of food to have energy and be productive. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding need different foods for the baby and for themselves to be healthy and strong. \nDiversification of foods grown by a household can improve dietary diversity \nand nutrition outcomes. Different foods and food groups are good sources for various macro and micronutrients. This means a diverse diet is the best way of ensuring people have all the nutrients they need. Agricultural diversification or integrated farming systems involve several subsystems \nincluding crops, animals and fish. These synergistic interactions have a greater total effect than the sum of the individual effects on nutrition. It is recommended that an individual consume at least four food groups in each meal. A diverse diet most likely meets both known, and as yet, unknown needs for human health. Improved nutritional and health status can increase \nindividual productivity which leads to improved household production and \nincome.Brainstorming  16.1. \nIndividual work.\n1.

Dietary Diversification Strategies\nDietary diversity is defined as the number of different individual food \nitems or food groups consumed over a given period of time. Low dietary diversity is a particular problem in Ethiopia where the diet is frequently based on starchy staples such as teff, maize, sorghum, enset, and wheat. The diet often lacks animal source foods, (meat, fish, eggs and dairy products) and fruits and vegetables. Since the different food groups provide different benefits, consumption of diversified foods is important for the health of adults and proper growth and development of children.  \nStrategies for food and dietary diversification at the community and \nhousehold levels can maximize the availability of adequate amounts and greater variety of nutritious foods. Such activities include:\n\tpromotion of mixed cropping and integrated farming systems\n\tintroduction of new crops with high nutritional/health importance such as soybean \n\tencouraging the use of underexploited traditional foods and home"

Nutrient Enrichment Strategies\nDietary modifications are changes made to increase the bioavailability  \nof micronutrients in food at the commercial or household level. Changes \nmay occur during food preparation, processing, and consumption. Most modifications aim to reduce micronutrient deficiencies. One example of dietary modification is the simultaneous consumption of iron-rich foods with ascorbic acid (vitamin C).Group Work \nIn small groups, discuss the dietary diversification strategies \npracticed in your community.

The \nfour techniques of nutrient enrichment are described below.\n16.3.1. Fortification Food fortification is the practice of deliberately increasing the content of \nan essential micronutrient, i.e., vitamins, minerals, and trace elements in a food. It aims to improve the nutritional quality of the food supply and provide a public health benefit with minimal risk to health. It reduces the number of people with dietary deficiencies within a population. Diets that lack variety can be deficient in certain nutrients. Sometimes the staple foods of a region can lack particular nutrients. Addition of micronutrients to staples and condiments can prevent large scale deficiencies. \nThe FAO outlined that most common fortified foods are cereals and cereal-\nbased products, milk/milk products, fats and oils, tea and other beverages and infant formulas. Food fortification is a sound public health strategy because it is cost effective, can reach large segments of at-risk populations through existing food delivery systems without requiring major changes in existing consumption patterns.\n16.3.2. GerminationGermination of pulses and cereals is one of the traditional methods of \nfood processing. It is extensively used in the preparation of foods for weaning babies and for elderly people. Germination is a process in which a pulse or cereal will sprout small shoots when kept with small amount Key term:\nBioavailability  is the ability of a substance to be absorbed and used \nby the body."

The grains and pulses to be sprouted need to be soaked in just \nenough water so that all of it is absorbed. If the extra water in which they are soaked is thrown away, a lot of nutrients are lost.\nGrains like wheat, barley, sorghum, etc. can be sprouted. These grains \ncan then be dried in shade and roasted lightly. They can be ground and used in many dishes. Pulses are also sprouted first and then steamed and consumed. The time and water which each grain or pulse needs for soaking and sprouting is different. Normally, 8 to16 hours are needed for soaking and 12 to 24 hours for sprouting. The cloth in which the soaked grain or pulse is tied should be kept moist all the time. When sprouting is followed by fermentation, the vitamin content becomes much more improved.\nGermination helps to increase the digestibility of foods. Some carbohydrates \nand proteins are broken down into smaller and easily digestible forms. Grains and pulses become soft after sprouting, so they take less time for cooking and are easy to digest. This means germination increases the nutritive value of food with no additional cost. Some vitamins and minerals also increase when grains or pulses are germinated. For example, vitamin B becomes almost double in quantity while vitamin C increases almos t 10 \ntimes.\nInvestigating germination in grains/pulses\nMake a simple investigation to run-through germination of a \nrange of different grains/pulses such as bean or chickpeas or lentil. Several students can work together. Place a filter paper over the Petri dish. Scatter the grains/pulses over the paper. Then moisten or soak it with ample amount of water. Do these daily until it become sprouted. This investigation may take several days. Prepare a note on benefit of germination and present to your families and report back to the class.

There are different micro-organisms used, for example, yeast for bread and bacteria for yoghurt. The process involves the chemical breakdown of a substance by bacteria, yeasts, or other microorganisms, typically involving effervescence and the giving off of heat. The micro-organisms change nutrients already present in the foods into simpler and more easily digested forms and also make other new nutrients. Fermentation is what makes dough rise and become almost double in quantity. During fermentation the micro-organisms use up some of the nutrients present in the dough and change them into other better quality nutrients. They also make some new nutrients. Milk curd, bread and Injera are examples of \nfermented foods in Ethiopia.\nFermentation has several advantages. Fermentation improves the \ndigestibility of foods. The micro-organisms break the proteins and carbohydrates into smaller parts, which are easier to digest. During fermentation of cereals and foods (such as peas, chickpeas, beans, etc.), calcium, phosphorus, and iron are changed into better quality. These are then easily absorbed by the body. Fermented foods become spongy and soft. They are liked by children and adults.\n16.3.4. Roasting\nRoasting  is a cooking method that uses dry heat where hot air envelops \nthe food. Roasting can enhance flavor of the food. Roasting uses indirect, \ndiffused heat as in an oven. This is suitable for slower cooking of meat in a larger, whole piece. Meats and most root and bulb vegetables can be roasted. In roasting, the heat seals the outside part of the food and the juice inside the food cooks the food. Roasting is mainly used when cooking fleshy food like fish, meat or chicken. When heat is applied to the outer covering of the food, it seals it up thereby trapping all the juices inside the food."

Indigenous Knowledge in Nutrition Sensitive Agriculture \nIn Ethiopia, farmers are engaged in mixed crop/livestock farming \nsystems. They produce both plant- and animal-based foods for household consumption and for market. Organic vegetable and fruit production is becoming a common practice in most parts of the country. There are also area-specific traditional foods. For example, Chuko is common food in \nmost parts of Oromia regional state. It is made from barley flour mixed with concentrated butter. It is a very rich source of essential nutrients. Enset is utilized in its many forms (e.g., Kocho) mainly in Southern part of \nEthiopia. Such nutrient-rich traditional foods are luxurious and often used to complement staple foods or during ceremonies.\nThere are also different wild plants with the potential to contribute to \ndiversified food consumption, as well as both food and nutritional security. For example, wild plants like shoot of bamboo ( Oxytenanthera abyssinica \nL.), stinging nettle (Urtica simensis L.) and some wild mushroom species have been found to be rich in valuable minerals. These wild plants are dominantly found in north-western Ethiopia, central highlands and south-western Ethiopia. Moreover, these plants are consumed as food by local communities in the areas they are found. Domestication of these edible wild plants in appropriate agroecologies and their promotion for consumption can contribute towards improving food diversification of diet and nutritional security.Individual work\n1. Keep a diary to list all of the different foods that you eat within a week. Count the number of different foods. Do you think that your diet is sufficiently diverse? \n2. Visit a market in your area and find out if there are any new foods which you have not tried. Make a list of new foods you have seen which you could add to your diet to make it more diverse.\n*Share your finding and compare with others. Activity 16.3."
