Importance, problems and prospect of vegetable crops production \nin Ethiopia\nVegetables\nVegetables are plants whose fruit, seeds, roots, tubers, bulbs, stems, leaves, \nor flower parts are used as food.Vegetables are diverse in their growth cycles. Some are annuals. Others are biennials. Still others are perennials . \nVegetables constitute different types of plants including viny, shrubby, or tree in their growth habits. Vegetables are usually harvested fresh - when their moisture contents are high. This distinguishes them from field grain crops which are often harvested at mature stage. Vegetables are seasonal, perishable, and bulky in relation to their volume. They require intensive management. They are vulnerable to damage and cannot be stored for a long time.\n1.1.1 Importance\nThe most important vegetable crops in Ethiopia include: pepper, Ethiopian \nmustard/kale, onion, tomato, potato, chili, carrot, garlic and cabbage. Others such as green beans, asparagus, broccoli, celery and cucumbers are \nalso important. The major vegetables produced for domestic consumption \nare cabbages, tomatoes and garlic. Green beans and peas are mainly produced for export purposes. \nIn Ethiopia, vegetable crop production includes various important \neconomic activities. Many smallholder farmers and large-scale commercial producers are engaged in vegetable production. Brainstorming 1.1\nDiscuss the following questions in pairs in the classroom\n\tWhat are vegetables?

In addition, the country earns hundreds of millions of dollars every year from export of vegetables. Vegetables are mainly exported to the Middle East, to Europe and to the neighbouring countries like Djibouti and Somalia. Vegetables like tomato and chilli are among the major vegetables exported. This contributes to the national economy. \nSmallholder farmers choose to grow vegetables due to the relatively \nshorter growth cycle of the crops. Compared to cereals, vegetables have \na relatively higher value. Vegetable production has a higher potential to increase employment and household income. It is generally a profitable activity.\nProductivity of vegetables is often higher than that of cereal crops. \nCompared to cereal crops, vegetables are often intensively managed. Vegetables usually require special care after harvest. Vegetables are highly perishable and need to be stored and transported carefully in order to preserve their fresh quality.\nPublic awareness about nutritional and health benefits of vegetables has \nbeen increasing recently. Public health advocacy on the role of vegetables in human nutrition and health has significantly raised public awareness about the place of vegetables in health. \nAn increased consumption of vegetables reduces hidden hunger (i.e., \nmicronutrient deficiency) in children. Micronutrient deficiency is associated with the deficiency of essential vitamins and minerals. Vegetables such as spinach, tomato, etc. are often good sources of iron, zinc, and iodine.\nVegetables are rich sources of vitamin A, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), \nthiamine, niacin, folic acid and beta carotene.

Prolonged deficiency of Beta carotene leads to blindness. Leguminous and leafy vegetables are rich sources of proteins. \nAnother reason for an increasing demand for vegetables is the increasing \nprices of animal products like meat, milk and eggs. Vegetables are also raw materials for local processing industries. Local processing industries produce products like tomato paste and different juice types. Increased demand for vegetables has encouraged investment in the sector both by national and international commercial producers. \n1.1.2 Potentials and opportunities\nVegetable production has enormous potential to contribute to the national \neconomy and the livelihood of the farmers in the country. Ethiopia has\n\tfavourable climate for production of various vegetable crops, \n\tabundant labour, \n\tvast land and water resources \n\tsuitable regions for production of various types of vegetables \nEthiopia has diverse climate zones as indicated by altitudes ranging from 126 metres below sea level to 4620 metres above sea level. The altitude gives the country a wide range of climatic diversity. The climate varies from humid tropics to Alpine climates. These are suitable climates for vegetable production.  \nKey terms\nAgro ecology: relationships organisms have among themselves and \nwith the surrounding physical environment in agriculture. \nAlpine Climate: Climate of high mountain regions/highlands.\nHumid tropics: Regions with relatively high temperature throughout \nthe year and where rainfall exceeds evapotranspiration for 75% of the \nyear."

However, vegetable production yields per unit area, as well as the amount of land used for production of the crops, is increasing. This is because of:  \n\tan increase in public awareness about health benefits of vegetables, \n\tsmall scale irrigation\n\tthe government support for investors \n\tincentives in the form of tax exemptions and other related benefits\n\tlocal demand for vegetables\n\texport of vegetables\nIn addition, vegetable production and management is intensive.

These factors \nare climatic (temperature, light, precipitation, etc.) and soil which include the chemical, physical and nutritional status of the soil and topographic factors. Biotic factors affecting crop production include insects, diseases and weeds. 1.2.1 TemperatureTemperature is an important environmental variable that affects various processes during plant growth and development. Among the processes affected by temperature are photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, germination and flowering. Photosynthesis, respiration and transpiration increase with increasing temperature up to a certain point. Temperature also influences the shift from vegetative growth to reproductive growth stage. The effect of temperature on transition from vegetative to reproductive growth stages depends on the specific types of vegetable crops grown.\nTemperature determines the types of crops that grow successfully in a \ngiven location and their yield levels. Vegetables have their minimum, maximum and optimum temperature ranges. Crops that originate in temperate regions have lower temperature requirements. Crops originating in tropical regions require warmer temperatures.\nSoil temperature directly affects seed germination, root development and \nabsorption of nutrients and water by the roots. Warmer soil temperature generally increases the rates of these processes. The size, shape and quality of harvestable parts of vegetable crops are also affected by soil temperature. Tropical and sub-tropical vegetables may be damaged at temperatures below 10 0C. This is called chilling injury.Brainstorming 1.3\nDiscuss the following questions in groups of 2 or 3 students\n\tWhat environmental factors influence vegetable crops production?\n\tHow do the factors affect vegetable crops production?"

Also, for production of each kilogram of vegetable dry matter, about 322 litres of water is required. The following points demonstrate the roles of water in crop production:\n\tgermination and growth of crops start only when water is available\n\torganic and inorganic compounds absorbed by plants are dissolved in water\n\twater is required in the process of photosynthesis\n\twater is important in cell division, enlargement and turgidity\n\ttoo little or too much water is harmful for plant growth\n\twater shortage during critical growth stages directly affects yields\n\tinsufficient water supply during early plant growth stages results in the stunted growth of plants, and significantly reduces yield.\nIn addition, temporary shortage of water during critical growth stages (e.g., flowering, seed setting or germination) is damaging. For example, excess moisture from rainfall or irrigation can damage vegetable seedlings. It can also wash away plant nutrients from the soils. Excess moisture can erode soils and cause flooding. Floods can damage harvested vegetable crops and causes crop diseases and loss of yield.1.2.3 Light\nLight is the key element in photosynthesis. Plants grown in full light \ndevelop vigorously with high chlorophyll amount and high photosynthetic activity. Plants grown in reduced light have lower chlorophyll amounts \nKey term\nSucculent: a plant such as a cactus in which the leaves and stem \nare thick and can store a lot of water"

High \nlevels of atmospheric humidity is often associated with incidence of crop diseases and pests. \nHumidity affects plant growth and development through its effect on plant \ntranspiration from leaves. In humid atmosphere, the stomata open and allow diffusion of carbon dioxide, oxygen and water vapour. This allows active photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Very high humidity could cause increased germination of certain fungal species. This damages the plants. Excessive humidity could also close stomata which would mean overheating of plants as it limits evaporative cooling. Low humidity is also harmful for the plant. It may result in increased transpiration and this may attract some pest types. Green plants convert water absorbed through root and carbon dioxide absorbed through the leaf into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight through photosynthesis and produce oxygen (See Figure 1.1.)."

There are several types of vegetable production systems.\n1.4.1 Gathering of wild vegetables\nThis involves collection of edible parts from wild vegetable crops. Such \ncrops include shola, wild mango tree, leaves of moringa(shiferaw) tree, sama (Urticapilulifera ), water berry or ‘Dokma’, ‘Agam’ (Carissa edulis), \n‘Kega’ (wild Ethiopian rose) and others. Several weeds are also consumed as vegetables including Amaranthus.\n1.4.2 Vegetables grown mixed with cereal cropsEthiopian mustard grows mixed with maize crop. Taro and kale can grow \nmixed with coffee plants. Vegetables are most of the times is grown in places that cannot be used for growing cereals. The amount of vegetables grown in cereal fields is small.\n1.4.3 Home gardeningHome gardening is the practice of allocating land close to the homestead \nfor vegetable production. This system supplies much of the vegetable demand of the household. Home gardening can also be a source of income for the household. Various vegetables including fruit, seed, leafy and root vegetables are grown together. Such home gardens are very common in the Ethiopian smallholder farming systems. Household organic wastes can be used to fertilize the plots close to the house.  \n1.4.4 Commercial vegetable productionCommercial vegetable production is mainly market-oriented production \nthat is dependent on market demand. This is common around urban centres. It supplies vegetables for the urban population. Such systems are usually intensively managed with generous use of agricultural inputs. Fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation and machinery are examples of such inputs. Commercial vegetable production centres are often located close to urban areas. This makes transporting vegetable crops to the market easy."

This includes land use history, soil pollution issues, availability and quality of water resources, etc. Site selection should also consider possible effects of adjacent crop production.\nDuring site selection, the topography of the area should be taken into \naccount. Gentle slopes are suitable for vegetable production. Steepness of the slope accelerates soil erosion. Conservation practices like terraces can also be implemented before using the area for vegetable production.\n1.5.2 Sustainability management\nEnsuring the sustainability of a farm can be assisted by recording reliable \ninformation.

The quality of tubers, bulbs and tubers is usually checked before use.\n1.5.4 Integrated crop management\nCrop rotation could be practiced in annual vegetable production to improve \ndisease and pest control. Diverse crop rotations are effective in reducing pest/disease development. Over dependence on chemicals for crop pest and disease control should be avoided as much as possible. Planning of crop should consider previous crop protection practices used. Whether crop rotation is working or not could be checked by regularly recording information on:\n\tWhether yield is stable or increasing\n\tWhether pesticide use is decreasing or stable\n\tStable or increasing organic matter levels\n\tWhether soil nutrient levels are stable\nChopping and incorporating of crop residues or organic fertilizer, like compost, could be used to improve the fertility status of the soil. This also improves nutrient and water storage capacities of the soil. During integrated crop management, a balanced nutrient supply for the crop is needed. A balanced supply produces quality vegetable crop with minimal nutrient losses. \nIn planning fertilizer application, it is necessary to consider nutrients \ncoming from organic matter decay.

Soil \nmoisture conservation practices should also be implemented to increase availability of water in dry areas. Irrigation with groundwater should be started only after assessment of the groundwater resources. If irrigation is used, the amount and timing should be in accordance with the crop requirement. The quality of irrigation water is very important and should be monitored closely. Besides, fertilizers should be stored in dry and clean location. This avoids water contamination in the vegetable production area.  \nProfitability of Vegetable crop production \nMarketing is one of the most important factors that determine the success \nof any crop production including vegetable. Marketing starts with the de-cisions made by producers including choosing the crop types and their varieties to be produced and deciding how the produces are delivered to the consumers with acceptable profits. Marketing does not begin after the crops have been produced, rather before their production. Different mar -\nketing alternatives need to be considered before the production of vegeta -\nble crops.\nVegetable crops can be grown as sole crop or mixed cropping system \n.Whatever the cropping system is used, the economics of their production should take care of. In this regard, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and labor to perform different field operations including cultivation, management, harvesting, postharvest handling, marketing and etc. should be taken in to account during the production of a particular commodity. Pricing of a particular commodity should therefore balance the establishment of the market share of the produce and earning of an acceptable return. In this re-gard, the present chapter will make the students familiar with various steps involved in the calculation of cost of production and marketing of various vegetable crops so as to make the vegetable production successful."

Fruit production \nhas a vital role to play in the farmers’ livelihood. The activity can contribute to the food and nutritional security of the producing communities. Fruit production is automatically profitable and good for the environment.\nFruit production enhances natural resource conservation and maintenance. \nThe activity is also vital in diversifying the national economy. Fruit crops production is the basis for establishing agro processing industries. Agro processing industries markedly reduce unemployment. There is an increasing public awareness about the nutritional and health benefits of fruits in Ethiopia today. This has resulted in an increase in the market demand. Major fruit crops produced in the country include pineapples, passion fruits, bananas, avocados and, mangoes. Similarly, citrus fruits, mandarin, papaya, guava and grapes are among the major fruit crops in the country.\n2.2.2. Problems of Fruit crops production in Ethiopia\nFruit production is relatively new to Ethiopian agricultural system. The \nintroduction of a commercial fruit production were introduced in the late 1960s and the early 1970s (Godfrey-Sam-Aggery and Bereke Tsehai, 1987). Most indigenous fruits are wild. Most fruits produced in the household gardens and on commercial farms are recent introductions into the country. Their management is also new to producers, merchants and consumers. \nFruit production and utilization have many technical, economic and social \nproblems that must be identified and tackled to make the industry viable and sustainable. This needs the effort of producers, processors, merchants and researchers. Very few small-scale commercial farms produce fruits primarily for local consumption.\nSome farmers produce fruits for local markets, particularly in the areas \nmost suitable for fruit production. About four decades ago, fruits used to be sold only at hospital gates even in Addis Ababa. Over the last few years, however, some changes have been observed in the production, marketing and consumption of fruits in Ethiopia. This has given rise to an encouraging increase in the number of fruit shops in big cities.\nFruit production is very low in the Ethiopian highlands. In such places,"

Children in places like this collect and \nconsume indigenous fruits such as ‘Agam’, ‘Kega’, ‘Shola’ and ‘Koshim’. \nSuccess in modern fruit production depends on knowledge, skill and \ntechnical competences of the producers. Technical knowledge in proper production, management and storage is lacking among most small scale producers. This limits productivity of the fruit sector.\n2.2.3. Prospects of fruit crop production in Ethiopia\nIn recent years, the nutritional benefits of fruits have been recognized. \nThis has fairly increased the demand for fruit consumption. Ethiopia has diverse agro-ecologies, ample water resources and cheap labor. These can enhance fruit production in the country. Also, Ethiopia is located close to the Middle East and European markets. The government has introduced and implemented attractive policies to enhance the contribution of the fruit production sector to the overall economy. Given all these, the sector has a huge potential to improving the livelihood of fruit-producing communities. If fully exploited with proper production and management systems, the sector has a promising potential to markedly support the national economy.\n2.3 Classification of fruit cropsFruits are classified into groups based on certain criteria. They can be \nclassified on the basis of structure, temperature requirement, and plant characteristic, ripening response or response to ethylene.\n2.3.1 Classification based on structure\nAll fruits may be classified into three major groups on the basis of the number of ovaries and flowers involved in their formation. Simple fruit, aggregate fruit, and multiple fruit are the classifications.\nSimple FruitsSimple fruits develop from a single mature ovary in a single flower. \nExamples: apple, grape and citrus fruits.

The \nplants created through asexual propagation and bear fruit upon receiving \nthe external signal that induces flower development and will not have a juvenile phase unlike a plant from seed.\nWhile saving seeds is a great practice, certain plants and trees are better \npropagated via cuttings. This is particularly the case with many fruit trees that cannot produce the same quality of fruit as their parent plant. People can   get young sapling fruit trees from a nursery. Getting saplings from a nursery can be very costly; propagating from cuttings is inexpensive and easy. \nPeople often expect that the apple trees they plant are going to supply a \ntasty fruit such as what they get from the apple trees in their backyard. In this case, cuttings, but not seeds - provide them with a replication of the apples they get from the parent tree. This implies the need for asexual propagation of the apples by cuttings. \nCuttings \nPlants can be propagated by using cuttings in which apportion of a stem, \nroot, or leaf is cut from the parent plant, placed under certain favorable environmental conditions and induced to form roots and shoots. This produces a new, independent plant which is identical to the parent plant. The stem cutting can be divided into three groups, according to the nature of the wood used: hardwood, semi-hardwood, and softwood cutting.

The cuttings should be removed \nwith a very sharp, clean knife from a branch of the tree. They should be at least 15cm long but not longer than 30cm. Leaves should be removed from the bottom half of the cutting. Any fruit or buds should also be taken off. The cut end of the cutting should then be dipped in a rooting hormone and put in a moist rooting medium. \nAir layering\nAir layering is an asexual plant propagation method. In air layering a \nportion of plant is forced to produce adventitious roots without detaching it from the parent plant. It is usually used in plant species that are particularly \ndifficult to root. For example plants such as camellia, azalea, rhododendron, \nholly, etc. Air layering the intact stems allow a continuous supply of water, nutrients and plant hormones to the place of root development. Once the adventitious roots are developed, the plant is detached from the parent plant and starts to grow as an independent plant. This method is similar to propagation by cutting except that it is only detached from the parent plant after developing its own root system. When the roots are well formed, the air-layered branches are cut from the tree and either planted direct in the field or first planted in a container of soil and later set in the field.\nFigure 2.4.

The part of the plant that becomes the upper portion or top of the new plant (canopy) is called the scion. The part which becomes the lower portion that includes the root system is called the stock or root stock. All methods of joining plants are called grafting. Several grafting methods are used but, cleft or wedge grafting is the most common field level practice. Cleft or wedge grafting has a good chance of success. The stock and the scion must be compatible, or they will not unite. Grafting should involve only closely related species or plant families.

The purpose of a nursery is to provide young plants with suitable conditions for germination and subsequent growth. The nursery plants stay in the nursery until they are ready and strong enough for planting in the main field. Young seedlings of tropical fruits need special care during early growth stages. For example, they need protection from severe heat from the sun. Heavy rain, drought, pests and diseases damage seedlings. The selection of a proper site is as important as the planting system. Planting distance is also a matter to be carefully considered.

Establishment of \nan orchard requires planning. It takes a long time to establish good orchard. One of the most important considerations is the availability of resources. Site selection is the most important decisions that determine the success of a planting of fruit trees or orchard. Production site affects various aspects of the yield, its quality and marketability.  Good fruit production sites provide maximum fruit trees per hectare. Land preparation, preparing holes and planting of the fruits are important practices in orchard establishment and management. Seedlings have to be carefully planted into the prepared holes. This requires care not to break or bend the tap roots. The fertility status of the land is needed to be considered in the use of fertilizers on the site.\nPlanting and planting distance\nPlanting distance (spacing) is mainly determined by the type of fruit crop \nto be grown. Fruits can grow to big trees like mango or relatively small plants like banana and papaya. In addition to crop species, varieties could also determine fruit growth pattern and the spacing during planting. For example, the canopy of some fruit varieties could be narrow or wide.  For fruit trees of wide canopies, a wide spacing is needed. Sexually propagated plants are usually larger than vegetative propagated ones and that affects spacing.\nSoil quality and amount of rainfall in non-irrigated areas can also determine \ntree growth and size.

The modified roots \nconsist of the tuberous and fleshy roots. A tuberous root is a thickened secondary root as seen in Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and cassava (Manihot esculenta). A fleshy root is usually an enlarged primary root, as in carrot (Daucus carota), and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). Roots and tubers yield starchy roots, tubers, rhizomes, corms and stems. Roots and tuber crops are important cultivated staple energy sources, second to cereals, generally in tropical regions in the world. They include potatoes, cassava, sweet potatoes, yams, enset, and some aroids. These belonging to different botanical families but are grouped together as all types produce underground food. \nRoot and tuber crops produce large quantities of energy, in comparison \nwith cereals. They play an increasingly important roles in global food and energy security. The major root and tuber crops (potato, sweet potato, cassava, and yam) occupy approximately 53.93 million hectares worldwide and produce 736.747 million tons annually. Among the root and tuber crops, enset (Ensete verticosum), cassava (Manihot esculenta), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), potato (Solanum tuberosum) and yam (Dioscorea spp.) are the most important staple food crops in Africa which cover around 23 million hectares with annual production of more than 240 million tons.

The two most common ones are propagation by seed (sexual) and vegetative propagation (asexual). \nPropagation by seed starts with careful selection of seed trees. Propagation \nby seed uses ripe cherries. The first criterion for selection is the year of planting of the mother tree. \nSteps in Propagation of coffee by seed \nI. Seed tree selection\nThe first step in selection is at least 1 year before starting the actual \npropagation. After the harvest, select trees that look healthy and vigorous. Mark the tree, write down the position of the tree, and locate trees marked the first time and check if they are performing well. Select the final number of trees that you intend to use and remove the markers off the others that were discarded.\nII.

First, the freshly harvested cherries are passed through a pulping machine to separate the skin and pulp from the bean.  Then the beans are separated by weight as they pass through water channels. The lighter beans float to the top, while the heavier ripe beans sink to the bottom. Depending on a combination of factors such as the condition of the beans, the climate and the altitude, they will remain in these tanks for anywhere between12 - 48 hours.

Benefits of tissue culture\nPlant tissue culture is one of the \nmost rapidly growing areas of plant biotechnology. Plant tissue culture has a high potential to \ndevelop improved crops and ornamental plants. It has several advantages. These include:\nI. rapid multiplication of genetically uniform plants (clones) that possess desirable traits. \nII.  the production of multiples of plants in the absence of seeds or \nnecessary pollinators to produce seeds. \nIII.  the regeneration of whole plants from plant cells that have been \ngenetically modified. \nIV .  the production of plants in sterile containers that allow them to be \nmoved with greatly reduced chances of transmitting diseases, pests and pathogens. \nV. the production of plants from seeds that otherwise have very low chances of germinating and growing, e.g. orchids and nepenthes.\nVI.  obtaining plant that is free of viral and other infections. This \n‘cleaned stock’ can be quickly multiplied and used in horticulture and agriculture.\n5.4. Introduction to genetic engineering\nA genetic modification, sometimes called genetic engineering, refers to \nthe methods used to change the pattern in genetic material or information in a plant, animal or human being in order to produce some desirable trait. The genetic material found inside cells in molecules called DNA, is the “blueprint” for any living thing.

Achieving \nspecies resistant to pests and disease and species that are of greater \nfood security is another benefit of genetic engineering in agriculture. \nAchievement of species that have medical benefits to the world’s growing \npopulation is yet another benefit of genetic engineering in agriculture.\nRecombinant DNA and transformation techniques allow plant breeders \nto use genes from essentially any source as tools for crop improvement. \nFor example, scientists used genes from daffodils, pea, a bacterium and a \nvirus to enable rice grains to accumulate and create the so-called “Golden \nRice,” Beta-carotene is converted into vitamin A when consumed by \nanimals.

Beef Cattle Feeds\nThere are various feed resources used for beef cattle. These feed resources \nare commonly grouped into three forms as shown below.\nDry feeds: This type of feed resources includes hays, grains, oilseed \nmeals, straw, stover, corn cobs, corn husks, soybean hulls, soybean mill feeds, cottonseed hulls, peanut hulls, oat hulls, rice hulls\nGreen feeds: This feed resource includes pasture and green chop. (Feeds \nare roughages daily chopped in the feed and brought to livestock for feeding).\nHigh moisture feeds: Feed resources like high-moisture grain, haylage, \nwet byproduct feeds, roots and tubers, fresh milk, silage, cactus, Enset, etc.The availability of feed resources highly related with agroecology, season, \nlocation, the level of fattening farm, and land availability. Farmers or livestock owners use the resources based on their estimated nutritional values, their experience and the animals’ physiological status. Natural pasture, crop residue from maize stover and teff straw, stalker and improved cultivated forage crops, and maize grain are the main feed resources for cattle fattening in Ethiopia. Commercial cattle fatteners prefer noug seed cake, cotton seed cake and faba or lentil bean bran as protein sources. Commercial cattle fatteners choose wheat bran, ground sorghum and maize as energy sources. In the commercial feedlot, operators use confined feeding system. In the feedlot operation, beef cattle should be offered roughage first. Following roughage, the beef cattle are offered concentrate feeds. This happens twice a day depending on their requirements.\n6.2.2. Beef Cattle Feeding MethodsBeef cattle require nutrients to support manintainance , reprodicution, \nlactation, and growth. From these components, requirements for energy, protein, minerals, and vitamins are calculated for animals.

By understanding the different factors that affect requirements, producers can make adjustments to changes such as cold weather, moving to a hilly pastures, or the last third of pregnancy period.\n Age and Weight: The aged  or  the larger the animal, the greater its maintenance requirement, mainly energy, and protein. \n Breed: Extremely heavy-muscled breeds will have greater maintenance requirements than light-muscled breeds.\n Level of production: Heavy milking breeds have an increased nutritional requirement. Nutrient requirements for lactation are based on the amount of milk at peak lactation and the composition of the milk. Animals that produce more milk, and milk with more fat and protein, will have higher nutrient requirements.\n  Activity: Increased activity or rough land will increase maintenance energy needs as will extremely cold, hot, wet, or muddy conditions.\n Environment conditions: high environmental temperatures and weather conditions can impact feed intake. As temperatures increase above the animal’s thermal neutral zone, the point at which heat stress begins, dry matter intake decreases. \n Physiological status: Pregnancy and lactation increase basal metabolism, so maintenance requirements are altered accordingly. Adjustments to requirements for reproduction are based on expected birth weight and stage of gestation."

Meat production \nIn Ethiopia, a significant proportion of beef comes from old oxen kept \nfor draft purposes, culled cows, and surplus young bulls. In most farms, \nbeef production is not a primary objective. Meat production per head of \nlivestock is low by the standards of other significant livestock-producing \nAfrican countries. The estimated average live weight of cattle is 250 kg \nwith 14% offtake rates and carcass weight is 110 kg with 44% dressing \npercentage due to many-sided challenges related to production, husbandry, \nand marketing (AGPLMD, 2013). Ethiopian meat production over time \nis rising moderately with some fluctuation. The total meat production \nincreased from 578,240 tons in 2004 to 749,430 tons in 2010. However, a \nconsiderable decrease in production was witnessed in 2017. In 2017, about \n597,765 tons of meat were produced. \nDespite the huge size of the livestock population in the country, there is \nstill a shortage of production of meat in the country. Ethiopia contributes \nonly about 0.2 percent of the world’s total meat production. This is due to \nlow off-take rates, the inability to fulfill international standards, and the \npresence of legal and illegal live animal export in the country. The country \nproduces about 1 million tons of beef per year valued at USD 5.1 billion \n(ASL, 2018). The annual contribution of ruminants to meat production in \nEthiopia is estimated to be over 3.2 million tonnes representing over 72 \n% of the total meat production, from which beef accounted for over 70 % \nof the total red meat production. The volume of meat and meat products \nexported from Ethiopia is given in Figure 6.9 which covers between the \nyear 2013/14 to the 2nd quarter of 2017/18 (4428.5 metric tons).\nEthiopia’s average per capita meat consumption is approximately 8 kg, \nwhich is low, compared to averages in developing countries (25 kg) and \ndeveloped countries (77 kg). This is because of low per capita incomes. \nNon-commercial oriented animal husbandry practices in the country are \nanother cause of low meat consumption in the country. A similar other \ncause for low domestic consumption of meat is the increase in the price of \nmeat."

Microorganisms need certain amounts of free water for growth, and their growth is halted without a minimum level of moisture. Drying may be done to dehydrate fresh meat for extension of storage. Drying may also be one of the various processing steps during the manufacture of specific meat products. The manufacture of fermented meat products, such as dry sausages, or “quanta”, is an example, where drying is one of the processing components amongst several others."

All cause significant production losses. Widespread epidemics are controlled through prevention measures and nationally organized campaigns in the face of outbreaks. Production losses resulting from disease outbreaks are still significant but are lower than those caused by poor nutrition and internal parasites.\nContagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP): CCPP is a per-acute, \nacute, or chronic contagious disease of goats. It affects the respiratory system. Infection occurs through direct contact between goats. The disease is widely distributed in the Rift Valley and lowland parts of the country.\nMaedi-visna: The occurrence of Maedi-visna in Ethiopia was reported \nin imported sheep in 1986 at Agarfa, Bale. It was also reported in eastern \nAmhara. Lambs are infected by drinking infected colostrum or milk during nursing. Adult animals become infected when they come in contact with nasal discharges of the infected animals. The disease principally attacks sheep but has also been observed in goats.\nMaedi-visna: The occurrence of Maedi-visna in Ethiopia was reported \nin imported sheep in 1986 at Agarfa, Bale.

Animals become sick with RVF 1-5 days after infection. Animals are infected when bitten by infected mosquitoes. The disease only occurs every few years and usually after a very wet period when mosquitoes hatch from infected eggs lying dormant in dry mud. The occurrence of this disease interrupts export market of live sheep and goats."

Parasites Common among Sheep and Goats\nExternal parasites\nThe common external parasites for sheep and goats are: Ticks, lice, sheep \nked, mites, Psoropticovis- the sheep scab mite, Sarcopticovis, flies.\nExternal parasites are responsible for a great diversity of animal health \nproblems.\nInternal parasites \nThe major types of internal parasites of sheep and goats can be categorized \ninto four groups according to their location in the animal.  \n Abomasal worms - nematodes (round worms) \n Liver flukes - trematodes (leaf-like worms) \n Intestinal worms -cestodes (tape worms)\n Protozoa (coccidia)\nInternal parasites are mainly controlled using anthelmintic drugs.

Drenching and spraying: The build-up of parasites is likely to occur where sheep and goats are kept in intensive conditions. Spraying or dipping of animals is needed to reduce external parasites during periods of high infestation.\n7.5. Sheep and Goat Meat and Milk Production and Processing \n7.5.1. Meat Production and Processing \nMeat is the most important product of small ruminants in tropical countries. \nSmall ruminant meat is often used for celebrations. Therefore, the value of a live goat/sheep is often higher than the separate parts. Goat meat has a dark color and is coarse in texture. A characteristic of the species is that fat is deposited on the viscera and the male goats cause a strong smell on the meat. Fat deposition is sparse and yellow in color. There is a limited number of studies on goat meat efficiency. Efficiency is normally expressed as the amount of product/amount of feed input x 100. For energy in goats, this is 4.7% , and for protein 9.1%. This should not be confused with feed conversion efficiency, which is expressed as the amount of feed necessary per kg product. Criteria to take into consideration for meat production are growth rate, total number of goats and efficiency of production. Looking at the quality of meat, the quantity and distribution of fat is very important. The growth rate of lambs is normally in the range of 20-200 g/day. Male lambs grow faster than Female lambs, whether or not the diet is restricted. Ewe lambs get fatter than ram lambs on a given diet and castration reduces growth rate and increases fatness.group work\nField visit to nearby veterinary laboratory or agricultural office \nwith animal health department.

The mechanical techniques include penetrative and non‐penetrative captive bolt stunning and using percussive blows to the head and firearms with free projectiles. Electrical methods include head‐only and head‐to‐body stunning.\nThe slaughtering of sheep and goats for human consumption can take \nplace in a slaughterhouse, on farm, or at home. Sheep and goats are often slaughtered at home for consumption at family gatherings, ceremonial meals, or religious celebrations. Safe food handling practices must be used during home slaughter and processing to ensure the meat is free from disease-causing organisms and contamination. Since the sheep and goat meat processing procedures are very similar, the general sanitation procedures are summarised below:\n start with a clean animal; it is also best if the animal has been held off feed overnight. A full belly makes the skinning and especially the evisceration process difficult.

Meat can be wrapped and frozen at less than 0 °C for longer periods of storage. Promote food safety by always keeping hot foods hot (above 63°C) and cold foods cold (below 4 °C) and refrigerating leftovers at 4 °C or below promptly.\nAs you have learned in Unit 6 section 6.5. in detail about the beef meat \nprocessing, methods of meat processing in sheep and goat also include the following physical and chemical treatments such as salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, and/or the addition of chemical preservatives.\n7.5.2. Milk Production and Processing \nSheep’s milk production is reported in only a few countries in the tropics. \nSheep and goat’s milk is rarely sold. Compared to sheep milk, goat milk \nis commonly used. Under very favorable conditions the best sheep can produce 2.5 liters of milk per day, but 1.0 liter per day is regarded as excellent. In tropical environments, milk yields of 0.3 liter per ewe per day are more common (50 liters in a 100-day lactation). However, the efforts in genetic selection and better feeding conditions led to several superior goat and sheep breeds in some countries in terms of milk and solids productivity, proving a great potential for evolution in both species, and responding to increasing market demand and popularity, especially of cheeses from goat and sheep milk. Some sheep breeds can produce more than 1000 kg milk in one lactation and several goat breeds more than 2000 kg milk, but in physiologically comparable terms of 4% fat-corrected milk both species can be equal. The best Goat breed for milk production has been capable of producing 10 kg of milk per day of lactation.\nEwes are milked once a day. Lambs are separated from the ewes in the \nmorning while the ewes go out to graze. In the evening, the ewes are milked before they are returned to their lambs. Compared to cow’s milk, sheep’s milk has high solids content and is more concentrated in fat and protein. Goat milk contains less lactose, but its fat content is also much simpler for human digestion than cow milk. This means that the fat globules in goat milk are smaller and easier for our milk fat-dissolving enzyme lipase to break into smaller pieces as they pass through our gut."

Camel meat production has increased at a rate of 2.8% from 123,000 to 356,000 tones (t). The major camel meat producers are Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Somalia (Figure 8.8). The Sudan and Somalia export camel meat, while Saudi Arabia and Egypt are camel meat importers.\nFigure 8.8. Camel meat production in the countries producing more than 1000 tones (t)."

There are encouraging export opportunities in Egypt and Libya. Camels have low reproductive rate. This is a cause for them to be not efficient meat producers. Offtake rates of 3 to 5% might already constitute a stress on the camel population. \nAlthough many pastoralists consume camel meat when available, camels \nare rearly slaughtered for home consumption of meat. Only occasionally do camel herders slaughter camels at home. Funerals, weddings and religious festivals can be mentioned as examples of occasions in which slaughtering of camels at home can be observed. Camels injured in accidents can also be slaughtered. Camel meat is sold at butcher shops in towns such as Dire Dawa, Harar and Jijiga.\n8.5.2. Milk production and processing \nEthiopia produces about 4.2 million cubic meters of milk annually \naccording to 2021 reports. Out of this, 80% is cow milk. The rest comes from camels and goats. Milk is the most important camel production in arid and semi-arid environments of Eastern Africa. In this region, camel milk is a valuable food source for humans. The total dry matter content of camel milk ranges from 12 to 15%. The range of its protein content is 2.7 to 4.5%. What ranges from 2.9 to 5.2% is the fat content of camel milk, while the lactose content of the milk is 5.5%. \nThe milk has a high content of vitamin C. This may reach 2.9 mg/100 \ng. This is of special importance particularly in areas where food of plant origin is scarce. Reported daily yields of milk range from 3.5 to over 20 liters. The annual lactation yields vary from 800 to over 4000 liters. Lactation lengths show a large variation - eight months to almost two years, for example."

There are also four types according to utility or economic values: Egg type (e.g. Leghorn), Meat type (e.g. synthetic), Dual purpose (e.g. Rhode Island Red), and Ornamentals (e.g. Bantam).  \n9.1.1. Indigenous poultry breeds of Ethiopia\nThere are ten common local chicken breeds or ecotypes: Chefe, Gebsima, \nHorro, Jarso, Kei, Naked neck, Netch, Tepi, Tikur and Tilili. The indigenous \nchickens are non-descriptive breeds. They are closely related to the jungle \nfowl. They vary in color, comb type, body conformation, and weigh. They may or may not possess shank feathers. Broodiness (maternal instinct) is pronounced. Indigenous chickens have an inherent scavenging and nesting habit. They are more resistant to diseases, less prone to predator attacks and can survive under harsh nutritional and environmental conditions. Slow growth, late maturity and low production performance characterized Indigenous local chicken breeds. \n              Figure 9.1. Horro breed (A), Chefe breed (B) and Tepi breed (C).\n9.1.2.

Germs can be spread via animals and people. \nInfection is also possible through contact with infected objects such as crates or cars. All kinds of diseases can be transferred by birds, vermin, insects and other parasites. Remember that feed and dirty drinking water can also carry germs.\nThere are three main causes of poultry disease: Infectious (viral, bacterial), \nParasites, and deficiencies of a certain kind of nutrient. Other issues include feather pecking and cannibalism.\nNewcastle diseases, infectious bursal diseases, avian coccidiosis, helminth \ninfestation, ecto-parasite infestation, and Salmonella and Campylobacter infections are the most common chicken diseases.\nPoultry disease controlling methods:\n The best prevention of diseases is good hygiene and disinfect. \n  To use the ’All- in- all-out’ system. \n Vaccinate against some diseases or use anti-coccidial agents.\n In case of serious problems, consider slaughtering the whole stock \nand start anew.

Basic terms in aquaculture and farmed fish species in Ethiopia\nAquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms. Ethiopian fish fauna are \nthe bony fish. Fresh water contains the majority of teleost (i.e. the group contains most of the bony fishes) fish type.  Ethiopian fish fauna consists of 153 indigenous and 10 exotic species. The diversity and abundance of Ethiopian fish fauna is not complete and further works are still underway. The Ethiopian indigenous freshwater fauna is a mixture of three different forms.\n Nilo-sudanic forms,\n East African high land forms and\n Endemic forms. \nThese are the dominant forms in terms of diversity and are represented by a large number of species found in the Omo-Gibe, Baro-Akobo, Tekeze and Abay drainage basins. They are predominately found in the Nile basin (Baro-Akobo, Tekeze and Abay). However, some elements of these forms also occur in the Southern Rift Valley Lakes (Lakes Abaya and Chamo), and the Shebelle-Ghenale basins. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is also expected to have potential for fish farming. The Nilotic fishes are almost entirely absent from the Awash and northern rift valley lakes. The East African highland forms are those related to fishes of eastern and southern Africa and include genera such as Labeo, Barbus, Clarias, Garra, Oreochromis, and Varicorhinus. These are found in the northern Rift Valley lakes (e.g. Lakes Hawassa, Ziwai, Langano), the highland lakes (e.g. Tana and Hayq), and associated river systems, and the Awash drainage basin.\nThe endemic forms are very few comprising about 38 species and 2 \nsubspecies. Examples include a few genera such as Danakilia, Nemacheilus, and Gara (Lakes Abaya and Chamo), Barbus (Lakes Tana and Chamo), etc. Exotic fish that were introduced to Ethiopian water bodies include fish such as carp in Koka and Fincha dams. The economically important families of Ethiopian fish include the following."

Fish rearing management \nThere are three main events in the fish rearing or farming timeline: hatching, \nrearing, and harvesting.  Hatching includes caring for breeding colonies, inducing spawning, egg extraction or nursery isolation, etc. Once hatched, fry are then collected and moved to grow out ponds. Unlike other fish, fresh water fish like tilapia tend to be hardier against poor water quality . \nBest practice shows that the dissolved oxygen level should be around 4 mg/l. Low oxygen levels in water often lead to mass fish death. In terms of pH, tilapia can tolerate a wide range but a pH over 6.5 is good for algae growth which is useful as feed for the fish. Temperatures around 25 ºC are most favored by the fish. Tilapia can be stocked at densities up to 60 kg/m cubed (depending on water and management conditions). However, high stocking densities may have a negative impact on growth performance and health status. Low stocking densities, however, can often lead to aggression between the fish. Rearing, or grow-out, is the part of fish farming that picks up after the hatchery has raised them to fingerling size. Harvesting or processing involves selecting of tilapia and moving them to a finishing pond.Work in a group,\na. discuss the common fish culture techniques in Ethiopia\nb. reason for choosing these particular fish culture \nc. types of fish farming the students know so far\nReport the summary of your discussion to the whole class.Activity 10.4."

There are two major types of \nfishing gears, i.e. passive fishing gear and active fishing gear. Passive fishing gear is a device that is not moved by man or machine to \ncapture fish. The machine is set at a given position in the water and left for some times until the fish come to the gear to be caught. It is placed stationary in one place. Examples include long line, gill net, traps and pots, etc. \nOn the other hand, active fishing gears are towed or pulled in water column \nusing fishing crafts to catch the fish. These include trawl nets, seine nets, dredge nets, lift nets, etc. The major types of fishing methods used for fish include netting, lining, trolling, trawling and seining.

Fish and fish products deteriorate quickly.  The easy deterioration in fish quality is because of the post-mortem (after death) biological changes that take place in the body of dead fish. The central concern of fish processing is to prevent fish from deteriorating Therefore, fish and fish products need appropriate processing procedures in order to prevent deterioration. Changes in fish quality often come in the form of unpleasant odor and microbial spoilage.\nStages of fish processing\nFish processing stages can be classified as preliminary and main stages depending on the extent of application of techniques and skills. Stages of fish processing are:\nPreliminary Processing\nThis stage is also referred to as pre-processing stage. Preliminary processing \nof fish usually consists of grading, removal of slime, beheading, scaling, washing, cutting of fins, gutting and evisceration, slicing of whole fish into steaks and skinning. The process can also includes filleting, grinding of skinned fillets, meat-bone separation, or various combinations of these.  \nMain Processing Stage\nFish Preservation is the creation of unfavorable condition for the growth \nor survival of spoilage organisms. Ancient methods of preserving fish included drying, salting, pickling and smoking. All of these techniques are used today but the more modern techniques of freezing and canning have taken on a large importance.This stage is mainly concerned with fish preservation processes.

Low pH discourages the growth of spoilage microorganisms.\n10.8. Diseases in Aquaculture\nMicroorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, water molds (fungi), and parasites \ncause diseases of freshwater fish in warm-water aquaculture. Some of these agents are obligate pathogens (require a host for survival in nature), but many do not require a host and can be found living in aquaculture waters. These microorganisms facultative agents are opportunistic and cause problems when the host’s resistance is compromised.\nThe most common pathogens that affect aquaculture include:\nViral diseases: The most serious viral disease is channel catfish virus \ndisease (CCVD). This is most commonly found in juvenile channel catfish during their first summer of life. Channel catfish virus is a herpesvirus that attacks swim-up fry to 10 cm fingerlings when water temperatures are 25 °C or above. Mortality due to CCVD can be acute and reach up to 90 percent, especially in densely populated tanks or ponds.\nBacterial diseases: Bacteria cause more infectious disease problems than \nany other group of pathogens in warm-water aquaculture. The motile aeromonad septicemia (MAS) is a common disease of fish, including salmonids, and other aquatic animals that inhabit freshwater, but MAS can also occur in brackish water. The motile aeromonads are a heterogeneous group of ubiquitous, mesophilic, gram-negative bacteria that are also a normal component of the microbial flora of fish (Lim and  Webster, 2001).In small groups, discuss fish and fish product handling methods. \nReport the summary of  your discussion with other groups.Activity 10.7."

As a result, the bulk of the fish harvest from the lakes is sold fresh. However, frozen filets are increasingly being marketed in lakeside towns as well as in the capital city, Addis Ababa. \nSmoking and drying is carried out only on some remote fishing locations. \n“ Quanta ”, which is a dried fish product, is largely available around Arba-Minch. The product is obtained by filleting the fish, cutting them into large strips and hanging them up on strings to dry for two to three days. The dry product can be packed in sacks for storage on the floor. Once packed, it can be stored for up to a month without substantial quality deterioration. \nDrying is increasingly becoming a method frequently used to preserve \nexcess catches. Dried fish is becoming more available in large consumption centres such as Addis Ababa and at the expatriate market. \nTraders face major storage problems due to the shortage of basic cold \nchains or cooling systems.

There are over 7000 \nmelliferous plant species in Ethiopia. All these that produce significant amounts of nectar and pollen which makes them appearing to bees. Due to bimodal rains, honey can be harvested at least twice a year. Five wild bee species have been identified. It is estimated that more than 2 million bee colonies exist in the forests and crevices in Ethiopia. According to Mohammed and Hassen (2021), Ethiopia has the potential to produce up to 500,000 tons of honey and 50,000 tons of beeswax per annum. \nApiculture is an integral part of agriculture in Ethiopia. It contributes \nmarkedly to household income and national economy. Honey is produced in almost all parts of Ethiopia. Honey bees provide pollination services that are crucial for sexual reproduction in many plants. This helps in improving the quality and quantity of many agricultural crops. From the significant 53 crops cultivated in Ethiopia, 33 (62.2%) of them are dependent on biological pollinators. Besides, honey bees play a vital economic role, and their contribution to pollination service in agricultural crops is at around 0.815 billion dollars in Ethiopia, which is 6.24% of the agricultural GDP (Getachew, 2018). Nevertheless, this contribution is unnoticed by Ethiopian farmers. Pollination by honey bees plays an essential role in human nutrition and food security, income in households, and ecosystem services. \n11.2. Bee biology and behavior\nHoney bee biology Honey bees are one of the few insects that have a social structure. Honey bees have a caste or role. A hive consists of a single reproductive queen, numerous drones, and about 60,000 worker bees. The reproductive queen lays all the eggs in the honeybee colony. Drones are male honeybees. \nDo these questions in a small group. Share your answers with the other pairs.\na. How many times do beekeepers harvest honey per year?\nb.

Several thousand worker bees cooperate in nest building, food collection, and brood rearing. Each honey bee in the worker caste has an age-related task to perform. The task begins inside the hive (house bee) and eventually moves to foraging outside the hive. The immature forms of the bee are called brood, they are fed and cared for by the worker bee caste.\nFigure 11.1. Classes of insects\nHoney bees have the following physical characteristics. They:\n1. have two pairs of thin, veined wings with the forewings much larger than the hindwings. \n2. have chewing-lapping mouth parts with a long tongue or proboscis to suck nectar out of flowers and mandibles (jaws) to manipulate wax or other materials. \n3. undergo complete metamorphosis during development. \n4. have three major body regions: the head, thorax, and abdomen. \n5. have a constriction or “thin waist” separating the thorax and abdomen."

They \nhave been involved in agriculture using limited resources under harsh and insecure conditions. The following are some of the traditional knowledge practiced by beekeepers in different part of Ethiopia:\nTraditional honeybee feeding practices:  Where there is little honeybee \nforage, beekeepers provide supplementary feeds like flour of roasted grain \nof barely as well as that of maize, bean and pea in order to strengthen the colony for the next season.\nTraditional swarm control: A lack of space is the main causes of \nswarming. Traditionally, beekeepers make use of indicators to control swarming. For example, they try to identify the sound of the queen during the night. If there is a piping sound by queen then the colony is close to swarming. \nTraditional swarm catching and baiting hives management: The \nuse of baiting hives to catch swarm is part of the traditional beekeeping practices in many places in Ethiopia. Baiting hives are prepared and smoked very well using barks of Ekebergiacapensi (sombo). The farmers may sometimes use honeycomb, body soap, and spray perfume in the inner part of baiting hives to attract scout bees.\nTraditional use of honey as medicine: The type of medicine prepared \nfrom honey, its utilization (see in Table 11.1) and harvest time may vary from place to place.

Observations of pollen on the leg of bees helps the beekeepers to conclude that bees are brood rearing. If the legs of bees are free then they are honey making and there is a possibility to obtain mature honey. Beekeepers also insert a thin stick or metal into the hive which they immediately withdraw and examine.

The general rule of thumb is to cover seeds with soil equal to three times their thickness – but be sure to read the seed packet planting instructions carefully. Some seeds, including certain lettuc -\nes and snapdragons, need light to germinate. They should rest on the soil surface but still be in good contact with moist soil. Gentle tamping after sowing will help.  After planting the seeds, use a spray bottle to wet the soil again.\n4. Water \nUse Water wisely. Always use room-temperature water. Let chlorinated water sit overnight so chlorine can dissipate or use distilled water. Avoid using softened water. It’s important to keep soil consistently moist, but avoid overwatering. Overwatering promotes diseases that can kill seed-lings. Try not to splash water on leaves. \n5. Maintain Moisture\nMaintain consistent moisture. Prior to germination, cover your container to help trap moisture inside. Use a plastic bag, but it should be supported so it doesn’t lay flat on the soil. Remove covers as soon as seeds sprout. Once seedlings are growing, reduce watering so soil partially dries, but don’t let In small group\nDiscuss methods of producing plants from seeds in a nursery.Activity 12.1."

They germinate \nslower, or not at all, in soils that are too cool. Most seeds will germinate at around 78°F. After germination, air temperature should be slightly below 70°F. Seedlings can withstand air temperature as low as 50°F as long as soil temperature remains 65-70°F..\n7. Fertilize\nStart feeding your seedlings after they develop their second set of true leaves Apply a half-strength liquid fertilizer weekly.  Apply it gently so seedlings are not dislodged from the soil. After four weeks, apply full-strength liquid fertilizer every other week until transplanting.\n8. Light \nGive seedlings enough light. Not enough light leads to leggy, tall seedlings that will struggle once transplanted outdoors. Seedlings often require protection from full sun. Shade reduces watering requirements and stress to seedlings. Partial shade is better than complete shade; the latter can raise humidity which can increase the proliferation of plant diseases. Also, too much shade causes etiolation, which means a plant’s main stems grow spindly and weak. Thus, allow more sunlight to get through. . Ideally, seedlings need 14-16 hours of direct light per day for healthiest growth \n9. Air\nCirculate the air.

Plantation establishment and management\nThe success of fuel wood and small timber plantations is largely dependent \nupon careful establishment and management in the early stages of growth. This is of special importance in fuel wood plantations utilizing nitrogen-fixing tree species. Thus the major portion of labor and material inputs to community forestry plantings should be during the initial 12-18 months. During this time crucial establishment management operations must be carried out. Plantations may be established from seedlings, stem cuttings, or direct seeding. Each of these types of plantings must be done during periods of adequate rainfall, and must be protected from weeds and nests.\nWeed control is the most important maintenance operation. \nFertilization  is a practice used to increase production on millions of \nhectares of forest land every year. \nIn order to sustain production on a single site, the negative effects of \nharvesting must be minimized. This can be done by attending to:\n Fertility management.  Care must be taken to retain many of the nutrients taken up by trees on the site. Nutrient losses might be minimized by allowing harvested trees to dry on the site before removal to allow leaves to dry, fall off and remain on the site.

Agro forestry can be particularly important for smallholder farmers because it generates diverse products and services on a limited land area. . \nEconomic benefitsMost agro forestry systems aim to increase or maintain the production \nand productivity of farming systems; reduce agricultural inputs and thus production costs; and diversify production by the use of trees or other woody perennials to produce, for example, food, fodder, lumber, building materials and wood fuel. Agro forestry can help reduce rural poverty by increasing on-farm production and household income and by providing employment opportunities.\nSocial benefits\nAn increase in production, productivity and product diversity through \nagro forestry can help improve the health and nutrition of the rural poor. The on-farm production of fuel, fodder and other tree products, otherwise collected from off-farm sources, can reduce the time and effort needed to obtain them (often lessening the burden on women) or save money if the products would otherwise be purchased. The perpetuation of traditional agro forestry practices can help maintain social bonds established through mutual-help arrangements (e.g. in the case of shifting cultivation).\nEnvironmental benefits\nAgro forestry systems can provide a range of environmental services. For \nexample, they can improve soil fertility, protect crops and livestock from wind, restore degraded lands, improve water conservation, limit pests and prevent soil erosion.

Overgrazing is caused by intensive cattle rising. As plants don’t have the recovery period they need, they end up being crushed and compacted by cattle. In this process, topsoil sediments are transported elsewhere. As for the remaining soil, it can lose its infiltration capacity. Tillage is the mechanical manipulation of soil with tools and all has all along been contributing negatively to soil quality.

Farmers take measures such as sufficiently drying maize before storage, using storage structures which are moisture proof and are adequately aired as mechanisms to reduce losses incurred after harvest. \nThere are different forms of traditional storage structures that are generally \nmade of locally available materials.  Similarly, farmers use botanicals and wood ash for the same purpose. \nIn case of  animal origin foods (milk and meat), farmers predominantly use \nsmoking, natural fermentation and proper casing using locally available plant materials  as shown in Figure. 16.5.  \n(A) (B)\nFigure 16.5. Ethiopian whole sour milk (ergo) (A), and fresh butter (B).\nUnderground Storage (Pit): Grains such as sorghum and maize are stored underground in some parts of the Ethiopia, but it is unusual for teff  to be stored in such pits. Underground pit grain storage is common in dry lands of Ethiopia where there is a shortage of wood and other materials for construction of above the ground storage bins. The pit gate is covered with a combination of locally available materials such as strips of timber, stone, soil, animal dung and mud.\nAbove-the-Ground Traditional Storage Structure: Gombissa is an \nabove-the-ground cylindrical shaped traditional storage bin used to store \nmaize cob. It is type of circular granary, made by interweaving locally available materials; mostly bamboo split by local artisans. It is an outdoor container made from split or whole bamboo poles or other tree sticks. The roof is thatched by dry grass/ hay or corrugated iron sheet. It is usually raised off the ground, and placed on stones or a wooden platform."

They also disrupt the behavior and physiology of insects in various ways. Botanicals include spices, medicinal weeds and other plants.\nWood Ash: Wood ash has been used for centuries  as a botanical pesticide \nagainst maize storage insect pests.\nStoring unshelled maize: Maize cobs that are completely covered by the \nhusk are less infested than those whose tips are slightly exposed.\nMixing with sand and dust: Inert dusts are chemically unreactive and thus, used for protecting stored grains by physical means.\nMixing with small size grain: Many farmers in Ethiopia have reported  \nmixing teff with maize grain for  protection from insect attack in the \nstorage. Teff admixture with maize provides effective protection of grain from insect pests in storage.\nFigure 16.7. Traditional milk utensils (A= Okkole; B= Gorfa)."

Roles of ICT in Agriculture\nAgriculture is increasingly becoming knowledge-intensive and millions of \nsmallholder farmers around the world are confronted by constraints such as poor access to markets and financial services, low levels of human and physical capital, poor access to education and weak information flows. Given the present market scarcity, low skills and weak capacity, agriculture across the developing world will have to overcome a number of challenges in the future. \nICT has provided a possible pathway to better access, efficiency, and \naffordability of agricultural information. The use of ICT can improve business and networking between farmers, buyers, and extension agents (Figure 17.2.). It also facilitate access to reliable  markets. ICT has further made innovations that bring financial services, including mobile money, to smallholder farmers.\nFigure 17.1. Smallholder farmers’ use of mobile phones for agriculture.\nMoreover, ICT facilitates electronic-agriculture and has advantages such as improving productivity and profitability, efficient management and utilization of resources, to get important and timely information about weather conditions, and improved agricultural technologies. \nThe information needs of farmers will only increase as farmers have to \nmake more and more complex decisions on how to use their land, what crops/livestock products to produce, and how, and, where to buy inputs and sell their products. Their decisions, which also include choices on how to finance their business and reduce the risk they face, impact the livelihoods of their families and society."

Electronic-agriculture describes an emerging field focused on the enhancement of agricultural and rural development through improved information and communication processes. A World Bank (2009) report on ICT for development indicated that connectivity, whether through the internet or mobile phones, is increasingly bringing market information, financial services, and health services to remote areas, and is helping to change people’s lives in unprecedented ways. ICT and mobile-enabled agricultural services act as instruments to deliver extension services and help to create awareness amongst farmers. In most developing countries, however, the extension system does not have a modern mechanism like ICT to acquire and deliver information to farmers. There are research efforts to check the challenges and opportunities of ICT application by \nengaging extension workers in rural areas (Figure 17.3).\nFigure 17.3.
