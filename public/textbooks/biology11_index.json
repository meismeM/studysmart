Scientists and engineers learn from nature through imitation \nof physical structures, shapes, materials and \nfunctional mechanisms of natural facts.  The better their understanding the diverse nature of biological materials, the better their ability \nto develop technologies.

Ethical treatment of plants\nPlants are primary producers and feeders for all living organisms. Trees are living organisms that \nproperly function in decentralized forms without any centralized order-providing unit (brain). Subjecting plant species to severe life-treating conditions leads to a total disappearance of plant \nspecies. Collecting seeds, berries, roots, leaves, bark or flowers for personal uses, medicaments, \nand other purposes (tooth brushing) affect the survival of the plant species and the community that depends on the plants Unethical treatment of plants: \nTesting seeds or berries through destructive rays \nCutting tree terminals for experiments \nConsumption of all seeds and fruits without conservation \nUnplanned cutting of trees or deforestation \nBurning forests and seedlings for farmlands \nRestructuring the shapes of trees for aesthetic appeal \nCare for plants is an ethical treatment and important for saving the jeopardized species and conserve for our common future. It is ethical to plant trees and it is a national responsibility.  \n1.4.1.2. \nEthical treatment of animals in experiments \nIn biological studies, researchers use animals to gain scientific understanding of the world. The \nethical treatment of animals is a moral question of whether it is acceptable to harm animals for scientific research. Animals are sentient creatures that have a nervous system, feel painful feelings , \nemotional stress, and have interests and values. Given this, it is unethical to harm animals during experiments or rigorous testing. Unethical treatments of animals in research include approach es which expose animals to rigorous \nexperiment that may injure or cause pain to animals. \nResearchers must reduce impacts of unethical treatments of animals through the three Rs\nprinciples described below (Reduction, Refinement, and Replacement).\nWhat are treatments?\nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                        MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, ETHIOPIA 14"

This group of animals \nis the most diverse group of animals in the world. \nThey are found almost everywhere, from the hottest \ndeserts and the deepest seabeds to the darkest caves and the highest mountains. \n Invertebrate animals lack a rigid internal skeletal \nsystem. Many invertebrates are soft -bodied. \nHowever, some of them have an external \nskeleton called an exoskeleton , usually made of \nchitin, which protects their soft inner bodies. \nInvertebrates are cold -blooded, and hence, do \nnot regulate their body temperature. This group \nincludes earthworms, insects, spiders, snails, \nsponges, jellyfish, l obsters, crabs, sea stars, and \nsquid .\n2.2.2 Vertebrate Animals \nVertebrates are the most advanced groups in the animal kingdom. They are a highly advanced group of animals. \nThese groups of animals possess a well-defined internal \nskeleton system with cartilage and a backbone or vertebral column separated into an  axial skeleton \n(skull, vertebrae, ribs and sternum) and appendicular skeleton (girdles and appendages). The skull \nand vertebrae protect the highly dev eloped brain and the \nnerve cord respectively.\nVertebrates have more complex and specialized organ \nsystems such as the circulatory systems, respiratory systems, nervous systems, and excretory systems. The circulatory \nsystem is a closed circulatory system with a ventral heart \nhaving 2-4 chambers and a median dorsal artery. The respiratory system consists of either gills or lungs. They have a centralized nervous system with a brain and sensory \norgans (eyes, ears, nostrils).

Asexual reproduction in animals \nAs you have learned in previous grades, asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction that involves \na single individual and does not require the fusion of gametes from two parents. Asexual \nreproduction in animals is more common among invertebrates than in vertebrates. Budding and \nfragmentation are the most common forms of asexual reproduction especially in aquatic animals. \n The other form of asexual reproduction in animals is parthenogenesis. In this type of reproduction, \nunfertilized eggs develop into new offspring as in some insects and vertebrates \n2.3.2 Sexual reproduction in animals \nIn previous grades, you learned that sexual reproduction is a type of reproduction that involves two \nindividual parents and requires the fusion of gametes from two parents (male and female). It \nproduces offspring that have genetic material from both parents. The parents are diploid organisms \nwith a complete set of chromosomes (2n). \nSexual reproduction involves different male and female reproductive structures with different \nfunctions. One of the most important functions is the production of haploid cells called gametes (n) \nfor the transmission of genetic information from parents to offspring. \nIn sexual reproduction, males produce sperm and haploid cells (n) in the testes where sperm cells \nare stored in the epididymis until ejaculation. On the other hand, females produce \nan ovum or egg haploid cell (n) that matures in the ovary and the fusion of sperm cells with female \ngametes produces a zygote through the process of fertilization. There are two types of fertilization: Inquiry activity 2.5 Studying a sexual reproduction\nBe in groups and search from the library or internet and  \n1.Discuss in class the following forms of asexual reproduction: budding, \nfragmentation, parthenogenesis, etc. with specific examples of animals that undergo \nthis type of reproduction.\n2.What common features have you observed in budding, fragmentation and \nparthenogenesis as a form of asexual reproduction?\nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                        MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, ETHIOPIA 26"

In the next section, we shall see the similarities and differences between \nexternal and internal fertilization.\nIn animals that use internal fertilization, the eggs are released from the ovary into the uterine \ntubes for fertilization, but eggs are released into the aqueous environment in animals that use external fertilization. The fertilization of an egg by sperm produces a single-celled diploid fertilized egg called a zygote (2n), which develops into an embryo and then into an individual organism. The \ngeneral animal life cycle in sexual reproduction is shown below (Figure 2.2).  \nFigure 2.2 Sexual reproduction and life cycle of animals \nAfter fertilization, a series of developmental stages occur in embryonic development (Figure 2.3). \nThe first stage is cleavage, which involves a series of mitotic cell divisions of the fertilized egg \n(zygote). This cell division results in an eight-celled structure. The second stage is another cell division and rearrangement of cells into hollow structures called blastulae. Then, the blastula \nundergoes further cell division and rearrangement with the process called gastrulation.  \nThe process of gastrulation produces a gastrula that has different cell layers called “germ layers”. \nBy the process of organogenesis, these germ layers later develop into different tissue types, organs, and organ systems. Organogenesis is the formation of organs during embryonic development. The \nembryo eventually develops into an adult with all tissue types, organs, and organ systems.\nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                                  FDRE-MoE ETHIOPIA  27"

This type pest regulation  is \nknown as a natural biological control, which destroys  harmful insec ts that infect both animals \nand plants. This natural biological control plays an important role in limiting potential pest \npopulations. \nImportant insects in pest regulation include mantis, lady beetles, ground beetles, rove beetles, \nflower bugs, lacewings and hover flies. For example, Stagmomantis insects , species of mantis\nfeed on grasshoppers and caterpillars that damage crops. Chilomenes ,a ladybird beetle, feed \non aphids that damage cotton plants anddestroys scale worms that are pests of orange and \nlemon trees respectively . Epicauta, a blister beetle, eat up masses of the eggs of locusts\n(Figure 2. 22).\nFigure  2.22 Stagmomantis(left),Cheilomenes sulfurea(middle), Epicauta,  Blister beetle(right) \nInsects also play a great role in feeding  on unwanted weeds, creating channels for smaller \norganisms water, air, and roots to travel through to improve soil aeration.  Their activities can \nenhance  the nutrient cycle and physical properties of the soil, such as soil structure and tilt, and \ndecomposers can help in the biochemical cycling of  nutrients. \nB. Food \nMany species of insects are being used as a food for people in many countries. Evidence suggests \nthat edible insects have potential to become a valuable protein source for addressing the global food demand. They are widely recognized as a sustainable source of animal protein. There are over 1,462 recorded species of edible insects in the world. Most insects are consumed in Asia and \nCentral America. Usually crickets, grasshoppers, beetle and moth larvae and termites are eaten \nthere.  \nBeing rich source of protein, grasshoppers have been eaten in  many parts of the world. Moreover, \ninsects are important sources of food for many vertebrates, including birds, amphibians, reptiles, \nfish and mammals.  One of the many ways to address food and feed security for the over increasingly growing world population is through insect farming.

Industry \nOne of the benefits of insect related to industries is their role in commercial products.  Insects are \nbeing used to produce different materials at home and in industries. The following are some of the \nexamples. \n Production of Honey and Bee Wax: Honey and \nwax production are considered some of the \ncommercial benefits of insects. For example, the \nhoneybees ( Apismeliffera L.) produce millions of \ntons of honey and wax every year around the \nworld.  \n Production of Silk: The other commercially \nbeneficial insects are silk worms (Bombyx mori and \nother silk worms). Silkworms produce silk fibers, which are woven into the delicate, smooth material used for luxurious textiles and for different purposes in the textile industry (Figure \n2.23).\nFigure 2. 23Silkworm (Left)  Silk thread s(Right)\nProduction of shellac:  shellac is a resin secreted by Lac insects.

Tiny wasps in the family Cynipidae secrete some chemical and in response to this,  the tree produces gall \ntissues that contain tannic acid.  \nD. Health and medicine\nSome insects have medicinal value in treating different \nhuman and animal diseases. Since ancient times, \ninsects and insect -derived products  have been used as \nmedicinal agents in many parts of the world. . For \ninstance, honey is applied to treat burns, chronic and \npost-surgical wounds. Bee and ant venom are used to \ntreat joints pain. Recent research confirms that bee \nproducts promote healthy immune systems, improve \ncirculation and decrease inflammation\n Blister beetles secrete cantharidan, which acts as a powerful protein blocker in the human body \nand is effective in treating severe viral infections because it prevents the reproduction of some viral \ncells. Researchers subsequently discovered that cantharidan reacts with genetic material of hostile \ncells, and therefore may be useful in the treatment of cancerous tumors most resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. Several African cultures use poultices made from ground grasshoppers as pain \nrelievers, especially for migraines . \n2.4.2 Harmful aspects of insects \nAlthough most insects are beneficial, they can also be harmful \nto humans and animals. Some insects are pests of plants, fruits, \nand grains in a store. They feed on several parts of green plants \nand crops, such as leaves, stems, buds, flowers, fruits, and seeds on fields and in stores at home thereby damaging crops and reducing production.

Countries have faced threats of swarms of desert locusts.  Consequently, regional and international organizations have started to monitor \ndesert locust populations and launch control \nmeasures when necessary. Locusts are particularly destructive in hot and dry regions when there is a sudden increase in their numbers.  The prevalence of food shortage has further forced  them to \nmigrate. They migrate in huge swarms, for several \nkilometers away devouring virtually every green \nplant in their path. \nSome insects are also regarded as serious pests for stored cereal grains. The most common insect \npests of stored cereal grains are: Rice Weevil (\nSitophilus oryzae ); Lesser Grain Borer ( Rhyzopertha \ndominica ); Rust Red Flour Beetle: ( Tribolium spp.); Sawtooth Grain Beetle: ( Oryzaephilus \nsurinamensis ); Flat Grain Beetle: ( Cryptolestes  spp.) \nFigure 2. 24 Crops destroyed by desert locusts (left) and other insects (middle and right) \nMoreover, several insects serve as vectors for transmitting diseases from one organism to another \nor serve as intermediate hosts for several pathogens and transfer disease from one to another. For \nexample, Anopheles mosquitoes transfer malarial parasites, “ Plasmodium, ” from one person to \nanother. Culex mosquitos spread filariasis and transmit filarial worms from infected to healthy \npeople.

F or example, when you \ntouch a sharp or hot object, you pull your hand away rapidly without even thinking about \nthe action. You blink when something gets too close to your eye and you close your eyes when dust gets into them. These are simple reflex actions. During a reflex action, messages \nabout pain do not travel all the way to and from the brain. Instead, they travel only as far as the spinal cord, and the spinal cord responds to the messages by giving orders to the \nmuscles. This allows you to respond to p ain more quickly.\nThe following examples are orientation  behaviours in animals.\nTaxis is directed in relation to a given stimulus .It is the orientation of an animal \n(directed either towards or away) in response to the source of\nstimulus. If the orientati on is towards the stimulus, it is called as a positive taxis ,and \nif it is away from the stimulus, it is known as a negative taxis . \nExample: The movement of cockroaches away from the source of light. \nWhat is the difference between phototaxis, \nchemotaxis, thigmotaxis and geotaxis? Explain with \nexamples. \nKinesis is undirected, random movement. Kinesis is a type of locomotory behavior in \nrelation to the source of stimulus. The animal responds to the variation in the intensity \nofthe stimulus and not the sou rce or direction of the stimulus.  \nExample: The movement of woodlice in relation to the temperature around them.  \nLearned or acquired behavior  \nLearned or acquired behavior is not inherited \nand not determined by genes.

This is a form of non-associative \nlearning, in which the stimulus is not linked with any punishment or reward. For example, you were reading a book when someone turned on the television in the same room. At \nfirst, the sound of the television might have \nbeen annoying. After a while, you may no longer have it noticed. Accordingly, it mean that you have become accustomed to the \nsound.\nClassical conditioning is a result of \nassociative learning in which a response \nalready associated with one stimulus is \nassociated with a second stimulus to which it \nhad no previous connection. Classical conditioning was discovered by Ivan P. Pavlov, a Russian physiologist. There are \nthree stages of classical conditioning.\nStage 1:  Before conditioning. This stage \nstates that an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) \nproduces an unconditioned response (UCR) in \nan individual, which means that a stimulus in \nthe environment has produced a behavior or response which is unlearned (i.e., unconditioned), and therefore it is a natural \nresponse which has not been taught. In this \ncase, no new behavior has been learned yet.Stage 2:  During conditioning. During this \nstage, a stimulus that produces no response is \nassociated with the unconditioned stimulus, \ndue to wh at it is known as a conditioned \nstimulus (CS). For learning to take place, the \nUCS must be associated with CS on a number \nof occasions, or trials at this stage.  . \nStage 3:  After conditioning. This conditioning \nhappens once the conditioned stimulus (CS) \nhas been associated with the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) to create a new conditioned \nresponse. \nOperant conditioning  is a result of \nassociative learning in which a bit different \nfrom classical conditioning because it does not \nrely on an existing stimulus-response pair. Instead, whenever an organism performs a behavior or an intermediate step on the way to the complete behavior, the organism is \ngiven a reward or a punishment. It was \ndiscovered by B.F. Skinner. Based on the theory of operant conditioning, behavior will likely be repeated when the organism is \nreinforced (rewarded), and behavior will occur \nless frequently when it is punished.\nSkinner identified three types of responses or \noperant behavior.\nNeutral operants  are responses \nfrom the environment that neither \nincrease nor decrease the probability \nof a behavior being repeated. \nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                        MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, ETHIOPIA 50"

A change in these \nsituations may negatively affect the \nphysiological functions of their bodies. Hence, they need to have a controlling mechanism for these factors in order to maintain stability in their body. Despite \nenvironmental changes, most animals \nmaintain almost constant internal body \nconditions through homeostasis. \nHomeostasis is the self-regulatory process \nby which animals maintain stable internal conditions in their \nbodies regardless of external condition. Homeostasis helps animals to maintain equilibrium in the internal conditions of their bodies or cells at a set point (normal conditions). Animal \nbody systems constantly adjust to internal and external \nchanges in order to maintain this normal condition. A change \nin the internal or external environment (st imulus) is detected by receptors in the animals’ bodies, \nwhich sends information to a control center (the brain). As a result, the body system responds to \nthe stimulus and by returning the value back or toward the set point. Generally, homeostasis \ninvolves four component: stimulus, receptor, control center, and effector.\nStimulus: is a change in the environment that forces the organism to response. It can be a \nchange in body condition, such as an increase or decrease in body temperature, glucose, or \nwater. \nWhat happens to you during a \ncold day and a h ot day? Why \ndo you feel thirst?

This \nenables animals to function in the changing external and internal conditions that surround them.  \n2.6.1 Thermoregulation \nThermoregulation is the process of maintaining the \ninternal body temperature constant. Many \norganisms use behaviour, physiology, and \nmorphology to keep their body temperatures within optimal level .Based on temperature regulation, \nanimals can be divided into two groups: \n1.Poikilothermic animals : These are animals \nthat have a body temperature that is the same as their environment where their \ntemperature varies with the environmental \ntemperature are called poikilothermic animals. . \n2.Homeothermic animals : Animals that keep their body temperature constant in the face of \nchanging environmental temperatures.  \nA.Poikilothermic Animals \nPoikilothermic animals, also known as ectothermic animals, lack internal control over their body \ntemperature. The body temperature of these organisms is generally similar to the temperature of \nthe environment. However, individual organisms may burrow themselves into the ground on a hot day or rest in the sunlight on a cold day to keep their bodies temperature slightly below or above the e nvironmental temperature.

Their cellular processes operate optimally even \nwhen the environment is cold and loses heat when the environment is hot. They use morphological, \nphysiological and behavioral methods of temperature regulation.  \nHomeothermic animals can retain heat in a variety of ways when the environment is cold. Some of \nthe ways of insulation used to conserve the body heat in these animals include fur, fat and feathers. \nFor example, the arctic fox uses its fluffy tail as extra insulation when it curls up to sleep in cold weather (Figure 2.33). Homeothermic animals also use vasoconstriction in response to the coldest \nenvironment.   Vasoconstrictionis the narrowing of blood vessels to the skin by the contraction of \ntheir smooth muscles to reduce blood flow in t he peripheral blood vessels and retain heat. Shivering \nis another way of maintaining body temperature in cold. Shivering is caused by involuntary \ncontractions of your muscles. Muscle contractions require energy from respiration that releases heat \nto warm the body.\nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                                  FDRE-MoE ETHIOPIA  57"

Vasodilation is the \nwidening of blood vessels at the skin surface to increase heat loss through the surface of \nthe skin. \nSweating is another way of maintaining body \ntemperature during a hot season. Sweat, which is produced by the sweat glands  \ntravels up the sweat duct and out of the \nsweat pore onto the skin surface.  \nThe processes of coordination occur in the \npart of the brain called hypothalamus. When the temperature of the environment changes \n(decreases or increases), signals are sent to \nthe brain to alert the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus then responds by activating the process of vasodilation, vasoconstriction, \nshivering and sweating to maintain the body \ntemperature constant (Figure 2. 34).  \nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                        MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, ETHIOPIA 58"

About 60% of the human body is composed of fluids. \nApproximately 2/3 of our body’s water content is in our intracellular fluids and the remaining 1/3 \nforms our extracellular fluid . Extracellular fluid consists of the fluid between cells (interstitial fluid ) \nand the blood  plasma. A disruption in the osmotic pressure can result in an imbalance in the \nmovement of water between them and hence alter the concentration of their electrolytes. Hence, \nosmoregulation is important to balance osmotic pressure of fluids and electrolytes . \nIn humans and other animals, this process is brought about by osmoreceptors, which can detect \nchanges in osmotic pressure. Humans and most other warm-blooded organisms have \nosmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, part of the brain and in the kidneys. \nThere are two major types of osmoregulation:  \nOsmoconformers : organisms that try to match the osmolarity of their body with their \nsurroundings are called osmoconformers. In other words, these organisms maintain the same \nosmotic pressure inside the body as outside water. Examples are invertebrates like starfish, jellyfish \nand lobsters.  \nOsmoregulators : organisms that actively regulate their osmotic pressure, independent of the \nsurrounding environment are called osmoregulators . Examples are many vertebrates, including \nhumans.  \nThe kidney is the main organ responsible for osmoregulation in humans.

The body requires volumes of glucose in order to generate energy during respiration . Hence, \nthe body regulates the availability of glucose in our body to maintain its concentration at constant level in order to supply energy continuously . \nTwo hormones produced from pancreas are responsible for controlling the concentration of glucose in the blood. These are insulin  and glucagon\n.  \nWhen blood glucose level is high and the glucagon level is low, more insulin is released by \nthe pancreas into the liver. Insulin promotes the conversion of glucose into glycogen so that \nthe excess glucose can be stored for a later use in the liver. \nWhen blood glucose level is low and glucagon level is high, more glucagon is released by pancreas into the liver. Glucagon promotes the conversion of glycogen into glucose so that \nthe lack of glucose can be compensated for by the new supply of glucose.  \nGlycogen is stored in the liver and converted in to glucose when the glucose level decreases.

To do this, animals have feedback mechanisms for the stimulus (change in the environment). A feedback mechanism i s a \nphysiological regulation system to return the body to its normal internal state. In the feedback mechanism, the receptor senses the change in the environment (stimulus) and \nsends a signal to the control center (the \nbrain) which in turn generates a response that is signaled to an effector in muscles to contract or relax or glands to secrete \nhormones. There are two types of feedback \nmechanisms.  \nTo maintain homeostasis, animals   types of \nfeedback mechanisms: Negative and positive \nfeedback. Negative feedback occurs when a \nchange in a variable triggers a response that reverses the initial change. In other words, negative feedback occurs when the activation \nof one component results in the deactivation \nof another. Positive feedback occurs when a change in a variable triggers a response that causes more change in the same direction.\nUnlike negative feedback, positive feedback\noccurs when the activation of one component \ncauses the activation of another.Negative and positive feedback \nmechanisms \n Negative feedback mechanism is a \nhomeostatic process that reverses the direction of the stimulus or any deviation from the normal. This means that if the level is too \nhigh from the normal, the body brings it \ndown, and if the level is too low from the normal, the body lifts it up. In contrast to negative feedback mechanism, positive feedback mechanism accelerates a change in \nthe body’s physiological condition rather than \nreversing it. The positive feedback takes you further away from homeostasis while the \nnegative feedback brings you back to it. \nA negative feedback system has three basic \ncomponents. These are sensor (receptor), control center and effector . The sensor \n(receptor) monitors the physiological value \nnot to deviate from the normal (receives \nstimulus) and reports to the control center if there is any deviation. The control center compares the value of the deviation from the \nnormal and activates the effector if there is \nany deviation. An effector causes a change to reverse the situation and returns the value to \nthe normal set point (Figure 2. 38).\nThere are numerous examples of negative \nfeedback mechanisms that aid in maintaining a constant internal body condition. One of the examples in humans is the feedback \nmechanism in temperature regulation.  This \nmechanism works by promoting either heat loss or heat gain.

Insect are important organisms for commercial products such as honey, wax, \ndyes and silk production and have medicinal \nvalue in treating different human and animal \ndiseases. \nAnimals have different behaviours that can be \ngrouped into innate or inherent behavior and  \nlearned or acquired behavior. Animals also \nhave different behavioral patterns such as behavioral cycles, reproductive behavior, \nsocial behavior, competition, territory and \ncommunication. \nHomeostasis is a self- regulatory process by \nwhich animals maintain stable internal \nconditions in their body. Thermoregulation is \nthe process of maintaining the internal body temperature constant. Homeothermic animals maintain a constant body temperature \nregardless of differing environmental \ntemperatures, whereas poikilothermic animals have a body temperature that is the same as their environment, and thus, their temperature varies with the environmental \ntemperature.  \nOsmoregulation is the process of controlling \nthe amount of water and electrolytes by the \nhelp of osmoreceptors in order to retain \nhomeostasis.

Steeping \nSteeping is the process of cleaning the grain \nkernels and bringing it to life with water and oxygen by immersing it in the water and air for a specified time period. The water \nactivates naturally the existing enzymes in \ngrains and stimulates the production of enzymes in which water temperature and aeration are vital for producing high quality malt. Although the process can vary \ndepending on the grain type and size, malting \noccurs over a period of 24 –48 hours.  \nThe steeping  will be complete when the \nbarley has reached a sufficient moisture level \nto allow a uniform breakdown of starches and proteins. So starch and protein hydrolyzing \nenzymes are activated during steeping \n2. Germinating \nGerminating is to continue the process with \nthe growth and modification of the grain. \nRootlets emerge from the kernel to the outside of the grain and within the outer husk \nand a shoot or acrospires grows.  \nModification is the breakdown of protein and \ncarbohydrates, resulting in the opening up of \nthe s eeds’ starch reserves within four to six \ndays as Green Malt . The control of temperature and moisture levels with \nregulated airflow and the uniformity of water \nspray enables achieve a high quality and \nconsistent germination process.  \nMalting is partly an art and partly a science \nthat can be gauged in the degree of \nmodification with the eyes, sense of smell and \nhands.  \n3. Kilning (Heating) \nKilning is the heating treatment of germinated \ngrain  to dry the green malt and prevent from further germination. If germination continued, \nthe kernel would keep growing and the \ngrowing plant would use all of the starch reserves needed by the brewer. Removing moisture from the germinated grain is initially \nfor withering . Additional drying further \nreduces the moisture content and prepares \nthe malt for flavor and color development. The kilning process achieves enzymatic \nactivity and friability, a  wide ranges of malt \ncolors and flavors and distinctive ales and \nlagers. \n3.10.2  Why is malting for?  \nMalting aims to convert or modify the physical \nstructure of the barley grain and allow \nsynthesis or activation of a series of enzymes \nto produce malt for uses in the subsequent \npurposes (brewing, distilling or food \nproduction). \nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                                  FDRE-MoE ETHIOPIA  101"

DNA has a unique property of replication \nor production of carbon copies. This is essential for transfer of genetic information from one cell to \nits daughters and from one generation to the next. DNA gives rise to RNAs through the process of \ntranscription.  \nDNA replication is a semiconservative, which means that each strand in the DNA double helix \nacts as a template for the synthesis of a new, complementary strand. In other words, the two \noriginal DNA strands separate during replication; each strand then serves as a template for a new DNA strand. Each newly synthesized double helix is a combination of one old and one new DNA \nstrand (Figure 4.6).

The three stages of interphase are called G 1 (first gap stage), S (synthesis \nstage), and G 2 (second gap stage). \nThe G1 Phase (First Gap) \nG1 phase (first gap) is the first stage of interphase in which the cell is quite active at the \nbiochemical level. At G 1phase, the cell accumulates the building blocks of chromosomal DNA and \nthe associated proteins as well as sufficient energy reserves to complete the task of replicating each \nchromosome in the nucleus. The G0 phase (resting phase), is a phase in which the cell is neither \ndividing nor preparing to divide but performs regulatory and basic cellular functions. \nThe S Phase (Synthesis of DNA) \nThe S phase is a stage in which DNA replication proceeds to form identical pairs of DNA molecules \n(sister chromatids) that are firmly attached to the centromeric region. In this phase, the \ncentrosome duplicates and centrcoles develops to help organize cell division.  \nG2 Phase (Second Gap) \nThe G 2 phase is a stage in which, the cell replenishes its energy stores that exhausted during DNA \nreplication at S-phase and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation. In this \nphase, some cell organelles duplicate and the cytoskeleton disintegrates to provide resources for \nthe mitotic phase. The cell performs the final preparations for the mitotic phase to enter the first \nstage of mitosis. After completing the interphase, the cell undergoes either mitotic or meiotic cell \ndivisions. \nI.Mitosis \nMitosis is a basic process for life. Mitosis is the \ndivision of somatic cells.

Mendel performed seven types of \nmonohybrid crosses, each involving contrasting \ntraits for different characteristics.  \nMendel first conducted a self-cross, that is, tall with \ntall, dwarf with dwarf, violet with violet, etc., to verify the purity of plants in which a tall plant produces only tall offspring in successive crosses, and a dwarf plant produces only dwarf plants. He \ndid the same self-cross for all the traits (14 traits). He found that the seven pea plant characteristics \nwere consistent in generation after generation of self-fertilization, and they were considered pure \nlines/true lines.  \nThen, he began his experiments using purebred lines for contrasting characters. He cross-pollinated \ntwo pure lines for contrasting characters and the resultant offspring were called the F1 generation \n(also called the first filial generation). In this generation, one of the traits was always seen in the \noffspring but not the other one. Why \nThe F1 generations were then self-pollinated \nwhich gave rise to the F2 generation (also \ncalled the second filial generation). In this generation, both traits were observed. Mendel counted the number of second-generation \n(F2) progeny with dominant or recessive traits \nand found a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive traits. This means when the F1 generation self-crossed, he observed that three of the \noffspring out of four were phenotypically the \nsame whereas one was different. He called the characters that appear in the F1 generation dominant  traits and those that appear for the first time in the F2 generation recessive\ntraits. He used \ncapital letters  to denote the dominant allele of a gene and small letters  for \nrecessive alleles of a gene. His cross can be easily shown through a Punnett Square.

It states that a diploid \norganism passes alleles for a trait randomly to its offspring, whereby the offspring receives one allele from each parent. In \nessence, the law states that copies of genes randomly separate or segregate during meiosis so that \neach gamete receives only one allele.  \nGregor Mendel crossed various pure lines of garden peas and observed that traits are inherited as \nalternate states of independent units of inheritance or genes (factors), and that these units come in pairs. Each unit of inheritance can have alternate states (alleles) that segregate at meiosis, during \nwhich each gamete receives only one allele. This is called the law of segregation. \nThe physical basis of Mendel’s law of segregation is the first division of meiosis in which the \nhomologous chromosomes with their different versions of each gene are segregated into daughter nuclei. As chromosomes separate into different gametes during meiosis, the two different alleles for \na particular gene also segregate so that each gamete acquires one of the two alleles as \nchromosomes separate into different gametes during meiosis (Figure 4.27).  \nFigure 4.27 Segregation of maternal and paternal alleles into separate gametes \nThe Law of Independent Assortment \nThe Law of independent assortment is the second Mendel’s \nlaw of heredity which states that genes do not influence each \nInquir y activity 4.16\nDiscuss the law of segregation with \nexamples based on the previous \nlesson on monohybrid cross.\nHow did Mendel discovered \nthe Law of segregation ? \nHow did Mendel discovered the \nLaw of independent assortment ? \nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                                  FDRE-MoE ETHIOPIA  137"

This indicates that every possible \ncombination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur. According to this law, the separate genes for separate traits are passed independently of one another from parents to the offspring. \nThe Law of independent assortment occurs in metaphase I of meiosis when pairs of chromosomes \nrandomly align next at the center.  \nFor example, in the dihybrid cross with characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea \nplants, the one that has yellow, round seeds (YYRR) and another that has green, wrinkled seeds \n(yyrr) alleles sort into gametes independently and every possible combination of alleles for every \ngene is equally likely to occur (Figure 4.28).  \nThe genotype of the F\n1 generation of all offspring is YyRr. In the F2 generation, according to the \nlaw of independent assortment, a gamete in which an r allele sorted would be equally likely to \ncontain either a Y allele or a y allele. Here the chances of formation of gametes with the R allele \nand the r allele are 50:50. The chances of formation of gametes with the Y allele and the y allele are also 50:50. Thus, each gamete should have either R or r and Y or y. The Law of Independent \nAssortment states that the segregation of R and r is independent of the segregation of Y and y. \nHence, four equally likely gametes (YR, Yr, yR, and yr) can be formed when the YyRr heterozygote \nis self-crossed (see also the previous dihybrid cross}. \nFigure 4.28 Independent assortment of alleles during gametes formation \n4.5.4  Test Crosses \nAnother cross that was introduced by Gregor Mendel is a \ntestcross.

Accordingly, several different patterns of inheritance have been revealed.. The non-\nMendelian Inheritance is a form of genetic Inheritance that is not in accordance with M endel’s law. \nTherefore, Non- Mendelian genetics are, therefore, any inheritance patterns that don’t follow one or \nmore laws of the Mendelian genetics.  \nGregor Mendel explained that gene might  exist indifferent forms (alleles) that are either dominant \nor recessive.  However, there are other conditions in which alleles show different dominance relationships (e.g. Co-dominance and Incomplete dominance) and modes of inheritance (Gene \nlinkage and multiple allelism). These are examples of non-Mendelian inheritance.  \nAfter the successful completion o f this \nsection, the student will be able to:\nDefine non -Mendelian inheritance. \nDifferentiate between dominance, \nincomplete dominance and co -\ndominance. \nDescribe  ABO blood groups. \nExplain inheritance of blood group. \nDescribe blood transfusion. \nExplain Rh blood group and inheritance\nDescribe sex -linked inheritance.\nMention environmental factors that \naffect the phenotype of organisms.\nSelf-questioning\nBefore starting this section, \nask yourself this question: \n“What do I know about Non -\nMendelian inheritance and \nwhat do I want to learn from this section?”\nWhat is the difference between \nMendelian and non -Mendelian \ninheritance?\nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                        MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, ETHIOPIA 142"

To treat these disorders, genetic testing is important \nto identify the type of the disorder.  Genetic \ncounseling is also important because diseases caused by genetic disorders are complicated and may have different psychological and \nsocial impacts.  \nAs we have discussed in the above sections, \nthere are different diseases that are cause d \nby genetic disorders. To mention some of them diabetes, cancer, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease, muscular dystrophy, \nepilepsy and albinism are the most common \nones.  Genetic testing examines the genetic material \nand tells an individual about the likelihood and \nrisk of passing genetic disorders on to \nchildren. It identifies the likelihood of parents who pass a genetic disease or disorder to their children. Genetic testing examines if \nthere are any change in our DNA that can \ninform us the well-being of our health of us and our family. For instance, a woman may have diagnostic tests as part of her pregnancy \ncheckups and scansto find out if her baby has \na genetic disorder or not. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are examples of \ndiagnostic tests to be taken during pregnancy.  \nGenetic counseling is the process of checking \na family with regard to the medical history and medical records, ordering genetic tests, evaluating the results of these tests and \nrecording, and helping parents understand \nand reach decisions about what to do next.

It has been used to improve the quality of nutrition in products for humans and \nanimals. The goals of plant breeding are to produce crop varieties that boast unique and superior traits for a variety of agricultural applications. The most frequently addressed traits are those related to biotic and abiotic stress tolerance (resistance against drought, high temperature, salinity, \nflooding, and insect pest infestation).  Plant breeding is also applied to improve grain or biomass \nyield, end-use quality characteristics such as taste or the concentrations of specific biological molecules (proteins, sugars, lipids, vitamins, fibers) and ease of processing (harvesting, milling, \nbaking, malting, blending, etc).  \nPlant breeding can be carried out through many different techniques ranging from simply  selecting \nplants with desirable characteristics for propagation, to utilizing methods that make use of knowledge of genetics and chromosomes, to more complex molecular techniques. Some of them \nare mass selection, pure line selection and bulk selection.  \nMass selection method: In mass selection, a large number of plants of similar phenotype \nare selected and their seeds are mixed together to constitute the new variety. Mass selection is \nthe simplest form of plant breeding that was practiced in agriculture by early humans. \nPure line selection: In this method, a large number of plants are selected from self-\npollinated crops and are harvested individually by which individual plant progenies from them are evaluated and best progeny is released as pureline variety\nBulk method : In this, F2 and the subsequent generations are harvested in mass or as bulk to \nraise the next generation.

There are \ntwo types of cell divisions: mitosis and \nmeiosis. Mitosis is the division of somatic cells to produce two new, identical daughter cells at the end of series of steps. Meiosis is the division of sex cells.  It occurs in two phases: \nmeiosis I and Meiosis II and at the end \nproduces four different daughter cells with haploid number of chromosomes due to crossing over or genetic recombination and \nreduction of chromosome numbers. \nProtein synthesis is the process of making \nproteins from amino acids through the process of Transcription and Translation.

When both alleles are \nexpressed equally rather than a dominant \nallele taking complete control over a recessive allele, it is called co-dominance, whereas when an intermediate phenotype results in heterozygote, it is called incomplete \ndominance. Sex-linked is a trait influenced by \ngenes located on the sex chromosomes, mainly X chromosome because  an X chromosome is large and contains many more \ngenes than the smaller Y chromosome. The \nphenotype of an organism can also be determined by environmental factors. An example is phenocopy, an environmentally \ninduced phenotype of an individual. \nA pedigree shows how a gene that passes on \nfrom one generation to the next generation in a family determines the characteristics or \ngenetically determined diseases in humans.  It \ncan also show whether a trait is an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked \ntrait.  \nA genetic disorder is a disease that is caused \nby a change or mutation in the body cells of an individual’s DNA that passes on from parents to their children. It can be single gene \ndisorders (autosomal dominant, autosomal \nrecessive, x-linked), chromosomal or  multifactorial disorders, which indicate that genetic testing and counseling is important. Genetic testing examines the presence of \ndisorders on genetic materials and tells an \nindividual about the likelihood and risk of passing genetic disorders on to their children, whereas genetic counseling involves checking \nthe medical history and records of a family to \norder to conduct genetic tests.

It is \nalso normal for erections to occur during sleep and upon waking. An erection occurs when there is an increased flow of blood into the corpus cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. During an erection, \narteries supplying the erectile tissues will dilate (widen), causing the penis to engorge (fill) with \nblood. The engorgement compresses the veins through which blood usually exits the penis. This \n\"traps\" the blood and helps sustain the erection. \n2.

The difference in the duration is \nassociated with decreased fertility. \nEvents of the menstrual cycles are phases of follicular, ovulation, luteal and menstruation. Phases \n(events) of menstrual cycles are:\nThe follicular phase: is the event when the anterior pituitary produces and secret \nestrogens called follicles stimul ated hormones (FSH) that inhibit the secretion of \nnegative feedback to prevent the growth of other follicles. \nThe ovulation phase: an event when ovulation takes place in the midway through the \ncycle (days 12- 14) and estrogen stimulates the anterior pituit ary to secret luteinizing\nhormones (LH) as positive feedbacks to surge the release of an egg (secondary \noocyte) as ovulation.  \nThe Luteal phase: rupture follicle develops into a slowly degenerating corpus luteum \nto secret high levels of progesterone  and lower levels of estrogen .  Both estrogen \nand progesterone act on the uterus to thicken the endometrial lining in preparation for \npregnancy and inhibit the secretion of FSH and LH to prevent any follicle from developing. \n\nThe Menstruation phase: in the menstrual cycle, if fertilization occurs, the embryo \ndevelops, implants in the endometrium and release hormones to sustain the corpus luteum. If fertilization fails, the corpus luteum degenerates, estrogen and progesterone levels drop and forms corpus albinos after two weeks. The endometrium is not maintained longer and its layer is eliminated from the body as menstrual blood  or \nperiod (Figure 5.12).  \nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                                  FDRE-MoE ETHIOPIA  193"

The “ positive feedback” is the process in \nwhich the end products of an action cause more of that action to occur in a feedback loop . In a \nmenstrual cycle, it is a period ( days 12– 14) during when estrogen stimulates the hypothalamus of \nthe brain to release Gonadotropin Releasing Hormones (GnRH) that stimulates the an terior \npituitary gland to secrete Luteinizing Hormones (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormones \n(FSH). \nHormones are chemicals that coordinate different body functions by carrying messages through our \nblood to organs, muscles and other tissues.\n1.

In weeks \none to two of the cycle, the hormone stimulates the ovarian follicles to produce the female \nsex hormone estradiol.

The brain releases the hormone at the beginning of each cycle to stimulate \novaries to grow follicles and eggs for ovulation. The p rogesterone maintains the uterine lining or \nthickness of the uterus wall and lesser it for happening pregnancy. \nThe rise in FSH stimulates the growth of the follicle in the ovary, produces the increasing amounts of estradiol and reduces the release of gonadotrophin hormone as negative feedback . \nDuring each menstrual cycle, is a rise in FSH secretion in the first half of the cycle (follicular phase) \nstimulates follicular growth in the ovary l eading to ovulation. The ruptured follicle forms a corpus \nluteum that produces high levels of progesterone (luteal phase)  and at the end of the cycle, \nthecorpus luteum breaks down, progesterone production decreases and the next menstrual cycle \nbegins as follicle stimulating hormone levels start to rise again.\nIn negative feedbacks, the mechanism of biochemical pathway turns off, the egg fails of \nfertilization, the corpus luteum dies, progesterone levels drop and the uterine lining breaks \ndown and the woman is having a period or menstruation.

Fertilization \n Fertilization is the union of human egg and sperm cells in the \nampulla of the fallopian tube to produce a zygote (Figure 5.14). \nThe process of fertilization occurs when 23 sets of chromosomes \nfrom a spermatozoon and 23 sets of chromosomes from an egg \ncell fuse together. The fertilized egg (zygote) divides repeatedly as it moves down the fallopian tube \nto the uterus. About six days after fertilization, the embryo attaches to the lining of the uterus, usually near the top.

Use the description given \nbelow.\n The earth is home to diverse groups of \norganisms that are classified into different \necological organizations. Ecology is the study of the interaction between those diverse groups of organisms and the physical \nenvironment. The levels of ecological \norganization include individual, population, community, ecosystem, biosphere, and biome (refer grade, 9, unit 6). A population is a \ngroup of interacting individuals of the same species with common characteristics living \nand interbreeding within a given area. \nThe study of populations involves examining \nhow individuals in a particular population interact with each other and how the population as a whole interacts with its \nenvironment. The branch of biology that deals \nwith this concept is called ecology. \nPopulation ecology  is the study of the \nprocesses of interaction and changes that \naffect the distribution and abundance of populations in the environment. In studying population ecology, scientists use statistical measures (demographic parameters ) to help \nthem investigate how populations respond to \nchanges in their environments. The next \nsection deals with population size, density, \ndispersal, and population growth in brief. \n6.1.1 Population size, density \nand dispersal \nPopulation size \nPopulation size is the total number of \nindividuals present in a particular habitat \nwhere it is designated by the capital letter \n“N”. Fo r instance, a population of rats might \nconsist of 1000 individual rats or many more.  \nIn studying populations, locating and counting \neach individual is very difficult.

After some time, they came back and captured another 100 birds. Of the birds that were \ncaptured for the second time, they found that 20 were already marked and 80 were \nunmarked. Using this data, they can estimate \npopulation size as follows: \nGiven: M = 60; n = 100; X = 20 \n           \n            \n Population size has an effect on the survival \nof the population.

Moreover, a large population has an advantage over a small population in surviving \ndue to adaption in natural selection and changes in the physical environment, \ndiseases, predators, and competitors. \nStudying the human population  \nThe human population can be studied using a \ncensus.

There are two ways of describing population growth. These are \nlogistic growth and exponential growth.  \n6.1.2 Exponential and logistic growth in populations \nThe population size changes overtime. Accordingly, \npopulation ecology studies the changes  that happen to \ngroups of organisms and how those changes affect their \nconstant interactions with their environment. Population \ngrowth rate  is the percentage rate of change within a \nspecified number of individuals in a population. It is the \naverage annual rate of change of population size during a \nspecified period. It measures how fast the size of the \npopulation is changing. \nScientists use different methods and models \nto describe changes that occur in a population \nthereby predict future changes. The two \nmodels are: \nExponential growth model\ndescribes populations increase in \nnumbers without any limits to their \ngrowth.  \nLogistic growth model  describes \npopulations’ increases in number in \nthe presence of limits, and due to an \nincrease in number. \nExponential growth model \nExponential growth model represents the \ngrowth of a population  without  environmental \nconstraints in which the population size (N) \nincreases exponentially (Figure 6.3). In other words, it shows the growth of a population in \nan ideal environment with unlimited resources \nto use. The population growth graph of this \nmodel shows a \nJ-shaped curve (Figure 6.3). In determining population growth, it is \nimportant to consider the death and birth of \nthe organism. Thus, growth rate is \ndetermined by subtracting the death rate ( D)\nfrom the birth rate ( B). The death rate refers \nto the number of organisms that die during an \ninterval, whereas the birth rate refers to the \nnumber of organisms that are born during the same interval. Considering death and birth rate as single factor (r), growth rate can be \nexpressed in a simple equation as:  \n                         \n  \n   \nWhere dN/dT = growth rate of the population \nin a given instance, d = change, N = \npopulation size, t = time, and r = the per \ncapita  (per individual) rate of increase, that is, \nhow quickly the population grows per \nindividual  in the population (r = B – D). It is \nthe intrinsic rate of natural increase. \nInquiry activity 6.4 \nComparing population \ngrowth models\nBe in a group, dis cuss and \ncompare exponential and logistic \ngrowth models, and present \nyour answer to the class.

Exponential growth is difficult to \nsustain over a long period for any population because resources are limited in nature. Therefore, exponential growth cannot express this condition. Hence, there is a necessity for another type of \ngrowth model. Accordingly, to express the reality of limited resources, population ecologists \ndeveloped another growth model called the logistic growth  model (Figure 6.4).  \nIn the logistic growth model, the population growth levels off from exponential growth due to \nlimited resources, resulting in \nS-shaped curve  graph models of population growth instead of J-\nshaped curve  growth rate. The maximum population size that the available resources in an \nenvironment can sustain/support is called carrying capacity (K). When the size of  the population \nreaches its carrying capacity, population growth levels off. Hence, the equation for the logistic \nmodel is: \n                         \n         \n  \nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                                  FDRE-MoE ETHIOPIA  239"

Look for a graph sheet or paper then draw a central axis/line in the middle. Create a scale for the \npercentages of the population at the bottom of the axis (scale should not exceed 0 –10 %).

The death /mortality rate is \nrelatively constant throughout the entire life span, and mortality is equally likely to occur at \nany age in the life span. An example of this \npattern of survivorship curve occurs in some \nbirds. \nType III : organisms produce many offspring \nbut provide them with little or no care.

They include \npredation, competition (interspecific and intraspecific), accumulation of waste, and diseases (Figure 6.5). Usually, the denser a population is, the greater its mortality rate will be. For example, during intraspecific and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of individuals will usually be lower, \nreducing the growth rate of their population.  \nIn addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its \npredators because they have more difficulty ensuring their food \nsource. The diseases in the area regulate population growth. \nFor instance, unlike in a sparsely packed population, \ncommunicable diseases spread quickly and increase mortality in \na dense population.  \nB.Density-independent factors \nDensity-independent factors are non-living (abiotic) factors that regulate the population growth rate \nregardless of population density. Other density-independent factors include weather, natural \ndisasters, and pollution (Figure 6.9). An individual may be killed in a catastrophic earthquake \nregardless of the number of individuals present in that area.

Therefore, wise use and substitution of such natural resources is crucial to \npassing them on to the next generation. However, \ndue to the growing population, rapid industrialization, and urbanization, the demand for natural resources is rapidly increasing and they are excessively being \nused. This leads to the depletion of natural resources.  After the successful completion of this \nsection, the student will be able to:\nDefine conservation. \nExplain conservation mechanism of \nwildlife and plants. \nDiscuss the mechanisms of soil and water conservation.\nExplain the need for conservation. \nSelf-questioning\nBefore starting this section, ask yourself this \nquestion: “What do I know about conservation \nof natural resources and what do I want to \nlearn from this section?”\nInquiry activity 6.13 Studying \nconservation mechanisms\nBe in a group, v isit wild life \nconservation offices, the institute of \nbiodiversity, agricultural offices, water \nresource management and come up \nwith the conservation mechanisms \npracticed for wildlife, plants, soil, and \nwater in Ethiopia.\nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                        MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, ETHIOPIA 250"

It is also the preservation, management, or restoration of natural environments and the ecological communities habituated to human beings. Conservation aims to \nmanage human use of natural resources for the current public benefit and sustainable social and \neconomic utilization.  \nEthiopia has a wide range of natural resources such as plants, \nanimals, water, and soil. Its topography and diverse climatic \nconditions have contributed to the existence of such natural resources. However, natural resources are facing problems unless appropriate conservation mechanisms are designed and implemented to keep them and pass them on to the next \ngenerations. The next section deals with natural resources including, wildlife, plants, soil, and \nwater. \nWildlife in Ethiopia  \nhas huge wildlife resource potential that has national and \nglobal importance. Wildlife refers to living things that live in the natural environment and are not yet domesticated. This \nsection focuses on one of the categories of wildlife, animals. \nImportance:  Wildlife resources have different benefits in \nthat they are used to maintain natural ecological processes, \nstore genetic material for the future, secure wildlife tourism, \nand contribute to the national economy, and manufacture goods. Examples of wildlife in Ethiopia \nare shown in the figure below (Figure 6.11).  \nFigure 6.11 Examples of wild animals in Ethiopia.

Human activities such as expansion of agricultural activities,  development activities, deforestation, poaching, illegal wildlife trade, habitat change, climate change, overexploitation, and pollution have also contributed to the loss and \ndecline of wildlife in Ethiopia. How? \nConservation mechanisms : due to the gradual loss and decline of wild life, we found it very \ncrucial to design and implement wildlife conservation mechanisms. Wildlife conservation is the \npractice of protecting wildlife and their habitats. Wildlife conservation in Ethiopia has been practiced \nbased on wildlife conservation areas. For this purpose, Ethiopia has established 24 national parks, 2 wild sanctuaries, 6 wild life reserves, 5 community conservation areas and more than 10 controlled hunting areas, as shown in the table below (Table 6.1). The table shows the wildlife conservation areas, regional states in which they are located, year of establishment and area in hectares of each \nnational park, wild sanctuary, wild life reserve, community conservation area and controlled hunting \narea. \nTable 6.1 Sample National Parks, Sanctuaries, and Wildlife Reserves in Ethiopia \nArea State Year Hect.\nNational Parks\n1Abijata Shala Lakes Oromia 1963 88,700\n2Alatish Amhara 1997 266,600\n3Awash Oromia & Afar 1958 75,600\n4Bale Mountains Oromia 1962 247,100\n5Gambella Gambella 1966 506,100\n6Geralle Somali 1998 385,800\n7Kafta Shiraro7 Tigray 1999 250,000\n8Nechsar SNNP 1966 51,400\n9Omo SNNP 1959 406,800\n10Simien Mo untains Amhara 1959 41,200\n11Yangudi Rassa Afar 1969 473,100\n12Denkoro Chaka Amhara 1999 38,117\n13Mago SNNP 1984 194,200Activity 6.14 Exploring the causes of wild life decline\nWhat are the different natural and human activities that can be the causes of \nthe decline of wildlife in Ethiopia?

The natural disasters mentioned so far for the loss and decline of \nwildlife can be the major causes of the loss and decline of plant species. Human activities such as deforestation, climate change, invasive species, overexploitation, pollution and land degradation are some of the problems endangering plant species in Ethiopia. How these activities endanger plant \nspecies in Ethiopia?\nConservation mechanisms:  conservation mechanisms for plant species in Ethiopia include \nindigenous  and modern practices . \nIndigenous practices:  Indigenous or cultural practices refer to the long-standing traditions and \nways of life of specific communities or localities. Some of the traditional systems used for plant \nconservation rely on taboos or forbidden practices for using or consuming some plant species; domestication; reserves; selective harvesting; sacred groves, etc. Sacred places and places of worship, such as the compounds of churches and mosques, graveyards, and monasteries, have \nbeen important sites and are considered reserved areas that have contributed to the protection of \nindigenous plants.  \nThe traditional practices for preserving the genetic resources of indigenous vegetables are regarded \nas important conservation practices. The traditional farming systems and the traditional \nagroforestry systems practices have been able to maintain a rich genetic diversity of vegetables and \nother crops as the people who have used them have developed sophisticated mechanisms of \nselection, transfer, exchange, and conservation. \nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                        MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, ETHIOPIA 254"

Developing countries, including Ethiopia, have accounted for a large number of global road traffic deaths. In addition to the loss of a \nhuman being, car accidents have also been \nthe major cause of death for both wild and domestic animals (Figure 6.10). Even those animals that live in the conservation areas \nand outside are affected by car accidents \nwhile crossing highways near the reserved \nareas.  \nStudies in the field of road ecology suggest \nthat car accidents are the major cause of \nreductions in wildlife populations. This holds true in Ethiopia, where many animals are killed every year due to car accidents. For instance, a study conducted in 2017 by Addisu Asefa and his colleagues in Geralle \nNational Park indicated that 29% of the \nwildlife mortality was due to car accidents. Imagine how this mortality would be high in other national parks and other wider areas \nwhere there are a number of crossing roads. \nSome of the methods to reduce traffic \naccidents on both wildlife and domestic animals include designing structures that \nallow safe passage for animals and wildlife, \nconstructing underpasses to promote habitat connectivity and encourage natural movements, and considering natural wildlife \nhabitats when roads are constructed and \nderiving slowly.

It is also the addition of any substances and forms of \nenergy to the environment at a rate faster than they can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some \nharmless form.  \nCauses of environmental pollution:  Environmental pollution can be caused to some extent by \nnatural events such as forest fires and active volcanoes, but mainly by human activities. Rapid \nhuman population growth and industrialization have aggravated pollution, which has become a \nuniversal problem. \nTypes of environmental pollution:  The major types of pollution are air pollution, water \npollution, land pollution, noise pollution, and light pollution. Pollution of all kinds can have negative \neffects on the environment and wildlife that in turn have impacts on the health and wellbeing of \nhuman beings. \nAir Pollution and its Effects \nAir pollution is the contamination of the air in the atmosphere by \nharmful gases, dust, and smoke that affect plants, animals, and \nhumans drastically.  \nHow air pollution \naffects living things? \nWhat is pollution?

These pollutants are released from human activities such as transportation, industrial \nactivities, the burning of coal and natural gas, the use of refrigerants and the use of various volatile chemicals. The following figure shows examples of air pollution causes (Figure 6.15). What do you \nthink is the source effects on air? \nFigure 6.15 Causes of air pollution: industrial smoke (left), solid waste (right) \nEffects of air pollution:  Air pollution is the leading environmental health risk and a major cause \nof environmental degradation in the world. It is the major cause of the depletion of the ozone layer \nand of many other harmful environmental effects. It causes respiratory and cardiovascular disorders in human beings, changes the pH levels of the soil, causes acidic rain and infects plants and other \nforms of vegetation, thereby making the food we eat harmful and toxic. \nWater Pollution and its effect \nWater is essential for living things. Water pollution is the contamination of \nwater bodies. It interferes with the beneficial use of water. For instance, \nthe presence of an excessive number of toxins in water bodies causes \npollution of water. \nCauses of water pollution:  The major causes of water pollution are usually human activities. \nMany pollutants into water are released from human activities such as factories, industrial \nagricultural wastes, sewage, transportation of oil, use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides, \nherbicides, pathogenic microorganisms, and \nWater hyacinth  (Emboch) (Figure 6.16).  \nEffects of water pollution:  Water pollution is the major cause of the depletion of fish \npopulations, the destruction of biodiversity, and waterborne diseases that lead to death. \nHow water pollution \naffect living things? \nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                                  FDRE-MoE ETHIOPIA  261"

Climate change is a change in the usual patterns of weather. This could be a \nchange in the amount of rain, temperature, \netc., for a month or season. Thus, climate change can affect living organisms in the \nenvironment.  \nCause of climate change:  Global climate \nchanges naturally over time scales due to the \nnatural variations from internal fluctuations \nsuch as exchange of energy, water and \ncarbon between the atmosphere, oceans, land and ice, and from external influences such as \nvariations in the energy received from the sun \nand the effects of volcanic eruptions.  \nHuman activities can also change the climate \nby changing the natural components of the \nenvironment. Human activities, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, are altering the climate system. It has increased the levels of \ncarbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in \nthe atmosphere. Many of these greenhouse gases occur naturally, but human activities are increasing the concentrations of some of them in the atmosphere, in particular carbon \ndioxide (CO\n2), methane, nitrous oxide, and \nfluorinated gases. \nWhat is climate change? \nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                        MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, ETHIOPIA 262"

Ozone (O 3) is \nmade of three oxygen atoms. While oxygen is important for the \nlife of organisms, ozone is a toxic gas. However, ozone plays a \ncritical function in the various ambient layers of the \natmosphere. The atmosphere has four layers. These are the troposphere, stratosphere, \nmesosphere, and thermosphere.  \nOzone is found in the stratosphere of the atmosphere (Figure 6.20). The sun releases UV rays onto \nthe earth, where the rays harm animals by causing skin cancer in humans. The ozone layer protects the earth from these harmful radiations (UV rays). It absorbs the radiation from the sun, thereby \npreventing it from entering the earth’s atmosphere. However, this protective layer has been eroding \ndue to the various factors resulting in ozone depletion (ozone hole). \nCause of ozone depletion:  The major cause of ozone layer depletion is the release of CFCs \n(chlorofluorocarbons), which are used in refrigerators and fire extinguishers, hydrofluorocarbons \n(HCFCs), and halons. CFCs cause chemical reactions that break down ozone molecules, reducing \nthe ozone's ultraviolet radiation-absorbing capacity. Chlorine reacts with ozone and forms oxygen \n(O\n2) and chlorine monoxide (ClO). \nWhen the molecule of chlorine monoxide (ClO) meets with another molecule of oxygen(O), it breaks \nup, releasing chlorine (Cl), which can react with another molecule of ozone (O 3), creating the \ncatalytic cycle of chlorine.  \nCl + O 3 ClO + O 2\n ClO + O\nWhat is the ozone layer?

It is caused by high concentrations of acid-forming pollutants that dissolve in \nfreshly condensed water vapor in the atmosphere. The major causes of acid rain are the burning of \nfossil fuels, electric power-generating facilities, industrial processes, exhausts emitted from the \ninternal combustion engines that serve as sources of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, etc. \nThe burning of fossil fuels (coal or oil) for energy contains sulfur and nitrogen, which combine with \noxygen to form sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide, which contribute to the acidity of rain. \nSulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides enter into the atmosphere and react with water to form solutions of sulfuric acid (H\n2SO4), and nitric acid (HNO 3) respectively (figure 6.19). The reactions are shown \nas follows: \n2SO 2 (g) + O 2(g) + 2H 2O (l) → 2H 2SO4(aq) \n4NO 2(g) + O 2(g) + 2H 2O (l) → 4HNO 3(aq)\nMoreover, carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the atmosphere makes rain slightly acidic. This is because carbon \ndioxide and water combine to form carbonic acid, commonly known as carbonated water.  \nFigure.6.19 formation of acid rain \nEffects of acid rain: Acid rain causes great damage to plants, soil, and water that in turn affects \nmany living organisms that depend on these resources for their survival. Acid rain can harm plants \nby damaging the outer leaf surfaces by stripping away the waxy protective coating from the plant \nleaves, resulting in the leaching of nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium out of leaf \ntissue and drying (Figure 6.20).\nHow the rain becomes \nacidic? \nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                                  FDRE-MoE ETHIOPIA  267"

PBTs are typically accumulated in fatty tissues and are slowly metabolized, often \nincreasing in concentration within the food chain.  \nSources of toxic bio-accumulates:  The major bio-accumulates are organic compounds and \nmetals. They include synthetic chemicals that contain halogen atoms (particularly fluorine, chlorine, \nor bromine), DDT, and metals, such as lead and mercury.  \nThe process of bioaccumulation occurs as follows (Figure 6.22): \n1.Plants absorb small amounts of toxic substances, often pesticides or pollutants. \n2.These plants are eaten by primary consumers in low concentrations. \n3.The toxin cannot be excreted, so when the primary consumers are eaten by secondary \nconsumers, the toxin is absorbed by secondary consumers. \n4.This repeats as secondary consumers are eaten by higher-level consumers. \n5.At each trophic level of the food chain, the toxins remain in the tissues of the animals, so \nthe concentration of toxins becomes the most concentrated in the body tissues of the \nanimals at the top of the food chain. \nEffects of toxic bio-accumulates : Unlike many chemicals in the environment, bio-accumulates \nare not degraded by sunlight, destroyed through reactions with other environmental substances, or metabolized by naturally occurring bacteria. They are also resistant to the metabolic reactions in \npeople or wildlife. Humans, domestic animals, and wildlife are more likely to be exposed to these \nchemicals in the environment.  \nBio-accumulative chemicals can have a variety of toxic properties, resulting in a diverse array of \nadverse health effects such as mutagenic damage to DNA, cancer, neurological toxicity, \nreproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, and immune system damage.  \nLead contamination of air, soil, or drinking water can ultimately result in significant exposures in \nfetuses, infants, and children, resulting in impaired brain development.

The people of Ethiopia have indigenous knowledge about \nnatural phenomena, natural resources, and their environment. For \ninstance, they have indigenous knowledge of natural phenomena such as astronomy, the proper \nuse of natural resources, including the conservation and the prediction of seasonal conditions such as rainy season, drought season, weather conditions, productivity of the season, etc. This indigenous knowledge was developed through the critical observation of the sun, moon, and stars; \nbehavior of animals; winds; and the level of temperatures.  \nThe indigenous knowledge they have developed has helped them to have their own calendar, \npredict the weather conditions, treat different types of diseases, produce crops to sustain their lives, \nprotect their environment and conserve natural resources.  \nPeoples in Ethiopia have developed indigenous knowledge in a wide range of fields of conservation \nof natural resources, such as the conservation of soil, water, crop seeds (selection and preservation), forest, medicinal plants, animals, etc. For example, the well-known and \ninternationally recognized indigenous soil and water conservation practice of the Konso People, \nsouthwestern Ethiopia (practiced for more than 400 years) and this practice, which was registered by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a world heritage, can be mentioned.

The quadrat and mark-recapture methods are commonly used in \npopulation studies. Individuals in an area \nshow dispersal patterns,  which refer to the \ndistribution of individuals in space at a given time. They may have \nuniform dispersion, \nrandom dispersion, or clumped dispersion.\nThe world’s human population, including the population of Ethiopia, has been growing faster and faster from time to time. This has \nresulted in various adverse effects in the \ntransformation of a considerable portion of natural ecosystems in order to accommodate and supply this population growth. The \nmagnitude of its impact on the environment \ndepends on the following factors: human population size, resource use, waste production, environmental degradation, and \ntechnological developments.  \nModels are used to study population ecology \nto describe the changes that occur in a population, thereby predicting future changes. \nThe exponential growth model describes \npopulations increasing in numbers without any limits to their growth, and the logistic growth model describes populations \nincreasing in number using limits due to an \nincrease in number. The population growth graph of the exponential growth model shows a \nJ-shaped curve,  whereas the logistic \ngrowth model shows an S-shaped curve\ngraph because of the carrying capacity bywhich population growth levels off. There are \ntwo causes, density-dependent factors \n(due to an increase in population \ndensity) and density-independent \nfactors (regardless of population density). \nDemography is the study of population \nchanges over time and focuses on population \nsize, population density, fecundity (birth rates), fertility, mortality (death rates) , \nmarriage, migration, age, and sex . \nDemographers use population pyramids to \nrepresent the age-sex structure of a \npopulation and states the complex social narrative of a population through their shape. A population pyramid is a graphical \nrepresentation of the age and sex composition \nof a specific population . \nNatural resources are substances or materials \nthat exist naturally in the environment and \nare used for different purposes. They include \noil, coal, natural gas, metals, stone, air, sunlight, soil, water, animals, birds, fish, and plants. These can be grouped as renewable \n(can be replaced after utilization) and non-\nrenewable natural resources (do not naturally replenish).As a result of an increase in the population, natural resources are depleting \nexcessively. Hence, conservation is very \nimportant. Conservation is the preservation, management, protection, and wise use of natural resources.

One of the impacts is climate \nchange due to the combustion of fossil fuels. \nThis activity has increased the levels of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the \natmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap the sun’s \nheat and prevent it from returning into space, resulting in global warming which has caused an increase in the temperature of the earth's \natmosphere, the ocean, and land surface. This \nhas resulted in the rise of sea levels, extinctions of species and loss of habitat, heavy rainfall and flooding, high heat stress \nand health risk. \nThe other effect of human activities is \nenvironmental pollution. Environmental pollution is the contamination of the \ncomponents of the environment. This \npollution has different impacts on the natural world. Some of the impacts that adversely affect human beings and other living things are global warming, acid rain, ozone depletion, loss of biodiversity, and \nbioaccumulation in the environment. The local \npeople are aware of the degradation and depletion of natural resources. They have accumulated their own indigenous knowledge \nto conserve natural resources. People in \nEthiopia have developed indigenous knowledge in the conservation of natural resources such as soil, water, crop seeds \n(selection and preservation) forest, medicinal \nplants, animals, etc. The practice of the Konso people in Ethiopia can be taken as exemplary indigenous knowledge used for the \nconservation of natural resources.  \nBIOLOGY GRADE 11                                                                                                  FDRE-MoE ETHIOPIA  279"
