It helps us to understand every\nliving organism, from the _ smallest\nbacteria to the blue whales. Biologists\noften focus on a different subset of living\nsuch as_ birds,\n\norganisms, plants, or\n\nbacteria, to determine their character.\n\nBiological science is very useful science\nto determine where some diseases and\npests come from, such as infections,\nanimal pathologies, and damage to plants.\nBiology covers the study of the functions\nof living organisms, the evolution of\nspecies, the factors that produce diseases,\n\nas well as the discovery of new drugs.\n\nThis discipline allows human beings to\n\nexplore topics such as __ genetic\nengineering, research applications with\nmother cells, and global warming. It also\n\nhelps to understand nature and how\n\nBiology Grade 12 7\n\nUnit 1: Applications of Biolog\n\nhumans, animals, and plants interact in\n\nlife.\n\nBiology offers a vision of how living\nthings evolve. Understanding the rates of\nextinction and how a species depends on\nand affects the habitat where it lives\nimproves the effectiveness of\n\nconservation efforts.\n\nA practical application of biology with\nwhich most people are familiar is hand\nwashing, domestication, and traditional\nfermentation. Regular soap washing\nremoves acquired microbes from the skin\nand helps control the spread of infectious\n\ndiseases.\n\nIn addition, another application of biology\nis the set of instructions given to take all\nthe pills of antibiotics in a recipe.

This is commonly\ndone by heating the plant material and\ntreating it with acid, which is both expensive\nand corrosive. Work to harvest cellulase- and\nhemicellulase-producing fungi as well as\nbioprospecting for enzymes from\nthermoacidophiles are ongoing in an effort to\nreplace the harsh thermochemical approach\n\nwith a biological treatment.\n\nE).

Insect-resistant crops\n\nAnother important agricultural development\nis that of genetically modifed plants\nprotected against attack by insect pests.\nMaize is protected against the corn borer,\nwhich eats the leaves of the plants and then\nburrows into the stalk, eating its way\nupwards until the plant cannot support the\near. Cotton is protected against pests such\nas the boll weevil (Figure 1.13). In both\n\nplants, yield is improved.\n\nInsect-resistant tobacco also exists, and is\nprotected against the tobacco bud worm,\nbut as yet it has not been grown\ncommercially. The most likely detrimental\neffects on the environment of growing an\ninsect-resistant crop are:\n\n> The evolution of resistance by the insect\n\npests\n\n> a damaging erect on other species of\ninsects\n\n> the transfer of the added gene to other\nspecies of plant.\n\nHowever, less pesticide is used, reducing\nthe risk of spray carrying to and erecting\nnon-target species of insects in other areas.\nRemember also that only insects that\nactually\n\neat the crop are a erected.\n\nFigure 1.16. a).

The microorganisms include bacteria,\nfungi, algae, protozoa, viruses. Microorganisms help in organic matter decomposition, humus\n\nformation.\n\nThe important role of microorganisms includes nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization,\npotassium mobilization, antagonism towards pathogens, pests. Hence, the role of\n\nmicroorganisms in agriculture is indispensable (Figure 2.32).\n\nThe chemical elements carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus are essential for life\nand abundant, but not necessarily in forms that organisms can use.

As defined,\nmicrobial bioremediation makes use of\n\nmicroorganisms and/or their derivatives\n(enzymes or spent biomass) to clean-up\n\nenvironmental contaminants.\n\nIt is important to note that microorganisms\n\nare everywhere and as such pollutants in the\n\ndifferent environmental compartments\nalways come into contact with\nmicroorganisms. Microbes break\n\ndown/transform pollutants via their inherent\nmetabolic processes with or without slight\npathway modifications to allow the pollutant\nto be channeled into the normal microbial\nmetabolic\n\npathway for degradation/and\n\nbiotransformation.\n\nApplied bioremediation methods therefore\nfocus on tapping the naturally occurring\nmicrobial catabolic capabilities to degrade,\ntransform or accumulate most of the\nsynthetic compounds such as hydrocarbons\n(e.g., oil), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),\n(PAHs),\n\npolyaromatic hydrocarbons\n\nradionuclides and metals.

The residues for the\ntreatment are usually harmless products\nincluding water, carbon dioxide and cell\n\nbiomass.\nFood production and processing\n\nThe tart taste of yogurt, pickles, sharp\ncheeses, and some sausages is due to the\nproduction of lactic acid by one or more\nmembers of a group of bacteria known as the\nlactic acid\nbacteria. These bacteria - including species\n(Figure 2.34) of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus,\nStreptococcus, Leuconostoc, and\nPediococcus are obligate fermenters that\ncharacteristically produce lactic acid as an\nend product of their metabolism.

It takes place\nin the stroma of the chloroplast. The dark\nreaction is purely enzymatic and it is slower\nthan the light reaction. Dark reaction does\nnot require light . In a dark reaction, the\nsugars are synthesized from CO». The\nenergy-poor CO is fixed to energy-rich\ncarbohydrates using the — energy-rich\ncompound, ATP, and the assimilatory power,\nNADPH)? of light reaction. The process is\n\ncalled carbon fixation or carbon assimilation.\n\nC3 Plants are plants capable of fixing CO2\n\ninto a 3-Carbon sugar called\nPhosphoglycerate (PGA). The energy from\nATP and NADPH energy carriers generated\nby the photosystems is used to phosphorylate\nthe PGA. In this process, carbon dioxide\nenters a plant through its stomata, and the\nenzyme Rubisco fixes carbon into sugar\nusing the Calvin cycle. This fixation of\ncarbon dioxide by Rubisco is the first step of\nthe Calvin cycle. The plants that use this\nmechanism of carbon fixation are called C3\nplants. Approximately 95% of plants on the\nearth are C3 plants. Some of the C3 plant\nexamples are wheat, rye, oats, and orchard\n\ngrass.\n\nThe photosynthesis process can take place\nonly when the stomata on leaves are open.\n\nC3 plants exhibit the C3 pathway. It is a\n\nthree-carbon compound (3-PGA). Here the\nfirst carbon compound produced has three\ncarbon atoms hence the name “C3\npathway’(Figure 3.7). The light-independent\nreactions of the Calvin cycle can be\norganized into three basic stages: fixation,\n\nreduction, and regeneration.\n\n1. Carbon fixation: A molecule of carbon\ndioxide is combined with a carbon acceptor\nmolecule containing five atoms known as\nribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). This step\ngives rise to a compound having six carbon\natoms that disintegrate into two molecules of\na compound containing three carbons called\n3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA). This\nreaction is catalyzed by the enzyme RuBP\n\ncarboxylase, or rubisco.\n\n2. Reduction: In the second stage of the\nCalvin cycle, ATP and NADPH molecules\nare utilized to change the 3-PGA molecules\ninto a sugar molecule containing three\ncarbon atoms called  glyceraldehyde-3-\nphosphate (G3P). This stage has derived its\nname from the fact that NADPH donates\nelectrons to a three-carbon intermediate to\n\nform G3P.\n\n3. Regeneration: Some G3P molecules form\nglucose, while others need to be recycled so\nthat they can regenerate the RuBP acceptor.\nRegeneration needs ATP and involves a\nof reactions called the\n\ncomplex series\n\n“carbohydrate scramble.”\n\n126|Page FDRE —MoE.

Cell body: The cell body contains the\nnucleus, as well as other organelles. Also\nknown as a soma, the cell body is the\nneuron’s core. The cell body consists of\nnucleus that carries genetic information,\n\nmaintains the neuron’s_ structure, and\nprovides energy to drive activities. Most of\nthe neurone cell bodies are located inside the\ncentral nervous system and form the grey\nmatter. The Cell bodies that are located in\nthe peripheral nervous system are called\n\nganglia.\n\n2). Axon: Each neurone has only one axon\nthat conducts information away from the cell\nbody. The axon will also branch at its\nterminal into many axon terminals. The axon\ndelivers the impulse to another neurone or a\ngland or a muscle. Individual axons are\ntermed nerve fibers, and collectively they\nform a nerve.\n\nMany axons are insulated\n\nwith a fatty substance called myelin sheath.\n\n240|Page FDRE —MoE. Ethiopia"

It gives you\n\nsenses of touch, temperature and pain.\nThe skin:\n\ne Contains a huge variety of sense organs\n\n(touch, temperature, pressure, pain).\n\ne Forms a waterproof layer around the\nbody tissues, which protects against the\nloss of water by evaporation and\nprevents gaining water by osmosis\n\nwhile swimming in the river or wash.\n\ne It protects the body from the entry of\n\nbacteria and other pathogens.\n\nIt protects the body from damage by\nUV light.\n\ne It is an excretory organ (nitrogenous\n\nwastes are lost with the sweat).\n\ne It is vital in controlling the body\n\ntemperature.\n\nBasic components of the human skin\n\nKeywords\n\nHypodermis the lower fatty layer of\n\nskin which helps to\ninsulate the body against heat loss\n\nDermis the middle layer of skin,\nwhich is made up of blood vessels,\nlymph vessels, hair follicles, and\n\nsweat glands\n\nThe human skin is the largest organ of the\nbody, with a total area of about 20 square\nfeet. The skin protects us from microbes\nand elements, helps regulate body\ntemperature, and permits the sensations of\ntouch, heat, and cold. Skin has three main\nlayers. These are epidermis, dermis and\n\nhypodermis.\n\nFDRE —MoE. Ethiopia"

The middle layer or\ndermis contains the blood vessels, the\nsweat glands, the sensory receptors and the\nhair follicles. This layer is closely involved\nin temperature control in homeostasis and\nin your sense of touch. The upper layer or\nepidermis is made up of dead cells.\nKeratinocytes, melanocytes and\nlangerhans cells are some of the important\ncells found in the epidermis.\nKeratinocytes- produce the protein known\nas keratin, the main component of the\nepidermis. Keratin makes up hair, nails,\nand the surface layer of the skin. Keratin is\nwhat forms the rigidity of your skin and\nhelps with the barrier protection that your\n\nskin offers.

In the dermis, there are\ncollagen and elastin proteins necessary for\nskin health because they offer support and\nelasticity (the skin’s ability to go back to\nits original state after being stretched).\nCollagen is the most plentiful protein in\nthe skin, making up 75-80% of the skin.\nCollagen and elastin are responsible for\nwarding off wrinkles and fine lines. Over\ntime, the environment and aging reduce\nthe body’s ability to produce collagen. It is\nthe dermis which is particularly involved\n\nin the homeostatic mechanisms of the skin.\n\nThe thickness of the epidermis and dermis\nmay vary. Due to variation in the thickness\nthe skin can be categorized as thick and\nthin. Thin skin covers most of the body\nand can vary in thinness, with the thinnest\nskin covering the eyelids. Thick skin is\npresent on the soles of the feet and palms\nof the hands. In addition to differing\nthicknesses, the skin also differs in what is\navailable in the layers. For example, thick\nskin has no hair follicles or sebaceous\n\nglands, whereas thin skin does.\n\nMinistry of Education"

The\nolfactory receptors in the nose help to\nidentify food, mates, predators, and provides\nboth sensual pleasure in the odor of flowers\nand perfume, as well as warnings of danger.\nFor example, spoiled food, fire or chemical\ndangers. For both humans and animals, it is\none of the important means by which the\nenvironment communicates with us. Another\nfunction of the nose is the conditioning of\ninhaled air, which the nose makes it more\nhumid and warmer. Hairs inside the nose\nprevent large particles from entering the\n\nlungs.\n\ne The nasal passages not only allow the\npassage of air for respiration through the\n\nnose but also warm and filter the air.\n\ne The nasal concha or turbinate bone is a\n\nlong, narrow and curled bone shelf that\n\nprotrudes into the breathing passage of\nthe nose. In humans, the turbinates divide\nthe nasal airway into four groove like air\npassages, and are responsible for forcing\ninhaled air to flow in a steady, regular\npattern around the largest possible\nsurface of cilia and climate controlling\n\ntissue.\nHow do you smell?\n\nSpecialized receptor cells of the olfactory\nepithelium detect and recognize smells. The\nair passes through the nasal cavity and\nthrough a thick layer of mucus to the\nolfactory bulb. The olfactory bulb is situated\nin the forebrain. The smells are recognized\nhere because each smell molecule fits into a\nnerve cell like a puzzle piece. The cells then\nsend signals to the brain via the olfactory\nnerve. The brain then interprets those\nmolecules as the sweet flowers, or the\ncurdling milk that you have held up to your\n\nnose.\n\n280|Page FDRE —MoE. Ethiopia"

They\n\nalso help shade the eyes from direct sunlight.\n\nThe eyelids (upper and lower) with their\nassociated lashes are two movable structures\ncomposed of skin and two types of muscle:\nstriated and smooth. Their purpose is to\nprotect the eye from foreign bodies and limit\nthe amount of light entering the eye. In\naddition, they serve to distribute tears that\nlubricate the surface of the eye (see Figure\n5.24). The eyelids join at two points: the\nlateral (outer) canthus and medial (inner)\ncanthus. The medial canthus contains the\npuncta, two small openings that allow\ndrainage of tears into the lacrimal system,\nand the caruncle, a small, fleshy mass that\n\ncontains sebaceous glands.\n\nThe white space between open eyelids is\ncalled the palpebral fissure. When closed, the\neyelids should touch. When open, the upper\n\nlid position should be between the upper\nmargin of the iris and the upper margin of\nthe pupil. Eyelashes are projections of stiff\nhair curving outward along the margins of\nthe eyelids that filter dust and dirt from air\n\nentering the eye.\n\nThe conjunctiva is a thin, transparent,\ncontinuous membrane that is divided into\ntwo portions: a palpebral and a_ bulbar\nportion.

These filter out dust particles\nfrom the air entering the ear canal. The cells\nlining the ear canal produce waxy material\nwhich traps dust and germs, and lubricates\n\nthe eardrum.\n\nBehind the eardrum is a cavity filled with air.\nThis cavity contains three tiny bones and\nforms the middle ear. The three tiny bones—\ncalled the malleus (hammer), the incus\n(anvil) and the stapes (stirrup) (see Figure\n5.31) are the smallest bones in the human\nbody. They form joints with one another,\nwith the malleus attached to the eardrum and\nthe stapes to the oval window. The cavity of\nthe middle ear is connected to the throat by a\ntube called the Eustachian tube. This is\nusually closed but when the pressure in the\nmiddle ear increases, the tube opens until the\nair pressure in the middle ear is equal to that\nin the throat and therefore to the atmosphere.\n\nAt one end of the middle ear, opposite to the\n\neardrum, there are two openings: one of them —\n\nis oval in shape and hence it is called the oval a\n\nwindow.

During\nthe day, the sun shines through the\natmosphere and warms the earth’s surface.\nAt night the earth's surface cools, releasing\nheat back into the air. During this time some\nof the heat is trapped by the greenhouse\ngases in the atmosphere and keeps the earth’s\ntemperature at an average 14°C (57°F). The\ngases act like glass walls of a greenhouse and\nhence the name, greenhouse gases.
