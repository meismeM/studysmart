Examples of \nphysical changes are  evaporation of liquids, powdering of sugar and melting of ice. The change which results in the formation of one or more  new substances with new chemical composition is known as  a chemical change.  Examples of chemical changes are turning of milk into curd, photosynthesis by green plants and rotting of egg by bacteria. Chemical changes  occur due to chemical reactions between substances. In general, a change is called a chemical reaction if it exhibits all or part of the following characteristics.i. Formation of new substancesii. Production of heat or light or bothiii. Change in coloriv. Change in temperature and etc. \nChemical reaction  is the process in which reacting substances, called reactants, are \nconverted into new substances, called products . The characteristics of the products are \ncompletely different from those of the reactants. \nFor example, if you burn sulphur with oxygen, the sulphur and oxygen are completely \nconverted to sulphur dioxide. Sulphur dioxide is a colourless gas with a pungent odour. These characteristics of sulphur dioxide are completely different from the characteristics of the original substances, sulphur and oxygen. A chemical reaction is \nrepresented by a short hand notation called chemical equation as:\nReactants   Products\nA chemical equation uses chemical symbols to show what happens during a chemical reaction.

As a result, the number of atoms of each element should remain the same before and after the reaction. To balance a chemical equation means to equalize the number of atoms on both sides of the equation by putting appropriate coefficients in front of the formulas.\nA. Balancing Chemical Equations by Inspection Method \nThe most common way to balance chemical equations is to use inspection method. It is exactly what the name states. You balance the equation by inspecting it.  It is also known as a trial and error method or a hit and trial method.Follow four easy steps, given below, to balance a chemical equation by inspection method:1. Write the word equation. 2.Write the correct symbols or formulas for the reactants and products (unbalanced equation).\n3.Start with the most complicated compound count and tabulate the number of each type of atoms on the two sides of the unbalanced equation.\n4.Make the number of each type of atoms on the left side equal to the number of corresponding atoms on the right side of the equation.\nExample 1.3 : Balance the chemical reaction that takes place between iron and \nwater to form  iron (IV)  oxide and hydrogen gas by the inspection method.\nStep 1 :  Iron + Water → Iron (IV) oxide + Hydrogen (word equation)\nStep 2 :  Fe + H2O  →  Fe3O4 + H2 (Unbalanced equation)\nLet us count and tabulate the number of various types of atoms on the reactant \nand product sides  of the expression\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4  +  H2\nAtom Reactant side Product side Equation\nNumber of Fe atoms 1 3\nNumber of  O atoms 1 4\nNumber of  H atoms 2 2\nTotal no. of  atoms 4 9 Unbalanced"

Balancing Chemical Equations Using Algebraic Method\nThis method of balancing chemical equations involves assigning algebraic variablesas stoichiometric coefficients to each species in the unbalanced chemical equation.These variables are used in mathematical equations and are solved to obtain the values of each stoichiometric coefficient. Consider the formation of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen as an example.Step 1: Write the unbalanced equation with the correct symbols of the reactants & products:\n  N\n2 + H2→ NH3 (unbalanced equation)\nStep 2: Assign algebraic variables to each species as coefficients (a, b, c) in the \nunbalanced equation:\naN2 + bH2→ cNH3\nThen, set equations for each element so that it is equal in both the right and left handside.\nN: 2a = c (subscript of N is 2 in the left side and 1 in the right side)\nH: 2b = 3c (subscript of H is 2 in the left side and 3 in the right side)\nStep 3: Choose the smallest variable and assign arbitrary number in order to determine \nthe remaining variables.\nIn the above case, a is the smallest c oefficient. Assuming a = 1, the values of b and c \ncan be obtained as follows. c = 2 x 1= 2, 2b = 3c = 3 x 2 = 6; b = 6/2 = 3\nSince a, b, and c have no common multiples, they can be substituted into the equationas follows.\nN\n2 + 3H2→ 2NH3 ( balanced equation)\nExample 1.4: Balance the reaction: Al + O2→ Al2O3 using the algebraic method.\nAssign variables for each element\n  aAl + bO2→ cAl2O3\nThe equation for Aluminum: a = 2c (subscript of Al is 2 in the left side and 2 in the right side).

Decomposition ReactionsA decomposition reaction (or analysis) is a reaction that involves the breaking down of a single compound into two or more elements or simpler compounds. A decomposition reaction can be carried out using heat (thermal decomposition), light (photo decomposition), electricity (electrical decomposition) or a catalyst. But most decomposition reactions are carried out when heat is supplied and this heat energy is indicated by a ‘delta’ (Δ) symbol above the arrow. The general form of equation for a decomposition reaction is:\n  AB → A + B\nwhere the reactant AB must be a compound and the products A and B could be \nelements or compounds.\nThe simplest kind of decomposition reaction is when a binary compound decomposes \ninto its elements.

All such types of processes or reactions are known as oxidation and reduction or redox reactions. Additionally, most metallic and nonmetallic elements are obtained from their ores by the process of oxidation or reduction. What are oxidation and reduction reactions?\nOxidation-Reduction\nAn oxidation is defined as the loss of one or more electrons by an atom, and a reduction \nis the gain of one or more electrons. Oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously.  \nThus, an oxidation reduction reaction, or redox reaction, is one in which electrons are \ntransferred from one atom to another .\nFor example, when metallic zinc is added to a solution containing copper(II) sulphate (CuSO\n4), zinc reduces Cu2+ by donating two electrons to it. Therefore, Zn is oxidized \nand copper is reduced and oxidation – reduction or redox reaction takes place as shown in the following chemical equation:\n  Zn + CuSO\n4→ ZnSO4 + Cu\n  Zn + Cu2+→ Zn2+ + Cu\nOxidation and reduction reactions can also be defined in terms of oxidation number."

For example, the molecular mass of H\n2O is used to determine the \npercentage of hydrogen, and the formula mass of NaCl is used to determine the percentage of sodium. What is molecular mass or formula mass? \nMolecular Mass (MM) is the sum of masses of all the atoms present in a molecule.\nExample 1.17 :\nMM of H\n2O = 2 x 1 amu (2 hydrogen atoms) + 16  amu (1 oxygen atom) = 18 \namu, \nMM of CO2 =12 amu (1carbon atom) +2 x 16 amu (2 oxygen atoms) = 44 amu \nIonic compounds are not comprised of discrete molecules, but rather, ions.

The mass of a formula unit is called its formula mass. \nFomula Mass ( FM) is the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms present in the formula unit of the compound, whether it is molecular or ionic. But FM is used \nmostly for ionic compounds.\nExample 1.18 : \nFM of NaCl = 23 amu (1Na) + 35.5 amu (Cl) = 58.5 amu.\nFM of Ca(OH\n2)2 = 40 amu (1Ca) + 2 x [16 amu(1O) + 2 amu (2H)] = 76 amu\n1.5.2 The Mole Concept\nAt the end of this topic, students will be able to\n\"define mole and explain the concept using examples;\n\"define molar mass; \n\"calculate the molar masses of substances."

This number is known as Avogadro’s number \n(NA), in honor of Amedeo Avogadro (1776-1856, who first proposed the concept). The term mole, like a dozen or a gross, refers to a particular number of things. A dozen of eggs equals 12 eggs, a gross of pencils equals 144 pencils, and a mole of any substance equals 6.02x10\n23 units of the substance.\nExample 1.19: 1 mole of H2O equals 6.02 x 1023 molecules of H2O\n  1 mole of NaCl equals 6.02 x 1023 formula units of NaCl\nMolar mass is the molecular mass or formula mass expressed in grams.

Here, you deal with two types of formulas, \nempirical formulas and molecular formulas. \nEmpirical formula (or simplest formula) for a compound is the formula of  a substance \nwritten with the smallest ratio (whole number ratio) subscripts.

The difference is that the composition of the substance is always the same/constant regardless of the source or the way it is made. NaCl, for instance, is always formed in a ratio of 23 is to 35.5 by mass. But a homogeneous mixture of NaCl and water may be formed by combining them in various proportions; 5 g in 100 g or 10 g in 100 g water; would all give a \nhomogeneous mixture of NaCl and water called a solution. When a spoonful of sugar dissolves in water, the composition of the mixture, after sufficient stirring, is the same throughout the solution. This solution is a homogeneous mixture. \nA heterogeneous mixture is a mixture that consists of physically distinct parts, each \nwith different properties. This type of mixtures has at least two visible phases. Mixture \nof oil and water, wood ash and water,  sand and water, etc. are good examples."

Suspensions\nMixtures can further be classified into suspensions, colloids, and solutions. A suspension \nis a heterogeneous mixture in which the solid particles are spread throughout the \nliquid without dissolving in it. A mixture of chalk and water, sand and water, mixture of slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and water, muddy water are some examples.\nB. Solutions\nSolutions are all around us. The air we breathe and much of what we drink for \nexample, soda, coffee, and tea, and the fluids in our body are all solutions. A solution is a homogeneous mixture of a solute dissolved in a solvent. Because of dissolution of \nsolute in solvent, the particles in solution are of the size of individual atoms, molecules \nor ions. The solvent part of the solution is usually a liquid but can be a gas or a solid (see types of solutions in subsequent section). Generally, the major component of the solution is called solvent, and the minor component is called solute . If both components \nin a solution are 50%, the term solute can be assigned to either component. When a gaseous or solid material dissolves in a liquid, the gas or solid material is called the solute . When two liquids dissolve in each other, the major component is called the \nsolvent and the minor component is called the solute . \nNote that all solutions are homogeneous mixtures but not all homogeneous mixtures are solutions.\nProperties of Solutions\nA solution has a single uniform phase and has no visible boundaries because the components are individual atoms, ions, or molecules. These components do not settle \nupon standing or separate by filtration. \n\" The particles of a solution are very small that they can pass through the pores \nof even fine filter paper. So, solute cannot be separated from the solvent by filtration.\n\" The solutions are very stable; the components do not separate, neither coagulate upon standing."

For example, a solution of sodium chloride and water can be separated by distillation or evaporation. \nTypes of Solutions\nAlthough we usually think of solutions as liquid, they can exist in all three physical states: solid, liquid, and gas. \ni.Gaseous solutions : Gaseous solutions are usually described as gas-gas solutions \nwhere both solute and solvent are gases. The atmosphere is a gaseous solution that \nconsists of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, water (in the form of vapor), \nmethane, and some other minor components. The major component (Nitrogen) is regarded as a solvent and the other components are regarded as solute. Other example is natural gas (See unit 6 for details).\nii.Liquid soluti ons: Solids, liquids and gases dissolve in a liquid solvent to form \nliquid solutions. Some examples include carbonated beverage (gas and liquid), alcoholic beverage (liquid in liquid), and sea water (solid in liquid). Note that in liquid solutions the solute can be a solid, a liquid, or a gas but the solvent is always a liquid. \niii.Solid solutions : Many alloys, ceramics, and polymer blends are solid solutions . \nSolid solutions have no restriction on the state of the solute but the solvent has to be solid. Alloys are solid-solid solutions. Dental filling solution is a good example of liquid (mercury)-solid (silver) solution. Other examples of solid solutions include wax, and H\n2 in Pd (gas in solid; used for hydrogen storage). \nProject 2.1Do you know how jewellery gold is made?

Colloids\nA colloid is a heterogeneous mixture in which insoluble particles of one or more \nsubstances are suspended uniformly throughout another substance. Properties of Colloids\"A colloid (or colloidal solution) appears to be homogeneous but actually, it is heterogeneous upon closer inspection.\n\"The size of particles in a colloid is bigger than those in a true solution but smaller than those in a suspension. It is between 1 nm and 100 nm in diameter.\n\"The particles of a colloid can pass through a filter paper. So, a colloid cannot be separated by filtration.\n\"There are two phases in colloidal solution. They are known as the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium. The component present in smaller proportions is the dispersed phase while the one present in greater proportion is the dispersion medium.\n\"Colloids are quite stable. The particles do not separate on keeping.\n\"A colloid (or a colloidal solution) scatters a beam of light passing through it (because its particles are fairly large). As a result, these rays as well as colloidal particles become visible. The phenomenon in which the particle in a colliod scatter the beams of light that are directed at them and make the path of the light beam visible is called Tyndall effect ( Figure 2.1). This effect is not observed in true \nsolutions. You may expect suspensions to display Tyndall effect. But the Tyndall effect in suspensions disappear as the particles settle down."

But the formation of liquid and solid \nsolutions requires overcoming the solute-solute and solvent-solvent inter-particle forces of attraction before the mixing step. Because the solute as well as the solvent particles are held to each other by intermolecular forces in liquid and solid state. The solution process thus involves three basic steps; i. breaking up the solute-solute inter-particle forces ii. breaking up the solvent-solvent inter-particles forces iii. formation of solute-solvent interaction. \nThus, the extent of dissolution of a solute in a solvent is governed by intermolecular \nforces. The energy change associated with the dissolution process and entropy (the increase in disorder) that result when molecules of the solute and solvent mix to form \na solution are the forces driving the solution process.\nNote t hat: the formation of a solution from a solute and a solvent is a physical process, \nnot a chemical change. \n2.2.1 Liquid Solutions and Inter-particle Forces of Attractions\nWhen one substance (the solute) dissolves in another (the solvent), particles of the \nsolute disperse throughout the solvent.

As you read about covalent and ionic \ncompounds in Grade 9, you learned that ionic compounds have the highest polarity forming full cations and anions within each formula unit as electrons are transferred from one atom to another. You also learned that a covalent bond is polar when the bonded atoms have different electronegativities and, thus, share the bonding electrons unequally. In diatomic molecules, such as HF, there is only one bond that is polar and the molecule is also polar. In larger molecules, molecular polarity is determined by the net dipole moment (imbalance of charge over the molecule); which in turn depends on both shape and bond polarity. Dipole moment (µ) is a measure of molecular polarity, given in the unit debye (D) derived from SI units of charge (coulomb, C) and length (m): 1 D = 3.34 x 10\n-30 C.m. \nSubstance s with zero or low electronegativity difference in between the bonding \natoms and having zero net dipole moment such as H2, O2, N2, CH4, CCl4 are nonpolar \nwhereas H2O, NH3, CH3OH, NO, CO, HCl, H2S, PH3, etc. having high electronegativity \ndifference in between the bonding atoms and having net dipole moment are polar compounds. See illustrations below where the dipole moments cancels out in carbon dioxide (CO\n2) but add-up to give a net dipole in water molecule (H2O). Note that \nthe presence of polar bonds does not always result in a polar molecule; we must also consider shape and the atoms surrounding the central atom.  \nO\nH H(b) H 2OCOO(a)\nThehorizontal compone nts of the two dipol es canc els out\neach othe r.

Therefore, CO2 is non-polar. H2OCO2\nThe horizontal components of the two dipoles cancels out each other. But the vertical components add-up to give a net dipole moment in H\n2O molecules. \nInter-particle/Intermolecular Forces \nYou studied in grade 9 that atoms in a molecule (e.g. Cl2, H2O, NH3, etc) are held \ntogether by covalent bond/s. The covalent bonds are called intramolecular forces-\nforce within a molecule. You are also familiar with the three states of matter-solid, liquid and gas. The gaseous state is characterized by absence of interparticle forces and hence the molecules of a gas are free to move independent of the other molecules."

When the solvent-solute interactions are \nstronger than those between solute-solute and solvent-solvent particles, the dissolution process becomes faster. A good example is dissolution of ethanol (alcohol) in water. The increasing surface area of the solute will increase the rate of dissolution because it increases the number of solute particles in contact with the solvent. Stirring or agitation of the mixture can also increase rate of dissolution.\n2.2.6 Energy Changes in Solution Process\nAt the end of this section students will be able to\n\"define heat of solution, solvation energy and hydration energy;\n\"apply the concept of heat of solution to the solution of ammonium nitrate crystal;\n\"apply the concept of heat of solution to the solution of sodium hydroxide crystal;\n\"explain how heat of solution is influenced by the inter particle interaction forces.\nFor instance, if you mix ammonium chloride in water in a flask, the flask gets cold. \nBut when sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is mixed in water, the flask gets hot. Why? The \nreason is attributed to the energy changes that accompany the dissolution process. As discussed earlier, the solution process involves three steps: breaking solute-solute interaction, breaking solvent-solvent interaction, and forming solute-solvent interactions or the mixing step. When the energy released during the third step in solution process, i.e. the mixing step is larger than the energy required to break the solute-solute and solvent-solvent forces, energy is released-the process is exothermic. This energy heats up the surrounding and that is why the flask gets hot. On the contrary, if the energy released in the mixing step is less than the energy required to break the solute-solute and solvent-solvent forces, the dissolution process absorbs energy from the surrounding and the surrounding (the flask) gets cold-the dissolution process is endothermic. The energy involved in the mixing step is called solvation energy. Solvation refers to the \nprocess of attraction and association of molecules of a solute and a solvent. Solvation energy is the energy released when solute molecules are solvated by solvent molecules. Solvation in water is called hydration. Thus, hydration energy is the energy released when solute molecules or ions are solvated by water molecules.\nThe heat of solution or enthal py of solution is defined as the amount of heat released or \nabsorbed during the dissolution process and can be calculated using the equation  q = m x Cg  x T Eq 2.1\nWhere q is the amount of energy released or absorbed in Joules (J), m is mass of \nthe solution, T is the temperature change (T\ni-Tf), Cg is the specific heat of solution \n(J/g.oC) (can be assumed to be the same as that of water, 4.184 J/g.oC for dilute \nsolutions). The unit of heat of solution is Joule or kJ. Heat (Enthalpy) of solution can either be positive (endothermic) or negative (exothermic) depending on the observed temperature change."

Hydration is usually exothermic, so heat is released when water molecules completely surround solute particles.    \nHow does Lattice Energy affect the Solubility of Ionic Solids?\nBreaking up the lattice is an endothermic process. Hydration of ions favors the \ndissolution of an ionic solid in water. Thus, Lattice energy works against the solution process (Figure 2.9 ), so an ionic solid with relatively large lattice energy is usually \ninsoluble.\nHydration energy\nLattice energy\nFigure 2.9  The effects of lattice energy and hydration energy on the solution process \nof ionic solids."

As the magnitude of the charge on the ions increases the lattice energy also increases. For this reason, you can expect substances with single charged ions to be more comparatively soluble, and those with multiple charged ions to be less soluble in water. Lattice energy is inversely proportional to the inter-particle distance between the centers of the two ions. Thus, CsCl has less lattice energy than NaCl.\nExamples of Endothermic and Exothermic Processes\nWhen sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water, the solution becomes hot (the solution process is exothermic). On the other hand, when ammonium nitrate is dissolved in water, the solution becomes very cold (the solution process is endothermic). This cooling effect from the dissolving of ammonium nitrate in water is exploited in instant cold packs used in hospitals. An instant cold pack consists of a bag of NH\n4NO3 crystals inside a \nbag of water (Figure 2.10 ). When the inner bag is broken, NH4NO3 dissolves in the \nwater. Heat is absorbed, so the bag feels cold. Hot packs, by contrast, containing either CaCl\n2 or MgSO4, produce heat when the salts dissolve in water (Figure 2.10 ).\nFigure 2.10  The instant cold compress and hot compresses\nNote:  Enthalpy of solution is only one part of the driving force in the formation of \nsolutions; the other part is the entropy of solution.

Therefore, if you filter off the solution and add more solute, it doesn’t dissolve.  A simple analogy is “when you have eaten your feel, you are saturated!” \nUnsaturated solution is the solution that has not reached its maximum solubility. This \nmeans that more solute could still be added to the solution and dissolving would still occur.\nSupersaturated solutions are solutions that have dissolved solute beyond the normal \nsaturation point. Usually a condition such as increased temperature or pressure is required to create a supersaturated solution. For example, sodium acetate has a very high solubility at 273 K.  When cooled, such a solution stays dissolved in what is called a meta-stable state. However, when a seeding crystal is added to the solution, the extra solute will rapidly solidify, leaving a saturated solution ( Figure 2.13). During the \ncrystallization process, heat is evolved, and the solution becomes warm. Common hand warmers use this chemical process to generate heat."

What is the \nconcentration of Pb2+, in parts per million?\nGiven Required Solution\nMass of solute (Pb2+) = \n5.4 µg = 5.4x10-6 g    \n               Mass solution = 2.5 gConcentration in ppm\nppm =Mass of solute    x 106\nMass of solution  \n            = [(5.4 x 10-6 g)/(2.5 g)] x106 \n       = 2.16 ppm\nNote that the sum of 2.5 g and 5.4 g is approximately equal to 2.5 g. When \nreporting contaminants like lead in drinking water, ppm and ppb concentrations are often reported in mixed unit values of mass/volume.  This can be very useful as it is easier for us to think about water in terms of its volume, rather than by its mass. In addition, the density of water is 1.0 g/mL or 1.0 mg/0.001 mL which makes the conversion between the two units easier. For example, if we find that there is lead contamination in water of 4 ppm, this would mean that there are:\n4 ppm =4 mg lead                  \n     1,000,000 mg solution\nThis is a very dilute solution,  so the sum of masses of solute and solvent can be \napproximately equal to the mass of the solvent\nNow, let’s convert 1,000,000 mg of water into volume:\nV =mass   \n      density \n  = [(1,000,000 mg)/(1 mg/0.001 mL)] = 1,000 mL = 1L"

Show all the necessary steps and let your teacher check it!Exercise 2.13\n2.6 Solution Stoichiometry\nAt the end of this section students will be able to\n\"use stoichiometrically equivalent molar ratios to calculate amounts of reactants \nand products in a reaction of pure and dissolved substance.\nIn Unit 3 you studied about stoichiometric calculations in terms of the mole method, \nwhich treats the coefficients in a balanced equation as the number of moles of reactants \nand products. Solving stoichiometry problems for reactions in solution requires the additional step of converting the volume of reactant or product in solution to amount (mole) using the relationship MV = number of moles of solute. \nGenerally, we follow these steps:\n1.Balance the equation. Note that the coefficients in chemical equation indicate \nnumber of moles.\n2. Find the amount (mol) of one substance from the volume and molarity.3. Relate it to the stoichiometrically equivalent amount of another substance. 4. Convert to the desired units."

Since this kind of information is very useful, you often need to write the molecular equation as an ionic equation. Consider the reaction of silver nitrate and sodium chloride. Both are soluble ionic substances and are strong electrolytes. When they dissolve in water, they go into solution as ions giving on the reactant side of the reaction:\n  Ag\n+(aq) +  NO3_(aq)   +  Na+(aq) + Cl_(aq)\nOn the product side of the equation, AgCl(s) is an ionic compound that doesn’t dissolve \nin water, but the ions are held together in particular sites in the crystalline solid. We leave the formula as AgCl(s) to convey this information in the equation. On the other hand, NaNO\n3 is a soluble ionic compound and is a strong electrolyte. Also it dissolves \nin aqueous solution to give freely moving ions. Therefore, we can write it as \n  Na+(aq) + NO3–(aq)\nThe complete equation is\nAg+(aq) +  NO3_(aq)   +  Na+(aq) + Cl_(aq)  → AgCl(s)  + Na+(aq)  +  NO3_(aq), \nThe ions appearing on both sides of the equation (Na+ and NO3–) are called spectator \nions, as they do not take part in the reaction and they can be canceled on both sides \nto express the essential reaction that occurs.\nAg+(aq) +  NO3_(aq)   +  Na+(aq) + Cl_(aq)  → AgCl(s)  + Na+(aq)  +  NO3_(aq)\nThe resulting equation is: \n  Ag+ (aq) +  Cl_(aq)  → AgCl(s)   \nThis net ionic equation, is without spectator ions and the reaction that actually occurs at \nan ionic level is between silver ions and chloride ions which forms solid silver chloride.Steps for writing a net ionic equation\n1.

The major component is the solvent, while \nthe minor component is the solute. The terms miscible and immiscible, instead of soluble and insoluble, are used for liquid solutes and solvents. The statement like dissolves like is a useful guide to predicting whether a solute will dissolve in a given solvent.\n\"For liquid solutions formed from a solvent A and solute B, an ideal solution results when the A-B attractions are the same as the A-A and B-B attractions and for such a solution, ΔH\nsoln = 0. \n\"When the A-B attractions are greater than the A-A and B-B attractions, ΔHsoln< 0 \nand the solution process is exothermic. \n\"When the A-B attractions are weaker than the A-A and B-B attractions, ΔHsoln> 0 \nand the solution process is endothermic.\n\"Dissolving occurs by solvation, the process in which particles of a solvent surround the individual particles of a solute, separating them to make a solution. For water solutions, the word hydration is used. If the solute is molecular, it dissolves into individual molecules. If the solute is ionic it dissolves into ions. The individual ions separate from each other, forming a solution that conducts electricity. Such solutions are called electrolytes . If the dissociation of ions is complete, the solution is a strong \nelectrolyte. If the dissociation is only partial, the solution is a weak electrolyte. If a solution is made up of molecules only, it does not conduct electricity and is called nonelectrolyte .\n\"The amount of solute in a solution is represented by the concentration of the solution. The maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved in a given amount of solvent is called the solubility  of the solute. Such solutions are saturated. Solutions \nthat have less than the maximum amount that it can dissolve are unsaturated . \nMost solutions are unsaturated, and there are various ways of stating their \nconcentrations.\n\"A dilute solution is one in which there is a relatively small amount of solute dissolved in the solution.\n\"A concentrated solution contains a relatively large amount of solute.\n\"These two terms do not tell us whether or not the solution is saturated or unsaturated. They are used for comparing concentrations of two solutions in a more general qualitative sense. \n\"Solubility  depends on two factors, predominantly intermolecular forces of \nattraction and to some extent conditions (surface area, temperature, pressure). \n\"Increasing the temperature usually increases the solubility of solids  in water \nand liquids in water while it decreases the solubility of gases in water.

Start-up Activity \n3.1 Introduction\nBy the end of this section, students will be able to \n\" define inorganic compounds; \n\" classify inorganic compounds as oxides, acids, bases and salts.\nThe term inorganic compound refers to all compounds that do not contain carbon \nexcept simpler compounds of carbon like oxides (eg CO2), carbonates (eg CaCO3) \nand carbides (eg SiC). Inorganic compounds are compounds consisting of mineral constituents of the earth or generally found in nonliving things. Compounds found in living things are generally organic compounds (see unit 6 for the details). The majority of metal compounds are inorganic.\nInorganic compounds are mostly found in nature as silicates, oxides, carbonates, \nsulphides, sulphates, chlorides, nitrates, etc.\nInorganic compounds are generally classified into four groups namely oxides, acids, \nbases and salts. \nWe are familiar with the utility and importance of oxides, acids, bases and salts in \nour daily life.  For example, we know that the carbon dioxide (CO\n2) gas in CO2-fire \nextinguisher is an oxide, the sour taste of vinegar is due to acetic acid (CH3COOH), \nsodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a base used in the preparation of soaps, and sodium \nchloride (NaCl) is common salt which is useful as a food ingredient.  This unit deals with the chemical nature and formation of more oxides, acids, bases and salts."

Acid anhydride means acid without water. Generally speaking, acidic oxides are non-metal oxides. Examples of acidic oxides include carbon dioxide, CO\n2, nitrogen dioxide, NO2, and sulphur dioxide, SO2. However, it \nis very important to note that all non-metal oxides are not necessarily acidic oxides.  For example, carbon monoxide, CO, and di-nitrogen monoxide, N\n2O, are non-metal \noxides, but they are neutral oxides which will be discussed later (D).  There are acidic oxides that do not react directly with water. The acids of such oxides are formed by other methods.

Many foods, including citrus fruits and some vegetables, contain acids. \nAcetic acid in vinegar, citric acid in lemons and other citrus fruits, are among the \nacids that we encounter every day.

In the study of chemistry the term acid has \nbeen used to name a group of compounds which have a sour taste.\nArrhenius Definition of Acids\nThe simplest definition of acids is suggested by Savante Arrhenius, a Swedish Chemist. Arrhenius defined an acid as a substance that releases hydrogen ion or proton, H\n+, \nor hydronium ion, H3O+, in aqueous solution.  In general, the ionization of acids takes \nplace as follows.\nHA(aq) → H+(aq) + A– (aq)   or   HA(aq) + H2O(l) → H3O+(aq) + A–(aq)\nExample 3.5 : \nHCl(aq) → H+(aq) + Cl–(aq) or HCl(aq) + H2O(l) → H3O+(aq) + Cl–(aq)\nH2SO4(aq) → 2H+(aq) + SO42-(aq) or H2SO4(aq) + 2H2O(l) → 2H3O+(aq) + SO42–(aq) \nAccording to this definition, for a substance to be an Arrhenius acid, it should contain ionizable hydrogen.  Some examples of Arrhenius acids are HNO\n3, H2SO4, H3PO4, \nHBr, HI and HF. \nAlthough the Arrhenius concept has limited scope yet, it led to the development of \nmore general theories of acid-base behavior. Broader Acid-base definitions will be dealt in grade 12 chemistry."

The dissociation of \npolyprotic acids in aqueous solution is shown in the following chemical equations:\n  H2SO4 (aq) → 2H+ (aq) + SO42– (aq)\n  H2CO3 (aq) ⇌ 2H+ (aq) + CO32– (aq)\n  H3PO4 (aq) ⇌ 3H+ (aq) + PO43– (aq)\nAmmonia (NH3) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) have \nthree hydrogen atoms but ammonia does not behave \nas a triprotic acid. It is a base. Why? Discuss in your group and present it to the class.\nActivity 3.9\nB. Classification of Acids Based on the Number of Elements they Contain\nAcids can also be cl assified depending on the number of their constituent elements \nas binary and ternary acids. Binary acids are those acids composed of only two \ndifferent elements. The two elements are hydrogen and a non-metal."

Lemon juice and orange juice taste sour due to the presence of citric acid. Citric acid in lemon juice and orange juice is harmless. However, concentrated acids are corrosive and poisonous. So the test ‘taste’ is never allowed to identify acids especially in the \nlaboratories.\nII. Acid s change the color of certain acid-base indicators. The common indicators \navailable in high school laboratories are litmus, phenolphthalein,   methyl orange \nor methyl red and universal indicator. Note that natural dyes like red extract of cabbage leaves, petals of some colored flowers and turmeric also act as indicators \nto test the presence of acid or base.\nExperiment 3.4 \nEffect of Acids on Indicators\nObjective: To detect the acidity of a solution using indicators.Chemicals: Lemon juice, dilute HCl, dilute HNO\n3, dilute H2SO4\nphenolphthalein, litmus, methyl red, universal indicatorApparatus:  Test tubes, test tube rack, test tube holder, and reagent bottles."

They are of great importance in chemical industries and in our daily lives, directly or indirectly. For example, sodium hydroxide, NaOH is used in the production of soap, paper, textile etc. \nPotassium hydroxide, KOH is used to produce soft soap, fertilizers etc. Calc ium \nhydroxide, Ca(OH)\n2, is used to manufacture mortar and bleaching powder, to remove \nsoil acidity etc.Arrhenius Definition of Bases\nAccording to the Arrhenius theory, a base is a substance that produces a hydroxide ion (OH\n-) when it is dissolved in water. Soluble bases are called alkalis .\nFor example, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are bases because they produce OH- ion when dissolved in water. \nNaOH (aq) → Na (aq)\n+ + OH-(aq)\n  KOH (aq) → K+ (aq) + OH- (aq)\nNote that the ions produced by the base can come from either of two sources. Metal hydroxides, such as NaOH, KOH, and Ba(OH)\n2, are ionic compounds that already \ncontain ions and merely release those ions when they dissolve in water. Ammonia, however, is not ionic and contains no ions in its structure. Nonetheless, ammonia is a base because it undergoes a reaction with water when it dissolves, producing NH\n4+\nand OH– ions:\n  NH3 (aq) + H2O (l) ⇌ NH4OH(aq) → NH4+ (aq) + OH-(aq)\nThe reaction of ammonia with water is a reversible process whose equilibrium strongly favors unreacted ammonia."

This property is because of the OH\n– ion given by \nthe base.\n3.Alkalis release hydroxide ion in aqueous solution: The characteristic properties of bases in aqueous solutions are due to the presence of the hydroxide ion, OH\n–\nwhich they release on dissolution.\nExample 3.19 : NaOH (aq) → Na (aq)+ + OH– (aq)\n    KOH (aq) → K+ (aq)  + OH– (aq)\n4.

Can a strong base be a dilute base and a weak base concentrated base? Discuss in class.\n2.Why solutions of weak bases give dim light and solutions of strong bases give bright light? Discuss \nin class.\nActivity 3.16\nStrength of Bases (Strong and Weak Bases) \nA strong base is almost completely ionized in aqueous solution to give its constituent \ncations and anions. That is the extent of ionization of a strong base is very high. Thus, \nthe amount of hydroxide ions ( OH–) in the solution of a strong base is large.\nKOH (aq) → K+ (aq) + OH– (aq)\nHydroxides of alkali (Group IA) metals and lower members of alkaline earth metals such as LiOH, NaOH, KOH, and Ba(OH)\n2 are examples of strong bases. Strong bases \nare strong electrolytes as they produce large amount of ions and conduct high current.A weak base is only partially ionized into its cations and anions in aqueous solution. That is, the extent of ionization of a weak base is small. Thus, the amount of hydroxide ions (OH\n–) in the solution of a strong base is small.\nNH4OH (aq) ⇌ NH4+ (aq) + OH–(aq)  \nThe double arrow shows that the dissociation of a weak base does not proceed to \ncompletion. This means an aqueous solution of a weak base contains only a small amount of ions derived from the dissociation of the base and a large amount of the non-ionized base. For example, a solution of ammonia containing 0.1 mole NH\n3 per \nlitre of solution ionizes only to the extent of 1.3%. Weak bases are weak electrolytes as they allow low current.  Examples of weak bases include Mg(OH)\n2 and Ca(OH)2.\nConcentrated and Dilute BasesThe concentration of an alkali is a measure of the number of moles of the alkali dissolved in 1 litre of solution and is therefore expressed in mol per liter. Concentrated bases contain relatively large amounts of a base in a given volume of solution while dilute base solutions contain only a small amount of base. The concentration is expressed in terms of mole per litre (Molarity).  \nThe greater the number of moles of the base per liter of the solution, the more \nconcentrated is the solution. For example, a solution containing ten moles of NaOH \nper litre is more concentrated than the solution containing two moles of NaOH per"

Thus, both a strong base and a \nweak base may be concentrated or dilute depending on the number of moles of the base present per liter.\nPrecautions in Handling Bases\nStrong bases like NaOH and KOH are known as caustic alkalis.  The word “caustic” refers to a substance that can cause burning.  Thus, it is very important to avoid contact of these bases with any part of our body or clothing.  Not only strong bases but also weak bases are corrosive.  For example, concentrated ammonia solution can cause blindness if splashed into the eye.\nThe following safety precautions are useful in handling bases in school laboratories or \nanywhere while working with thema. Wear eye goggles, gloves and a laboratory coat.b.If bases are spilled on your working tables wipe the spillages immediately.\nc.Whenever bases are splashed on your cloth, wash the affected part with running water.\nd.If a base enters your eyes, wash with water repeatedly as first aid treatment and seek medical advice.\ne.If a base is swallowed by accident, drink 1-2% acetic acid or lemon juice immediately.\nf.Whenever bases come into contact with your skin, wash the affected part with plenty of water and then wash the affected part with a very dilute solution (about 1%) of a weak acid such as acetic acid.\npOH (note that ‘p’ is  small, O and H are capitals!)\n1.Since water, H2O, has H+ and OH–, it is both acidic \nand basic.

Activity 3.17\npOH is a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions in an acidic or a basic solution. It is defined as the negative logarithm of hydroxide, OH\n– ion concentration.\n  pOH = - log10[OH–] \nRelationship Between pH and pOHThe pH and pOH are related mathematically as pH + pOH = 14This equation can be derived using the ionic product of water, Kw, as follows: The ionic product of water, Kw is the product of the concentration of [H\n+] or [H3O+] \nand [OH–]."

The process \nof absorbing water from the atmosphere by a solid to form a solution is called deliquescence.\nExample : Calcium chloride(CaCl\n2), Sodium nitrate (NaNO3), Iron(III) chloride (FeCl3) \nEfflor escent salts  lose their water of crystallization to the atmosphere. The loss of \nwater of crystallization by solid crystals to the atmosphere is known as efflorescence.\nIt is very important to note that all deliquescent substances are hygroscopic, but all hygroscopic substances are not necessarily deliquescent.\nExample 3.22 : Hydrated sodium carbonate (Na\n2CO3•10H2O), Hydrated sodium \nsulphate (Na2SO4•10H2O) \n3.

When different salts containing the same anion are heated, they may not show similar behavior. Some salts are thermally stable while others undergo decomposition. The following examples illustrate this fact.\nA. Thermal decomposition of carbonates \nAll the carbonates of Group IIA undergo thermal decomposition to the metal oxide \nand carbon dioxide gas. The term “thermal decomposition” describes splitting up a compound by heating it. Carbonates are salts containing a carbonate, CO\n32-, as an \nanion.\nIf “M” represents any one of the elements, the following describes this decomposition:\n  MCO3(s) → MO(s) + CO2\nThe carbonates of Group IIA are: MgCO3, CaCO3, SrCO3, BaCO3\nThe carbonates become more thermally stable down the group. In Group IA, lithium \ncarbonate behaves in the same way, producing lithium oxide and carbon dioxide:\nLi2CO3(s) → Li2O(s)+CO2\nThe rest of the Group IA carbonates do not decompose at laboratory temperatures,"

Surrounding is anything else \nthan the system in the universe. Each particle in a system under investigation, such as a reaction mixture in a test tube, has potential energy and kinetic energy , and the sum \nof all these energies is the internal energy, E of the system. \nInternal energy of a system is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energies of the \ncomponents of the system.\n  (Internal Energy)\nsystem = (potential energy + kinetic energy)system\nPotential energy is stored energy. It is stored in chemical bonds. Kinetic energy is the \nenergy due to motion. It causes work to be done through movement.

It is concerned with the use of electricity to cause chemical reactions (changes) to happen or generating electricity from chemical reactions. Thus, electrical energy and chemical energy are inter-convertible.\n4.2.2 Electrical Conductivity\nWhy do metals conduct electricity? Do you know any non-metal which conducts electricity? Electrical conductivity is the ability of a substance to transmit electricity. The materials that allow the passage of electricity through them are called electrical conductors. Electricity is constituted by movement of charged particles or charge carriers. Electrons carry negative charge whereas ions may carry positive (cations) or negative (anions) charges. Depending on the nature of the particles responsible for the flow of electric charges through conductors, electrical conductivity can be classified as metallic conductivity and electrolytic conductivity.\na) Metallic conductivity\nElectrical conductivity in metals is a result of the movement of electrically charged particles called electrons. The atoms of metal elements are characterized by the presence of valence electrons; which are electrons in the outer shell of an atom that are free to move about. It is these \"free electrons\" that allow metals to conduct an electric current. Because valence electrons are free to move, they can travel through the metallic lattice that forms the physical structure of a metal. Silver is the best electrical conductor.\nMetallic lattice can be described as an atmosphere of positive ions in a sea of mobile \nelectrons (Figure 4.3 ). The electrons entering the metal displace (repel) the freely \nmoving electrons at the point of entry. The displaced electrons occupy new positions by pushing neighboring electrons ahead. This will continue until electrons are forced out of the wire at the opposite end. The charge carriers in metallic conduction are electrons. Hence, metallic conductivity is also called electronic conductivity.\nFree electron Nucleus Electrons \noutElectrons \nin\nFigure 4.3  Electrical conductivity in metals."

Unlike metallic conductivity, the conductivity of electrolytic solutions depends on the type and concentration of ions in solution. Based on their degree of ionization or the extent to which they produce anions and cations, electrolytes can be classified as strong electrolytes or weak electrolytes. Recall from unit 2 that many ionic compounds such as NaCl dissociate completely in water and are therefore called strong electrolytes. \n  NaCl (aq) → Na\n+ (aq)  +  Cl_ (aq)\nWhen electrical potential is applied through an electrolyte solution, the positive ions \n(cations) move in one direction and the negative ions (anions) move in the opposite direction. This movement of ions through the electrolyte, brought about by the application of electricity, is called electrolytic conductivity.

An electrolyte is a substance that, when dissolved in water, results in asolution that can conduct electricity. In order to conduct a current, a substance must contain mobile ions. All ionic compounds are electrolytes. When ionic compounds dissolve, they dissociate (break apart) into ions, which are then able to conduct a current. Thus, we can represent sodium chloride dissolving in water as\n  NaCl(s) \n Na+(aq) + Cl-(aq)H2O\nWhat this equation says is that all the sodium chloride that enters the aqueous solution \nends up as Na+ and Cl- ions; there are no undissociated NaCl units in solution.\nEven insoluble ionic compounds, such as CaCO3, are considered electrolytes because \nthey can conduct a current in the molten (melted) state.

Most polar covalent compounds, such as table sugar (C\n12H22O11), and all nonpolar covalent compounds are good examples of \nnonelectrolytes. When these compounds dissolve in water, they do not produce ions. An equation can still be written that simply shows the solute going into solution without dissociating into ions.

Fuel cells will be discussed in grade 11. Both primary and secondary cells are batteries that store electrical energy in the form of chemical energy. The chemical energy is converted into electrical energy when we the battery is in use.  \nPrimary Cells (Battery Cells)\nPrimary cells or also known as battery cells are galvanic cells that are not rechargeable. This is because once the chemicals in the cells that serve as reactants are completely used up, it is not possible to recover them by charging the cells. Examples of primary cells include Daniell’s cell and zinc-carbon (Leclanche) dry cells. The common feature of all Galvanic cells is that they contain two electrodes in contact with an electrolyte. The electrolyte in a Galvanic cell can be in the form of a solution (Daniell cell) or a paste (Leclanche cell). The cells containing electrolytes in the form of solution are called wet cells, and those containing electrolytes in the form of paste are called dry cells.\nAn example of a wet primary cell is the Daniell cell. It consists of a zinc strip placed \nin ZnSO\n4 solution in one compartment and a copper strip placed in copper sulphate, \nCuSO4, solution in another compartment (Figure 4.7 ). \nThe anode (zinc)electrode loses its massThe cathode (copper) electrode gains mass\nFigure 4.7  The Daniell Cell.\nEach compartment is called a half-cell, and the reactions occurring in each compartment are called half-cell reactions. The solutions in the two compartments are linked by a"

KCl solution and agar solution, which is then allowed to cool so that it sets in the form of a gel.\nIn the anode compartment, the zinc atoms from the zinc electrode lose two electrons \neach and become zinc ions, Zn\n2+. The ions enter into the solution, and the electrons \nremain on the electrode and flow through the external wire to the copper electrode (see anode half reaction below). This situation causes the zinc electrode to be negative and the solution to have an overall positive charge. In the process the anode (zinc) electrode loses its mass. That is why the anode of the galvanic cell is sometimes called sacrificial electrode. On the other hand, in the compartment containing the copper electrode, copper ions, Cu\n2+, from the solution move to the cathode and gain two \nelectrons each, to become copper atoms and deposit on the surface of the copper electrode (see cathode half reaction below). This condition causes the electrode to be positive and the solution to have a negative charge. In addition, the cathode continuous to grow in mass as more and more copper deposits on it. The electron flows from anode to cathode in the external conductor.\nThe half-cell reactions and the cell reaction in Daniell cells are represented asAnode reaction: Zn(s) → Zn\n2+(aq)  +  2e-\nCathode reaction: Cu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s)\nOverall (cell) reaction: Zn(s)  +  Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)\nDue to the oxidation-reduction reaction in the cell, the Daniell cell generates electricity.\nWhat is the purpose of the salt bridge in Figure 4.7 ? From the preceding discussion, \nit is clear that the solution in which the zinc electrode is placed has an overall positive \ncharge while the solution in the copper compartment has a negative charge. Unless the two solutions are neutral, the cell cannot produce electricity. Thus, the purpose of the salt bridge is to maintain electrical neutrality between the two solutions. \nAlthough, wet cells like the Daniell cell can serve as a source of electricity, they are not \nportable since they contain solutions. Due to this practical problem of using wet cells, dry cells were developed. In a dry cell, a moist electrolyte paste is used instead of solutions. This cell was invented by Georges Leclanche, a French chemist.\nWe commonly use Leclanche cells as convenient, portable sources of energy. Flashlights \nand radios are examples of devices that are often powered by the zinc–carbon, \nor Leclanché, dry cell ( Figure 4.8 ). This voltaic cell has a zinc can as the anode; a \ngraphite rod  in the center, surrounded by a paste of manganese dioxide, ammonium \nand zinc chlorides, and carbon black, as the cathode . It produces electricity as a result \nof a spontaneous redox reactions: \nAnode reaction: Zn(s) → Zn\n2+(aq)  +  2e-\nCathode reaction: 2NH4+(aq) + 2MnO2(s) + 2e →  Mn2O3(s)  +  H2O(l)  +  2NH3(aq)"

The electrode reactions can \nbe reversed, and the original reactants can be regenerated. This can be achieved by passing a direct current through the cell. The process is called charging or recharging. A secondary cell needs to be recharged when it stops producing electricity. A lead storage battery is an example of a secondary cell. A lead storage battery is the common automobile battery that usually delivers either 6 or 12 volts, depending on the number of cells used in its construction. The inside of this Voltaic cell consists of electrodes of lead alloy grids; one electrode is packed with a spongy lead  to form \nthe anode, and the other electrode is packed with lead (IV) oxide to form the cathode \n(see Figure 4.9). Both are bathed in an aqueous solution of 35% sulfuric acid, H\n2SO4.\nA single lead-storage cell delivers 2 volts. Therefore, a 12 V battery contains six cells connected in series ( Figure 4.9 ).\nFigure 4.9  A Lead - Storage Battery.

Lead-storage battery, as a secondary cell, is rechargeable when it runs \ndown. The electrode reactions can be reversed by applying a potential across the electrodes that is slightly larger than that which the battery can deliver. The reaction that takes place on recharging a lead storage battery is given by the following equation.\n  2PbSO\n4(s) + 2H2O(l) → Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 2H2SO4(aq)\nNote: The electrode that served as anode during discharging (use) is forced to behave \nas cathode during recharging. Consequently, the direction of the electron flow that \nwas from left (Pb = anode) to right (PbO2 = cathode) is changed to right (PbO2 = \nanode) to left (Pb = cathode). Oxidation always takes place at anode and reduction at cathode. The direction of electron flow is always from anode to cathode. \nProject 4.2\nDo you know how car batteries are maintained?

What are the components in the car battery? How are they assembled to a self-contained device? What is the advantage of car battery over other types of batteries such as dry cells? Each dry cell can generate 1.5 V. If we assemble 8 of them in series, we can generate 12.0 V.

Electrolysis stands for “ electro“ \nmeans electricity and “lysis” means to separate or break. So in terms, electrolysis \nwould mean \"breakdown via electricity\". An electrochemical cell in which electrolysis occurs is called electrolytic cell (Figure 4.10). It has two components, electrodes (anode and cathode) and electrolyte. \nIn electrolytic cell, the electrode connected to the positive terminal of the source (e.g. \nbattery) is positively charged and is called the anode. It is the electrode through which electrons leave the cell. The electrode connected to the negative terminal of the source is negatively charged and is called the cathode. It is the electrode through which electrons enter the cell (see Figure 4.10 )."

The positive ions are attracted to the cathode and are called cations. Since the cathode has excess electrons, the cations will discharge by gaining electrons. This process of gaining electrons is called reduction. The negative ions are attracted by the positive electrode ( anode) and are called anions. These ions are discharged by \nlosing electrons (get oxidized) at the anode. This process of losing electrons is called oxidation. Thus, the cathode  is the electrode at which reduction occurs and the anode\nis the electrode at which oxidation takes place . \n4.4.1 Electrolysis of Molten (Fused) Electrolytes\nIonic solids can melt at elevated temperature. NaCl, for instance, melts at 801°C. The \nprocess is called melting or fusion. When ionic solids melt, they dissociate into positive \nand negative ions that are free to move. To understand the chemical reactions that occur during electrolysis of molten (fused) electrolytes, consider electrolysis of molten NaCl. Figure 4.11 shows a simple electrolytic cell.

Because these fuels form so much more slowly than we consume them, they are nonrenewable. In contrast, wood and other fuels derived from plant and animal matter are renewable. \nAll carbon-based fuels release CO\n2 when burned. The ability of CO2 to absorb \nheat plays a vital temperature-regulating role in the atmosphere. Much of the \nsunlight that shines on Earth is absorbed by the land and oceans and converted to heat. Like the glass of a greenhouse, CO\n2 traps some of the heat radiating back \nfrom Earth’s surface and, thus, warms the atmosphere. This process is called the natural greenhouse effect  which changes Earth’s climate. \nScientists are trying to develop alternative energy sources that do not release greenhouse gases. In addition to developing alternative energy sources to reduce fossil-fuel consumption, some researchers are studying carbon capture and sequestration, accomplished by large-scale tree planting and by liquefying CO\n2\nreleased from coal fired power plants and burying it underground or injecting it deep into the oceans. \nThe climate change is a concern to the global nations too. In 1997, the United \nNations Conference on Climate Change in Kyoto, Japan, created an international treaty that set legally binding limits on release of greenhouse gases. It was ratified by 189 countries, but not by the largest emitter of CO\n2, the United States. \nThe 2005 conference in Montreal, Canada, presented overwhelming scientific evidence that confirmed the human impact on climate change, but the 2009 conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, which was attended by representatives from 192 nations, failed to produce a legally binding agreement on emission targets. In late 2010, however, the conference in Cancun, Mexico, resulted in some financial commitments to help developing countries rely on alternative energy sources.\n1.Write the half-reactions for the electrolysis of the following molten compounds: a.

Natural resources can be classified as renewable and non-renewable resources. Renewable resources are resources that can be replenished (replaced) by natural processes. Examples are  water, air and  plant materials (biomass). Non-renewable resources are resources that are found in a fixed amount in nature and cannot be replenished. Fossil fuels, nuclear energy, metallic and non metallic minerals are examples of non-renewable resources. Metallic minerals are minerals which contain one or more metallic elements. Non-metallic minerals are the minerals that do not contain metals. Metallic minerals occur in rare, naturally formed concentrations known as mineral deposits. \nThe principal source of metallic and nonmetallic minerals is the planet Earth. The \nmajority of metals and non-metals are extracted from their minerals. Minerals such as iron haematite (Fe\n2O3) or aluminum bauxite (Al2O3.2H2O), sulphides such as zinc \nblende (ZnS), or carbonates such as malachite (Cu(OH)2.CuCO3) are examples of \nmetallic minerals. Diamond, gravel, and mica are examples of nonmetallic minerals. Metals and non-metals can also be found in seawater.

Reactivity series of metals\nIf we take solution of different metals and place other metals in these solutions, we can compare the reactivity of metals with respect to each other. The arrangement of metals in the decreasing order of their activity is known as activity or reactivity series. The most active metal is at the top and the least active metal is at the bottom of the reactivity series. The hydrogen, a nonmetal, has been included in the series only for the comparison of the activity of the metals. The metals above hydrogen like potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium in the reactivity series liberate hydrogen gas when treated with dilute acids. The metals below hydrogen in the reactivity series like copper, silver, and gold do not liberate hydrogen when treated with dilute acids. A less reactive metal (low in reactivity series) can be displaced from its compound or from its salt solution by a more reactive metal (high in reactivity series). Thus, potassium can displace all the metals from their salt solution\nFigure 5.1  Reactivity series of metals.\nMetals at the top of the reactivity series are strong reducing agents.  Metals at the bottom in the reactivity series are weak reducing agents.  Hence, potassium is the strongest reducing agent whereas gold is the weakest reducing agent in the above reactivity series."

The raw materials \nfor the extraction of iron are iron ore, coke, limestone and hot air. The furnace is charged with a mixture of iron ore, limestone and coke at the top and a blast of hot air is blown at the bottom. The coke burns to form carbon dioxide and the temperature approaches 2000°C near the bottom. As the carbon dioxide rises up, the coke reduces it to carbon monoxide.

It is impure and \ncontains about 2 % silicon, up to 1% phosphorus and manganese, and traces of sulphur. These impurities make pig iron brittle. Pig iron, also known as crude iron, is an intermediate product of the iron industry in the production of steel. When pig iron is re-melted with scrap iron and cast in to moulds, it forms cast iron.

This purification process is carried out in a furnace at high temperatures. Three distinctive techniques are used to convert pig iron into steel. These are the Bessemer converter, \nOpen-hearth Furnace and the Basic Oxygen Process .\ni.The Bessemer Converter: In the process of converting pig iron to steel, molten pig iron from the blast furnace is transferred to a cylindrical vessel containing a refractory lining of MgCO\n3 and CaCO3.

The oxygen \npassing through the molten metal converts silicon, phosphorus and sulphur to their oxides, which then react with the lining to form a slag.

However, the reaction is difficult to control and the quality of the steel produced can be quite variable.\nii.The Open-hearth Furnace : It has a large, shallow hearth, which is usually lined \nwith a basic oxide refractory (MgO and CaO). The furnace is charged with a mixture of pig iron, Fe\n2O3, scrap iron and limestone.

It involves forcing a mixture of powdered \ncalcium oxide, CaO, and oxygen gas directly into the surface of the molten pig iron.

Do you know the chemical nature of this thin film? From your observations, what do you conclude about the reactivity of iron?\nIron is a reactive metal. Its reactivity is very slow, compared to group IA and IIA metals.\nIron rusts in the presence of air and moisture to form hydrated iron (III) oxide.                 Moisture 4Fe(s)   + 3O\n2(g)  2Fe2O3.xH2O(s)(rust)    \nIron reacts with dilute acids, like HCl and H2SO4, forming iron (II) salts and liberating\nhydrogen gas\n  Fe (s) + 2HCl (aq) → FeCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)\n  Fe (s) + H2SO4 (aq) → FeSO4 (aq) + H2 (g)\nLike other transition metals, iron also exhibits different oxidation states. It commonly \nexists as the ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe+3) ions. Iron (II) and iron (III) compounds are \ncoloured.Aqueous solutions of iron (II) compounds are pale-green and solutions of iron (III)\ncompounds are yellowish brown.\nAqueous solutions of some iron (II) compounds are rapidly oxidized to the corresponding\niron (III) compounds.

In the carbonate form, it \nexists as malachite (CuCO3.Cu(OH)2).\nCopper is principally extracted from chalcopyrite . Since the amount of copper in the \nore is very small, the crushed and ground sulphide ore is first concentrated by froth flotation. This treatment changes the concentration of the ore from 2 % copper to as high as 30% copper. The concentrated ore is then roasted with a limited supply of air (oxygen).\n  2CuFeS\n2 (s) + 4O2 (g) → Cu2S (s) + 2FeO(s) + 3SO2 (g)\nThe roasted mixture is smelted by adding limestone and sand to form a molten slag \nthat removes many of the impurities.

It exists as cuprous (Cu\n+) and cupric (Cu2+) ions. Compounds containing copper \nin the +2 oxidation state are stable. Cu1+ is unstable and cannot exist in aqueous \nsolution since it reduces and oxidizes (disproportionates) itself as follows:\n  2Cu+ (aq) → Cu2+ (aq) + Cu (s)\nSoluble compounds containing Cu+, such as CuCl, CuI and CuBr, are all colourless solids. \nThe most stable oxidation state of copper is +2. Aqueous solutions of many copper \n(II) compounds are blue, thus copper forms coloured compounds in the oxidation state of +2. For example, hydrated copper sulphate, CuSO\n4.5H2O, consists of blue crystals, \nand its aqueous solution is also blue.\nUses of Copper\nCopper is used to manufacture alloys. For example, bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, and it is used to make coins, medals, bells, machinery parts, etc. Brass is an alloy ofcopper and zinc, and it is used for hardware tops, terminals and pipes.

Metals are ductile, malleable, sonorous, conductors of heat and electricity. Metals are reducing agents and mostly form basic oxides. The specific properties of metals vary widely from one metal to the other. Active metals always occur in compounds in the form of minerals. The most active metals are extracted from their compounds only by electrolysis because there is no stronger reducing agent that can reduce them from their compounds. The reactivity series is a useful guide to predict the relative reactivity of metals. \n\"Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth’s crust. It is manufactured by the \nelectrolysis of molten aluminum oxide mixed with cryolite using the Hall’s process. Aluminum is used to make light-weight alloys that can be used for aircraft and similar constructions. Aluminum resists corrosion due to the formation of a thin film of an oxide on its surface. \n\"Iron is the second-most abundant metal in the earth’s crust. Iron is extracted in a blast furnace. The furnace is charged with iron ore, coke and limestone, and hot air is blown up from the bottom. Limestone is used in the blast furnace to remove impurities like sand (silica) in the form of slag. The type of iron obtained directly from the blast furnace is called pig iron and it is impure. Wrought iron is the purest form of iron obtained from pig-iron by removing most of the impurities. Steel is an alloy of iron containing definite amounts of carbon and other metals like chromium, nickel, tungsten, vanadium, manganese etc. Steel is manufactured from the pig iron by the Bessemer converter, Open-Hearth Furnace and Basic Oxygen Processes. \n\"Copper is extracted by roasting chalcopyrites (CuFeS\n2). Copper that is obtained \nby roasting chalcopyrites is called blister copper. It is impure, and it is refined further by electrolysis. Copper is malleable and ductile, a good conductor of heat and electricity and is used to make electric wires and in the manufacture of alloys. \n\"The properties of nonmetals are opposite to that of metals. Some examples of nonmetals are nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous and chlorine.\n\"Nitrogen constitutes about 80% by volume of atm ospheric air. Nitrogen is \nmanufactured by the fractional distillation of liquefied air. Nitrogen is relatively inert. However, its reactivity increases when heated and combined with metals of group IA and IIA to form nitrides and with oxygen to form oxides like NO and NO\n2.\n\"Phosphorus is manufactured by heating a mixture of rock phosphate, coke (carbon) and silica in an electric furnace. Phosphorus has two common allotropes, white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is highly reactive, while red phosphorous is"

The answers to these questions are all around you.\nMost of the foodstuff that we consume every day such as fruits, vegetables, sugar, \nfats, starch, and vinegar are basically organic compounds. Similarly, substances \nsuch as pesticides, herbicides, fuels, dry cleaning chemicals, soaps and detergents, pharmaceuticals, alcoholic beverages, etc. are also organic compounds. Every living organism is made of organic compounds. A large number of organic compounds have been isolated and identified from plants and animals. The organic compounds that are synthesised by living organisms are called natural products . Although plants \nhave principally been used as a source of useful organic compounds such as those in traditional medicine, they also provide some organic compounds that are considered drugs of abuse because they lead to addiction and have negative socio-economic effects. Psychotropic plant chemicals such as nicotine from tobacco plant, cathinone from Chat (khat); from Catha edulis ; opium (morphine) from poppy plant and cocaine from \ncoca leaf are some examples. Some of these drugs are also used in doping. Doping is the misuse of certain substances and methods to enhance sporting performance and stamina. Although these compounds are perceived as useful to boost zealous, increase energy, and decrease fatigue, they have serious side effects such as personality disorder, low productivity, increased accidents, reduction of competitiveness, inability to cope with tasks that require higher-level judgment and fine motor skills.

According to Vitalism theory, organic compounds were only those that came from living organisms, and only living things could synthesize organic compounds through the intervention of a vital force. Inorganic compounds were considered those compounds that came from non-living sources. The German chemist Friedrich Wöhler , however, discovered in 1828 that an organic compound \ncalled urea (a constituent of urine) could be synthesized in the laboratory by evaporating an aqueous solution of the inorganic compound ammonium cyanate. With this discovery, the synthesis of an organic compound began the evolution of organic chemistry as a scientific discipline. Since Wohler’s discovery, chemists have developed a remarkably sophisticated ability to design and synthesize new organic compounds in the laboratory-medicines, dyes, polymers, and a host of other substances that are helpful to society.  \nO\nNH2 H2N\nUrea Ammonium cyanateHeatNH4+ _OCN\nTo date, over 50 million organic compounds are known. The list included organic compounds isolated from natural sources and also those which were synthesized in the laboratories. All of the organic compounds whether of synthetic or natural origin contain the element carbon. Therefore, organic chemistry, today, is defined as the study of carbon compounds except the oxides of carbon, carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, \ncyanides and cyanates . But why is carbon special? If you have a look at the periodic \ntable, you will see over a hundred elements listed there. The question that comes to mind is this: why should an entire field of chemistry be based on the chemistry of compounds that contain this specific element, carbon? \nThe reason is linked to the unique property of carbon called catenation. Catenation is \nthe ability of atoms of the same element to join together to form short or long chains and rings. Carbon atoms can form strong covalent bonds to one another to form rings and chains of carbon atoms. And also they can form strong bonds to elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Because of these bond-forming properties, carbon can be the basis for the huge diversity of compounds . A few other elements \nlike sulphur, silicon and boron show this behavior, but to a much lesser extent."

Is pure ‘natural vitamin C from orange juice’, for example, healthier than pure ‘synthetic vitamin C’; or both are important? Discuss! \n  Activity 6.1 \n6.1.2 Structural Representations of Organic Molecules\nBefore we proceed to the main topic of this unit-the hydrocarbons, we shall briefly \nreview the bonding concept. Recall from your Grade 9 that carbon has four valence electrons and it can form four covalent bonds with other atoms. You also studied Lewis structure- a representation of covalent bonding in which shared electron pairs of covalent bonds are shown as pairs of dots or lines between two atoms and lone pairs are shown as pairs of dots on individual atoms. However, as the size of the compound increases, it becomes difficult to portray the structure of molecules with the use of Lewis structure. This is why scientists have developed other structural representations including structural formula, condensed structural formula, bond-line representation, and polygon formula. Let us take a look at these structures.\na. Complete Structural Formula\nComplete Structural formula is obtained by representing the two-electron covalent bond by a single dash. A single dash represents a single bond, a double dash represents a double bond and a triple dash represents a triple bond. Lone pairs of electrons on heteroatoms such as oxygen, halogens and more, may or may not be shown. Methane (CH\n4), for instance, contains one carbon atom and four hydrogen \natoms. The carbon atom contributes its 4 valence electrons and the four hydrogen atoms contribute four electrons (each H atom contributes one electron). Therefore, the Lewis structures for a methane molecule having 4 + 4 = 8 electrons is drawn following the rule (see your grade 9 lesson) as:\nH H\nH H\nMethane Methane\nStructural Formula Lewis FormulaH H H H C C"

It is \nobtained by omitting some or all the dashes that represent covalent bonds. Hexane (C\n6H14) can be represented by the structural formula or the condensed structural \nformula as shown below.\nStructural Formula Condesed Structural Formula\nThe condensed structural formula can further be condensed by putting identical repetitive units in parenthesis and indicating their repetition using subscripts. For example, we can further condense CH\n3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 to CH3(CH2)4CH3.\nc. Bond-Line Structural RepresentationIn a bond-line structural representation, carbon and hydrogen atoms are not shown but are understood to be there based on the fact that each carbon forms 4 covalent bonds. The lines representing carbon-carbon bonds are drawn in a zig-zag fashion as exemplified by the bond-line structure for hexane and hexyl bromide: \n  \nC6H14, hexane C6H13Br, hexyl bromideBr\nOnly heteroatoms need to be indicated in bond line representation. The terminals \nin the bond-line structures denote methyl (CH3) groups unless indicated otherwise \nby a functional group, while the line junctions denote carbon atoms bonded to an appropriate number of hydrogen atoms required to satisfy the valency of the carbon atoms. Note that in hexyl bromide one of the hydrogens in the terminal CH\n3 on one \nside of the structure is replaced Br leaving a CH2Br group.\nd. Polygon FormulaThere are many organic compounds, in which carbon atoms are not joined in a chain, but rather are joined in a ring. These cyclic compounds are usually represented by polygon using bond-lines without showing carbon and hydrogen atoms. The corners of a polygon represent a carbon atom and the sides of a polygon denote a carbon-carbon bond. Similarly, if an atom or a group of atoms other than hydrogen is attached to carbon, then that atom or a group of atoms manifest in this structure. As example, cyclopentane (C\n5H10), cyclopentanol (C5H10O), cyclohexane (C6H12), and \nbromocyclohexane (C6H11Br) are depicted below:"

Why don’t we deal with individual entities? What is the basis of classification? Why do you think we should classify organic compounds and \nhow? \n  Activity 6.2\nWe have noted in section 6.1 about the unique properties of carbon giving rise to a \nvery vast number of organic compounds known. Indeed, more and more are being \nadded to the list each day. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity. Chemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features that are responsible for their properties so that members of a given family often have similar chemical behavior. \nThus, instead of having 50 millions of compounds with random reactivity, it is better \nto have a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably \npredictable. The structural features that make it possible to classify compounds into families are called functional groups.\nFunctional Groups\nA functional group  is a group of atoms and/or bonds within a molecule that has \na characteristic chemical behavior.

This includes alkane, alkene, alkyne, or their derivatives. Aromatic hydrocarbons are those hydrocarbons that contain a low hydrogen-to-carbon ratio. Benzene (C\n6H6), for instance, is a typical \naromatic hydrocarbon having a ratio of number of hydrogen atoms to number of carbon atoms only 1. \nFigure 6.1  Classification of hydrocarbons, A as aliphatic and aromatic and B as \nsaturated and unsuturated. \nHydrocarbons may also be classified as suturated and unsaturated. Generally \nspeaking, compounds such as alkanes (e.g. methane, CH4), whose molecules contain \nonly single bonds are referred to as saturated compounds . Because they contain the \nmaximum number of hydrogen atoms per carbon atoms that the carbon compound \ncan possess. Remember from Grade 9 that the valency of carbon is 4. This means C can form a maximum of 4 covalent bonds with 4 hydrogen atoms because each hydrogen can form only one (valency of H is 1). Compounds with multiple bonds, such as alkenes (e.g. ethylene), alkynes (e.g. acetylene), and aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. benzene), are called unsaturated compounds because they possess fewer than the maximum number of hydrogen atoms per carbon, and they are capable of reacting with hydrogen under proper conditions.

Primary (connect directly to one carbon), secondary (connect directly to two carbons), and tertiary (connect directly to three carbons) carbon atoms, quaternary (connected to four other carbons). The names for several of the unbranched alkanes are listed in Table 6.2 . The ending \n(suffix) for all of the names of alkanes is -ane . The stems of the names of most of the \nalkanes (above C\n4) are of Greek and Latin origin.

They are also relatively inert biologically and are not often involved in the chemistry of living organisms. \nAlkanes do, however, react with oxygen, halogens, and a few other substances under \nappropriate conditions."

Reaction with oxygen occurs during combustion in an engine or furnace when the alkane is used as a fuel. Carbon dioxide and water are formed as products, and a large amount of heat is released. The general equation for the combustion reaction of alkanes is: \n  \nwhere n is number of C atoms\nFor example, methane (natural gas) reacts with oxygen according to the equation:\nExample 6.7: CH4  +  2O2   →  CO2   +  2H2O  +  890 kJ/mol (213 kcal/mol)\n  2C4H10   + 13O2→ 8CO2  +   10H2O\nThe heat energy liberated is used to generate electricity, to move motor vehicles or \nto cook our food.\n2.Substitution Reaction : This is a reaction that involves the replacement of one atom \nor a group of atoms by another atom or group of atoms. Halogenation of alkanes \nis a very good example of substitution reaction. This reaction involves reacting alkanes with chlorine and bromine in presence of heat or sunlight. This type of reaction is called a photochemical reaction. The reaction of alkanes with chlorine and bromine proceeds in a sequence of steps. For example, let us consider the photochemical reaction of methane with chlorine (chlorination):\ni.Chain Initiating Step: This step involves the absorption of energy by the halogen molecule to generate reactive particles known as free radicals. A free radical is \nan atom or a group of atoms possessing an unpaired electron. A free radical is electrically neutral. A chlorine molecule absorbs light and decomposes into two chlorine atoms:\nii.Chain Propagating Step: This is a step involves reaction of the free radical from step i with the alkane and that consumes a reactive particle (free radical) produced in the chain initiation step and generates another free radical.\niii.Chain Terminating Step: In the chain-terminating step reactive particles (free radicals) are consumed but not generated.\nSuch a detailed step by step description of a chemical reaction is called a reaction mechanism."

The first \nstructure for benzene was proposed by August Kekulé in 1872. It consisted of a  six-\nmembered ring with alternating single and double bonds and with one hydrogen bonded to each carbon. He assumed that the ring contains three double bonds that shift back and forth so rapidly that the two forms ( Figure 6.7 ) cannot be separated. \nLater on, Kekulé assumption was found to be incorrect. Each structure has become \nknown as Kekulé structure. \nC\nC\nCCCCH\nHH\nHHH\nA Kekulé structure\nshowing all atomsA Kekulé structure\nas line -angl eformulasI II\nA Kekulé structure                 A Kekulé structure\nshowing all atoms             as line-bond formulas\nFigure 6.7  A Kekulé structure of benzene.\nToday, we represent benzene as a hybrid of two equivalent contributing Kekulé \nstructures .

All the carbon-carbon bonds in the molecule are the same in length and nature. Since structures I or II given above are not the true structures of the benzene molecule, the benzene ring is written in its resonance hybrid form. However, chemists continue to use a single contributing structure to represent benzene. \nFrom structures I and II in Figure 6.7 , one may think that benzene has three double \nbonds and has the same chemistry as that of alkenes. But, this is not true. Benzene \nand other aromatic hydrocarbons contain high degrees of unsaturation, yet fail to undergo characteristic alkene addition and oxidation–reduction reactions.

Natural Gas\nNatural gas is a mixture of gases that consists chiefly of methane (more than 90%) but also contains ethane, propane, and butane. Other gases such as, CO\n2, N2, O2 and H2S, \nmay also be present in natural gas. Natural gas is found in association with petroleum or alone. It is found in underground deposits several hundreds or thousands of meters below the earth’s surface, where it originated from the decay and decomposition of animal and plant remains millions of years ago. The composition of natural gas varies, depending on its place of origin. Natural gas is widely used as a fuel. It is advantageous over liquid and solid fuels and also other gases, except H\n2, due to its \nvery high heat of combustion.\nB.Petroleum (crude oil)\nThe word petroleum is derived from two Latin words, ‘ petra’ meaning rock, and \n‘oleum’ meaning oil. Thus, petroleum means rock oil. Petroleum (also called crude oil)\nis a complex mixture of fossil hydrocarbons that must be separated into fractions and \nthen further refined before it can be used. It is generally found along with natural gas in the form of a dark-coloured viscous liquid, which is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. Its composition varies according to its place of origin. However, crude oil mainly contains alkanes, cycloalkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. It also contains organic compounds consisting of nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen in small amounts.\nRefining of Crude Oil\nPetroleum refining begins by fractional distillation of crude oil into three principal cuts according to boiling point (bp): straight-run gasoline (bp 30–200 °C), kerosene (bp 175–300 °C), and heating oil, or diesel fuel (bp 275–400 °C). Further distillation under reduced pressure then yields lubricating oils and waxes and leaves a tarry residue of asphalt. The distillation of crude oil is only the first step in gasoline production, however. Figure 6.8 shows the fractional distillation set up for separating crude oil into \nits component fractions.\nThe major products (fractions) obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum \nand their uses are given in Table 6.7."

The highly branched compound 2,2,4-trimethylpentane \n(called isooctane in the petroleum industry) burns very smoothly (without knocking) in internal combustion engines and is used as one of the standards by which the octane rating of gasolines is established. According to this scale, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane has an octane rating of 100. Heptane, CH\n3(CH2)5CH3, a compound that produces \nmuch knocking when it is burned in an internal combustion engine, is given an octane rating of 0. Mixtures of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane and heptane are used as standards for octane ratings between 0 and 100. A gasoline, for example, that has the same characteristics in an engine as a mixture of 87% 2,2,4-trimethylpentane and 13% heptane would be rated as 87-octane gasoline.\nCH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3\nHeptane\n(octane number = 0)CH3C CH2CH CH3CH3\nCH3CH3\n2,2,4-trimethylpentan e\n(octane number = 100)\nBecause straight-run gasoline burns so poorly in engines, petroleum chemists have devised numerous methods for producing higher-quality fuels. One of these methods, catalytic cracking, involves taking the high-boiling kerosene cut (C\n11– C14) and \n‘cracking’ it into smaller branched molecules suitable for use in gasoline. What does cracking mean? Cracking is the decomposition of large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller ones by the application of heat (thermal cracking or pyrolysis) \nC\n16H34   C8H18  +  C8H16\nHexadecane Octane Octeneheat\nor in the presence of catalysts (catalytic cracking). Hydrogen gas can be added during cracking to saturate the alkenes formed in the process.\nAnother process, called reforming , is used to convert C\n6– C8 alkanes to aromatic \ncompounds such as benzene and toluene, which have substantially higher octane \nnumbers than alkanes. The final product that goes into the tank has an approximate composition of 15% C\n4– C8 straight-chain alkanes, 25% to 40% C4– C10 branched-\nchain alkanes, 10% cyclic alkanes, 10% straight chain and cyclic alkenes, and 25% arenes (aromatics).  \nC.
