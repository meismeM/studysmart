            "text": "Foreword\nEducation and development are closely related endeavors. This is the main reason why \nit is said that education is the key instrument in Ethiopia’s development and social transformation. The fast and globalized world we now live in requires new knowledge, skill and attitude on the part of each individual. It is with this objective in view that the curriculum, which is not only the Blueprint but also a reflection of a country’s education system, must be responsive to changing conditions. \nIt has been almost three decades since Ethiopia launched and implemented new Education \nand Training Policy. Since the 1994 Education and Training Policy our country has recorded remarkable progress in terms of access, equity and relevance. Vigorous efforts also have been made, and continue to be made, to improve the quality of education. \nTo continue this progress, the Ministry of Education has developed a new General Education \nCurriculum Framework in 2021. The Framework covers all pre-primary, primary, Middle level and secondary level grades and subjects. It aims to reinforce the basic tenets and principles outlined in the Education and Training Policy, and provides guidance on the preparation of all subsequent curriculum materials – including this Teacher Guide and the Student Textbook that come with it – to be based on active-learning methods and a competency-based approach.\nIn the development of this new curriculum, recommendations of the education Road Map \nstudies conducted in 2018 are used as milestones. The new curriculum materials balance the content with students’ age, incorporate indigenous knowledge where necessary, use technology for learning and teaching, integrate vocational contents, incorporate the moral education as a subject and incorporate career and technical education as a subject in order to accommodate the diverse needs of learners.  \nPublication of a new framework, textbooks and teacher guides are by no means the sole \nsolution to improving the quality of education in any country. Continued improvement calls for the efforts of all stakeholders. The teacher’s role must become more flexible ranging from lecturer to motivator, guider and facilitator. To assist this, teachers have been given, and will continue to receive, training on the strategies suggested in the Framework and in this teacher guide. \nTeachers are urged to read this Guide carefully and to support their students by putting into \naction the strategies and activities suggested in it. \nFor systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of curriculum materials, \nthe Ministry of Education welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to \nundertake further review and refinement."

Sir Joseph John Thomson was born \nnear Manchester, England, and educated at Owens College (now part of Victoria University of Manchester) and Trinity College, University of Cambridge. At Cambridge he taught mathematics and physics, served as Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics, and was (1918-40) master of Trinity College.\nThomson’s work on cathode rays led to the discovery of the electron in 1897. His later work with positive ion beams led to a method of separating atoms and molecules by mass and the discovery of neon. Thomson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 and was knighted in 1908.\nCathode Rays\nOne of the first experiments on subatomic particles was carried out by the English physicist J.J. Thomson in 1897. Figure 1.1 shows an experimental apparatus similar \nto the one used by Thomson. In this apparatus, two electrodes from a high-voltage source are sealed into a glass tube from which the air has been evacuated. The negative electrode is called the cathode ; the positive one, the anode. When the high-voltage \ncurrent is turned on, the glass tube emits a greenish light. Experiments showed that this greenish light is caused by the interaction of the glass with cathode rays, which \nare rays that originate from the cathode .\nFigure 1.1: Formation of cathode raysSir Joseph Thomson"

This beam bends \naway from the negatively charged plate and toward the positively charged plate. What did Thomson conclude from this observation? Figure 1.2 shows a similar \nexperiment, in which cathode rays are seen to bend when a magnet is brought toward them. Thomson showed that the characteristics of cathode rays are independent of the \nmaterial making up the cathode. From such evidence, he concluded that a cathode ray consists of a beam of negatively charged particles (or electrons ) and that electrons are \nconstituents of all matter. \nFigure 1.2: Bending cathode rays using a magnet\nBy measuring the amount of deflection of a cathode ray beam in electric and magnetic fields of known strengths, Thomson was able to calculate the ratio of the mass of an \nelectron, m\ne, to its charge, e. The number he came up with is – 5.686 × 10–12 kg C−1\n(kilograms per coulomb). However, he could not obtain either the mass or the charge separately. In 1909, Robert A. Millikan,  an American physicist, measured the charge \nof the electron by measuring the effect of an electrical field on the rate at which charged oil drops fell under the influence of gravity. Based on careful experiments, Millikan  established the charge on an electron as e = –1.602 × 10\n–19C.

Shortly after the discovery of \nradioactivity, three types of rays were identified in the emissions from radioactive substances. Two are deflected by oppositely charged metal plates (Figure 1.3). Alpha\n(α) rays consist of positively charged particles, called αparticles . They have a mass \nof about four times that of a hydrogen atom and a charge twice the magnitude of an electron; they are identical to helium nuclei. Beta (β)rays, or β particles , are electrons \ncoming from inside the nucleus and are deflected by the negatively charged plate. The third type of radioactive radiation consists of high-energy rays called gamma  (γ) \nrays. They have no charge and are not affected by an external electric or magnetic field.\nFigure 1.3: Three types of ray emitted by radioactive elements"

On the other hand, if a light has \nν > νo, the energy in excess of that required to remove the electron is given to the \nelectron as kinetic energy (KE):\n                   KEe  = ½ mv2 =  hν - hνo                      (1.5)\nWhere KEe is the kinetic energy of an electron, m is mass of an electron, v is the \nvelocity of an electron, hν, is the energy of an incident photon, and hνois the energy \nrequired to remove an electron from the metal’s surface. \nIntensity of light is a measure of the number of photons present in a given part of the \nbeam: a greater intensity means that more photons are available to release electrons (as long as ν > ν\nofor the radiation).  In his theory of relativity in 1905, Einstein \nderived the famous equation:\n  E = mc2                                                        (1.6)\nRearranging this equation, we have \n           2    Emc=                                          (1.7) \nWhere E is energy, m is mass, and c is speed of light.\nThe main significance of Equation 1.7 is that energy has mass. Using this equation, \nwe can calculate the mass associated with a given quantity of energy or the apparent \nmass of a photon. For electromagnetic radiation of wavelength, λ, the energy of each \nphoton is given by the expression:\n       photonhcE = λ                                     (1.8)"

He introduced the fundamental idea that the absorption and emission of light by hydrogen atoms was due to energy \nchanges of the electrons within the atoms. The fact that only certain frequencies are absorbed or emitted by an atom tells us that only certain energy changes are possible. Thus, energy changes in an atom are quantized ."

The further an electron is from the nucleus, the more energy it has. \n3. Only limited number of orbits with certain energies are allowed.

That means, the atom does not change its energy while the electron moves within an orbit.\n6.The electron moves to a higher energy orbit only by absorbing energy in the form of light, and emitting light when it falls to a lower energy orbit. The energy (photon) of the light absorbed or emitted is exactly equal to the difference between the energies of the two orbits.\nFurthermore, Bohr showed that the radii, r, of the permitted orbits or energy levels for \nan atom of hydrogen atom are related to Planck’s constant, h, the electron’s charge, \ne, and its mass, m. \nConsider hydrogen atom with an electron with constant speed, v, circulating the \nnucleus in an orbit of radius, r.

De Broglie reasoned that if electrons have wavelike motion and are restricted to orbits of fixed radii that would explain why they have only certain possible frequencies and energies.\nBy combining Einstein’s equation for the quantity of energy equivalent to a \ngiven amount of mass (E =  mc\n2)with Planck’s equation for the energy of a \nphoton  (E = hν = hc/λ), de Broglie derived an equation for the wavelength of \nany particle of mass, m, whether a planet, ball, or electron-moving at speed, v.\nh\nmv=λ                         (1.20)\nAccording to this Equation 1.20, matter and energy show both wave and particulate properties. The distinction between a particle and a wave is only meaningful in the macroscopic world, it disappears at the atomic level. This dual character of matter and energy is known as the wave-particle duality. \nExample 1.8\nCalculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron that has a velocity of 1.00 × 10\n6 m/s.

If a subatomic particle can exhibit the properties of a wave, is it possible to say precisely where that particle is located. A wave, extends in space, so its location is not defined precisely. \nIn 1827, Werner Heisenberg, the German physicist, proposed the Heisenberg \nuncertainty principle ,stating that it is not possible to know with great certainty \nboth an electron’s position and its momentum p (where p = mν) at the same time.\nHeisenberg was able to show that if ∆p is the uncertainty in the momentum and ∆x is \nthe uncertainty of the position of the electron, then: \n( )( ) ( ) ( )    or    44∆ ∆≥ ∆∆ ≥ππhhx p  x mv\nThis equation shows that if we measure the momentum of a particle precisely (i.e., if\n∆pis very small), then the position will be correspondingly less precise (i.e, ∆xwill \nbecome larger). In simpler terms, if we know precisely where a particle is, we cannot \nknow precisely where it has come from or where it is going. If we know precisely how a particle is moving, we cannot know precisely where it is.\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle has no practical consequence in everyday \nobjects in the macroscopic world. However, it has very significant consequences when applied to atomic and subatomic particles."

The mathematical description of such wave provides information about the energy of electrons and their position.  \nErwin Schrödinger (1927), suggested that an electron or any other particle exhibiting \nwavelike properties can be described by a mathematical equation called a wave \nfunction (denoted Greek latter psi, ψ). The equation is very complex. However, \nit leads to series of solutions that describe the allowed energy states of electrons. \nThe square of a wave function, ψ\n2, gives the probability of finding an electron in a \ncertain region of a space. The results of a quantum mechanics indicate that the electron may be visualized as \nbeing in a rapid motion within a given region of space around the nucleus. Although we cannot determine the precise position of an electron, the probability of the electron being at a definite location can be calculated. The region in which an electron is most likely found is called an orbital . The electron may occupy anywhere within an orbital \nat any instant in time. So, an electron can be considered as a particle that can rapidly move from place to place, behaving like an “electron cloud”  whose density varies \nwithin the orbital. \nIn quantum mechanics, each electron in an atom is descried by four quantum numbers. \nThree of the quantum numbers specify the wave function that gives the probability of finding an electron at various place in spaces. The fourth one is used to describe the spin (magnetic property) of the electrons that occupy the orbitals. The four quantum numbers are:\n1.The principal quantum number ( n) describes the main energy level, or shell, an\nelectron occupies. It may be any positive integer, n = 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. It describes \nthe size and energy of the shell in which the orbital resides and it is analogous to the energy levels in Bohr’s model.  \n2.The angular momentum quantum number ( ℓ) designates the shape of the atomic \norbitals. Within a shell different sublevels or subshells are possible, each with a characteristic shape. It takes values from 0to n-1. Orbitals of the same n,but"

Key experiments were those that established the mass-to-charge ratio and then the charge on an electron. \n~The principal types of radiation emitted by radioactive substances are alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. \n~Studies on the scattering of particles by thin metal foils (Rutherford’s atomic model) led to the concept of the nuclear atom − a tiny, but massive, positively charged nucleus surrounded by lightweight, negatively charged electrons. \n~Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (λ), frequency (ν), and speed (c = 3.0 × 10\n8 m/s), which are related by the formula: \nc = λν  \n~Electromagnetic radiation can be viewed as a stream of “particles” called photons, each with energy hν , where h is Planck’s constant (6.63 × 10\n34 J.s).\n~ When light strikes a metal surface, electrons are emitted.\n~Analysis of the kinetic energy and numbers of the emitted electrons led Einstein to suggest that electromagnetic radiation can be viewed as a stream of photons. \n~The photoelectric effect is the emission of an electron from the surface of a metal, caused by electromagnetic radiation of a certain minimum energy; the resulting current increases with increasing intensity of radiation.\n~Bohr’s theory requires the electron in a hydrogen atom to be in one of a discrete set of energy levels. The fall of an electron from a higher to a lower energy level releases a discrete amount of energy as a photon of light with a characteristic frequency.  \n~Bohr’s theory accounts for the observed atomic spectrum of hydrogen atom."

Thus, the s orbital (ℓ  = 0) is \nspherical and the p orbital ( ℓ = 1) is dumbbell-shaped.\n~ The n, ℓ and m\nℓquantum numbers define an orbital, but a fourth quantum \nnumber, ms, is also required to characterize an electron in an orbital. \n~The Aufbau (“building up”) Principle is a guide for predicting the order in which electrons fill subshells and shells in atoms.\n~According to Pauli's Exclusion Principle, no two electrons in the same atom may have identical sets of four quantum numbers.\n~Hund’s Rule states that each orbital of a given subshell is occupied by a single electron before pairing begins.\n~Electron configuration refers to the distribution of electrons among orbitals in an atom. Introduced here are the subshell notations (or s, p, d, and f ) and the orbital diagram."

Because all the noble gases (except helium) have outer shells with eight electrons, many atoms undergoing reactions also attain eight valence electrons (ns\n2np6).

So why does it occur? As you will see, the reason ionic substances exist at all is because of the enormous release of energy when the ions come together and form a solid.Consider just the electron-transfer process for the formation of lithium fluoride, which involves two steps:\n1. A gaseous Li atom loses an electron (IE\n1):\n       Li(g)  → Li+(g)    +     e−                     IE1 = +520 kJ\n2. A gaseous F atom gains an electron lost by Li atom (EA):       F(g)  +  e– →  F\n–(g)             EA = –328 kJ \nNote that the two-step electron-transfer process by itself requires energy:        Li(g) + F(g)  →  Li\n+(g) + F–(g)          IE1   +   EA  = +192 kJ\nThe total energy needed for ion formation is even greater than this because metallic lithium and diatomic fluorine must first be converted to separate gaseous atoms, which also requires energy. Despite this, the standard heat of formation ( ∆H\nf°) of solid LiF is \n−617 kJ/mol; that is, 617 kJ is released when 1 mol of LiF(s) forms from its elements. That is, there must be some exothermic energy component large enough to overcome the endothermic steps. These are:\n• When 1 mol of Li\n+(g) and 1 mol of F−(g) form 1 mol of LiF (g):\nLi+(g) + F–(g) → LiF(g)            ∆Η° = −755 kJ\n• When the gaseous ions coalesce into a crystalline solid. That occurs because each ion attracts others of opposite charge:\nLi\n+(g) + F–(g) → LiF(s)             ∆Η° = −1050 kJ\nThe negative of this value, 1050 kJ, is the lattice energy of LiF. The lattice energy (U) \nis the enthalpy change that occurs when 1 mol of ionic solid separates into gaseous ions. It indicates the strength of ionic interactions, which influence melting point, hardness, solubility, and other properties."

Some of the major factors are presented below.\nIonization energy (IE): The lesser the ionization energy, the greater is the ease of the \nformation of a cation. Thus, low ionization energy of metallic elements such as alkali and alkaline earth metals favours the formation of an ionic bond. \nElectron affinity (EA): A higher electron affinity favours the formation of an anion. \nGenerally, the elements having higher electron affinity such as halogens favour the \nformation of an ionic bond. Thus, low ionization energy of a metal atom and high electron affinity of a non-metal atom facilitate the formation of an ionic bond between them.\nLattice energy: When a cation and an anion come closer, they get attracted to each \nother due to the electrostatic (coulombic) force of attraction. The electrostatic force of \nattraction between oppositely-charged ions release a certain amount of energy and an ionic bond is formed. If the coulombic attraction forces are stronger, then more energy gets released and a more stable or a stronger ionic bond is formed. Larger lattice energy would favour the formation of an ionic bond. Lattice energy thus is a measure of coulombic attractive force between the combining ions. The lattice energy (U ) of an ionic compound depends directly on the product of the ionic charges (q\n1 × q2), and \ninversely on the distance ( r) between them: \n12Uqq\nr∝×"

In a covalent bond between atoms of different electronegativities, there is an unequal sharing of an electron pair and the electrons spend more of their time around the more electronegative atom. Such a bond is said to be polar covalent bond. The H–F bond \nis a polar bond because fluorine is more electronegative than the hydrogen atom.

A very polar \nmolecule is one with a large dipole moment, while a non-polar molecule will have a zero-dipole moment.\nNote: For a diatomic molecule, the bond moment is the dipole moment.

The basis of this approach is the assumption that electron pairs in the valence shell of an atom repel one another.\nValence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory\nIn a covalent bond, a pair of electrons, often called the bonding pair, is responsible \nfor holding two atoms together. However, in a polyatomic molecule, where there are two or more bonds between the central atom and the surrounding atoms, the repulsion between electrons in different bonding pairs causes them to remain as far apart as possible. The geometry that the molecule ultimately assumes (as defined by the positions of all the atoms) minimizes the repulsion. This approach to the study of molecular geometry is called the valence-shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) model.\nThe basic principle of VSEPR theory is that the pair of valence-shell electron pairs around the central atom arrange as far away from one another as possible to minimize electron-pair repulsions. The arrangements that best minimize repulsions naturally depend on the number of electron sets. Once we have counted the number of electron groups surrounding the central atom, we can determine its specific shape from the number of atoms bonded to the central atom. \nElectron Pair Arrangement and Molecular Shape\nThe electron pair arrangement is defined by the orientation/distribution of pairs of electrons, both bonding and non-bonding (lone pair), around the central atom. On the other hand, the molecular shape is defined by the relative positions of the atomic nuclei. Molecular shapes that occur when all the surrounding electrons are bonding differ from molecular shapes when some of the electrons are non-bonding. Thus, the same electron set arrangement can give rise to different molecular shapes. \nFor the prediction of geometrical shapes of molecules with the help of VSEPR theory, \nit is convenient to divide molecules into two categories as molecules in which the central atom has no lone pair and molecules in which the central atom has one or more lone pairs."

In general, according to the VSEPR model, the repulsive forces decrease in the following order:Lone pair vs lone pair > lone pair vs bonding pair > bonding pair vs bonding pair Why is that repulsions exerted by lone pair is greater than that of bonding pair? \nTo keep track of the total number of bonding pairs and lone pairs, we show molecules \nwith lone pairs as AB\nxEy, where A is the central atom, B is a surrounding atom, and E \nis a lone pair on A.

Intramolecular force is a chemical bond (ionic, covalent or metallic) that exists within a particle (molecule or polyatomic ion) and affects the chemical property of the species.Intermolecular force are those bonds that hold particles (ions or molecules) together. A glass of water for example, contains many molecules of water. These molecules are held together by intermolecular forces, whereas the intramolecular forces hold the two hydrogen atoms to the oxygen atom in each molecule of water. Intermolecular forces are relatively weak as compared to intramolecular forces, because they typically involve lower charges that are farther apart. However, the strength of the intermolecular forces is important because they affect physical properties of the species such as melting point and boiling point."

Ends of the dipoles possess “partial charges” and these charges are shown by Greek letter delta (δ).\nThis interaction is stronger than the London forces but is weaker than ion-ion interaction because only partial charges are involved.

They are good conductors of heat and electricity. Their strength indicates that the atoms are difficult to separate. \nTo what do properties of metals like malleability and ductility refer?\nThe regularity, but not rigidity, of the metal-ion array and the mobility of the valence \nelectrons account for the physical properties of metals.\nWe can explain a lot of the properties of metals by thinking about this model of \nmetallic bonding. The delocalized electrons are not attached to atoms, so they can move through the metal easily. This makes metals good conductors of electricity and heat, even when they are solid. \nWhy do not ionic compounds conduct electricity when they are in solid form? But \nconductor when they are dissolved in water? \nThe electrostatic bonds between the metal ions and the delocalized electrons are hard \nto break, so metals are strong. Why do metals bend or dent, rather than crack or shatter as ionic solids do when they struck by a hammer? Many metals can be flattened into sheets (malleable) and pulled into wires (ductile). The combination of strength and malleability means that metals are easy to bend but hard to break. This makes them extremely useful for making things.\nMetals have moderate to high melting points because the attractions between the \ncations and the delocalized electrons are not broken during melting, but boiling points are very high because each cation and its electron(s) must break away from the others. Gallium provides a striking example: it melts in your hand (mp 29.8 °C) but doesn’t boil until 2403 °C. The alkaline earth metals [Group IIA(2)] have higher melting points than the alkali metals [Group IA(1)] because of greater attraction between their 2+ cations and twice the number of valence electrons."

These new orbitals, called molecular orbitals (MOs), play the same role for molecules that \natomic orbitals play for atoms. Note that atomic orbitals are the allowed states for an electron moving in the field of one nucleus, whereas molecular orbitals are the allowed states for an electron moving in the field of several nuclei (atoms present in the molecules). \nWhich theory (VBT or MOT) perfectly explains all aspects of bonding?\nBonding and Anti-Bonding Molecular Orbitals\nIn contrast to VB theory, in which one bonding orbital is formed as a result of the \ninteraction of two atomic orbitals, in MO theory two molecular orbitals result from the combination of two atomic orbitals. In mathematical terms, the two molecular orbitals result from the addition of the atomic orbitals that overlap. The molecular orbitals that results from the addition of the atomic orbitals that overlap is called a bonding\norbital . In a bonding molecular orbital, because the electron density is concentrated \nbetween the two nuclei, the energy of the system is lowered compared with that of isolated atomic orbitals. The molecular orbital that results from the subtraction of atomic orbitals that overlap is called an antibonding molecular orbital . In antibonding \nmolecular orbitals, the electron density is concentrated away from the region between the two nuclei. That is, anti-bonding molecular orbitals have a region of zero electron density (a node) between the nuclei. The net effect of having a low electron density between the nuclei is that the two nuclei repel each other. Therefore, energy of an antibonding orbital is increased compared with that of the two isolated atomic orbitals.When two atomic orbitals overlap end-to-end, they form two σ MOs. Consider the H\n2 molecule, which has two H atoms and therefore two 1s AOs. The two 1s atomic \norbitals combine (Figure 2.28) to produce two σ MOs, which differ in energy and location. One of the σ MOs is a bonding orbital, denoted σ\n1s, the other is an anti-\nbonding orbital denoted σ*\n1s. The relative energy levels of these two MOs are different. \nThe σ1s MO has a lower energy than the original 1s AOs, while the σ*\n1s MO has a \nhigher energy. What is the advantage of VBT compared with that of MOT?"

For example, both electrons in H\n2 will go into the lower energy orbital denoted by (σ1s)2. There are no \nmore electrons in H2 so the σ*\n1s orbital remains empty in the ground state.

Various combinations of dipole-dipole, dispersion and hydrogen-bonding \nforces are operative in molecular solids, which accounts for their wide range of physical \nproperties. Dispersion forces are the principal forces acting in non-polar substances, so melting points generally increase with molar mass. Among polar molecules, dipole-dipole forces and where ever possible, hydrogen-bonding dominates. Compare the strength of intermolecular forces with covalent and ionic bonds. \nWhy do molecular crystals have much lower melting points than ionic, metallic and \nnetwork covalent solids?\nThe fundamental unit of a molecular solid is molecules or monatomic elements. Such \nsolids are common among organic compounds and simple inorganic compounds. Molecular crystals are usually transparent, brittle, and break easily when stressed. They are usually non-conductors  of heat and electricity and usually have low melting points.\nCan you give some examples of molecular crystals we use in everyday life? \nCovalent Network Crystals\nIn this type of crystalline solids, separate particles are not present. Instead, strong covalent bonds link the atoms together throughout the network of covalent solid. As a consequence of the strong bonding, all these substances have extremely high melting and boiling points, but their conductivity and hardness depend on the nature of their bonding. The two common crystalline forms of elemental carbon (graphite and diamond) are examples of network covalent solids (Figure 2.30). \n335 pm\n(a) (b)\nFigure 2.30: The structures of (a)  diamond and (b) graphite\nDescribe the basic differences in properties of graphite and diamond."

The fundamental units are atoms covalently bonded to their neighbours. These crystals are usually hard, non-conductors  of heat and electricity, and have high melting points. \nMetallic Crystals\nThe strong metallic bonding forces hold individual atoms together in metallic solids. Bonding in metals can be explained as a network of positive ions immersed in a sea of electrons. That is, the electrons in the valence shell of the metal atoms are highly delocalized. For this reason, metals are very good conductors of electricity. Metallic bonding forces are stronger than those arising from intermolecular forces, so metallic solids have higher melting points than molecular solids.\nMetals have a wide range of melting points and hardness, which are related to the \npacking efficiency of the crystal structure and the number of valence electrons available for bonding. For example, Group IIA metals are harder and higher melting than Group IA metals, because the IIA metals have closer packed structures and twice as many delocalized valence electrons. The fundamental units of pure metallic solids are identical metal atoms. Metallic crystals are opaque with reflective surfaces. They are ductile and malleable, good conductors of heat and electricity, and they usually have high melting points. Copper, silver, gold, iron and aluminum are familiar examples of metals."

An ionic bond can form between two atoms by the transfer of electrons from the valence shell of one atom to the valence shell of the other. \n~A covalent bond is a strong attractive force that holds two atoms together by their sharing of electrons. These bonding electrons are attracted simultaneously to both atomic nuclei, and they spend part of the time near one atom and part of the time near the other. \n~In some cases of covalent bonding, one atom appears to provide both electrons in the bonding pair; the bond is known as coordinate-covalent bond or dative bond.  \n~Molecular geometry refers to the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.\n~The valence-shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) model is a simple model for predicting molecular geometries.\n~In the valence bond method (VB) a covalent bond is viewed as the overlap of atomic orbitals of the bonded atoms in a region between the atomic nuclei. \n~In the VB theory, hybridized atomic orbitals are formed by the combination and rearrangement of orbitals of the same atom. \n~Hybridized orbitals are all of equal energy and electron density, and the number of hybridized orbitals is equal to the number of pure atomic orbitals that combine.\n~Molecular orbital theory describes bonding in terms of the combination and rearrangement of atomic orbitals to form orbitals that are associated with the molecule as a whole.  \n~Bonding molecular orbitals increase electron density between the nuclei and are lower in energy than individual atomic orbitals. Anti-bonding molecular orbitals have a region of zero electron density between the nuclei, and an energy level higher than that of the individual atomic orbitals."

Generally, the physical states of matter can be changed to solids, liquids, gases, or plasma by varying temperature and/or pressure.\nSolid\nA solid is rigid; it has a fixed volume and a fixed shape. Solids cannot be compressed. Solids have higher densities than liquids because their particles are usually packed closer than those in liquids. The tightly packed particles of solids are also highly organized.\nThe particles of a solid, whether they are atoms, ions or molecules, only vibrate at a \nfixed point with respect to the neighboring particles. As a result, its particles stay in a fixed position. Metals, chalk, sand, soil, and stone are examples of solids.\nLiquid\nA liquid has a definite volume, but does not have a definite shape. It takes the shape of its container. It is very slightly compressible and has the ability \nto flow. In a liquid, particles vibrate about a point, and constantly shift their positions. Water, ethanol, mercury, bromine, and oil are examples of liquids.\nGas\nA gas has neither definite volume nor definite shape; it takes on the shape and volume of its container. Gas is highly compressible because most of the volume of a gas is composed of the large amounts of empty space between the gas particles. For example, air, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen are gases.\nPlasma \nPlasma is the fourth physical state of matter that exists at a high temperature (million degrees Celsius). At such high temperatures molecules cannot exist. Most or all of the atoms are stripped of their electrons and thus, exist in their ionized form. This state of matter, a gaseous mixture of positive ions and electrons, is called plasma. In \nanother word, plasma is an ionized gas. Because of the extreme temperatures needed for fusion, no material can exist in the plasma state. Like gases, plasmas have no fixed shape and a fixed volume.

The kinetic theory of matter gives an explanation on the nature of the motion and the heat energy. According to the kinetic theory of matter, every substance consists of a very large number of very small particles called ions, atoms and molecules. The particles are in a state of continuous and random motion with all possible velocities. The motion of the particles increases with a rise in temperature.Generally, the kinetic theory of matter is based on the following assumptions:\n1. All matter is composed of particles that are constantly moving.2.All particles have kinetic energy (movement energy) and potential energy. Molecules in the solid phase have the least amount of energy, while gas particles have the greatest amount of energy.\n3. The difference between the three states of matter is the energy contents they \nhave and the motion of the particles. A change in phase may occur when the \nenergy of the particles is changed.\n4.The temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles.\n5. There are spaces between particles of matter. The average amount of empty \nspace between molecules gets progressively larger as a sample of matter moves from the solid to the liquid and gas phases.\n6. There are attractive forces between atoms/molecules, and these become \nstronger as the particles move closer together. These attractive forces are called intermolecular forces.\n/gid00425/gid00474/gid00424/gid00474/gid00424 /gid00017/gid00045/gid00042/gid00043/gid00032/gid00045/gid00047/gid00036/gid00032/gid00046/gid00001/gid00042/gid00033/gid00001/gid00014/gid00028/gid00047/gid00047/gid00032/gid00045\nActivity 3.3\nAttempt to answer the following question independently, and share your ideas with a friend who sits next to you.

The \nproperties of these three states of matter are explained in terms of the kinetic theory as follows:\nProperties of Gases\nFrom the kinetic molecular theory of gases, the following general properties of gases can be summarized.\n1.Gases have no fixed shape and fixed volume. They assume the volume and shape of their containers.\n2.Gases can be easily compressed. By applying pressure to the walls of a flexible container, gases can be compressed; the compression results in a decrease of its volume. This happens due to the large spaces between the particles of gases.\n3. Gases have low densities compared to liquids and solids. Because the particles \nof a gas are very far apart each other and the number of molecules per unit volume is very small. A small mass of a gas occupies a large volume and hence results in a very low density.\n4.Gases exert pressure in all directions. Gases that are confined in a container exert pressure on the walls of their container. This pressure is due to collisions between gas molecules and the walls of the container.\n5. Gases easily flow and diffuse through one another. A gas moves freely and \nrandomly throughout a given space.\nProperties of LiquidsLiquids have the following properties:\n1.Liquids have a definite volume, but have no definite shape. They assume the shapes of their container. Lack of a definite shape for liquid substances arises from low intermolecular forces of attraction between their particles as compared to that of solids.\n2.Liquids have higher densities than gases. Their density is a result of the close arrangement of liquid particles. Thus, the particles are closer in liquid than in their gaseous state. This accounts for the higher densities of liquids as compared to gases.\n3.Liquids are slightly compressible.  The available free space between particles in liquids is very little as a result, liquids resist an applied external force."

This model predicts the correct behavior for most gases under many conditions. Like other models, the kinetic molecular theory is not perfect. \nAssumptions of the kinetic molecular theory of gases:\n1. A gas is a collection of particles (molecules) in constant, straight-line motion.\n2.Gas particles do not attract or repel each other, they do not interact. The particles collide with each other and with the surfaces around them, but they bounce back from these collisions like pool balls.\n3. There is a lot of space between gas particles compared with the size of the \nparticles themselves. In other word, the volume of the particles is negligible compared to the total volume of the gas. The molecules are so far apart, the total volume of the molecules is extremely small compared with the total volume of the gas. This assumption explains why gases are so easily compressed and why they can mix so readily.\n4.The average kinetic energy of gas particles is proportional to the temperature of the gas in kelvins. This means that as the temperature increases, the particles move faster and therefore have more energy. The mathematically expressed as:\n2 1KE  = 2mv                               (3.1)\nWhere KE is kinetic energy, m is mass and ν is velocity of gas molecules.  According \nto this formula different molecules have different velocities and, therefore, have different kinetic energies. Generally, the gaseous state is characterized by the following physical properties:\n• Gases are highly compressible.\n• Gases exert pressure equally in all directions.\n• Gases have much lower density than solids and liquids.\n• The volume and the shape of gases are not fixed. These take the volume and shape of the container.\n• Gases mix evenly and completely."

They take the shape of their containers to the level they fill. Liquids are denser than gases, but less dense than solids.\nAs in a gas, particles in a liquid are in constant motion. However, the particles in a \nliquid are closer together than those in a gas. The attractive forces between particles in a liquid are stronger than between particles of a gas. This attraction between liquid particles is caused by the intermolecular forces of attraction such as dipole-dipole forces, London dispersion forces, and hydrogen bonding.\nLiquids are more ordered than gases because of the stronger intermolecular forces \nand the lower mobility of liquid particles."

Molecules on the surface of a liquid are held \nless tightly than those in the interior, so the most energetic molecule can break away into the gas.\n/gid00007/gid00036/gid00034/gid00048/gid00045/gid00032/gid00001/gid00425/gid00474/gid00430/gid00476/gid00001/gid00006/gid00049/gid00028/gid00043/gid00042/gid00045/gid00028/gid00047/gid00036/gid00042/gid00041/gid00001/gid00042/gid00033/gid00001/gid00039/gid00036/gid00044/gid00048/gid00036/gid00031\nEvaporation is explained in terms of the energy that the molecules on the surface of the liquid have. In an open container, evaporation continues until all of the liquid enters the gas (vapor) phase (Figure 3.8). Most of the molecules that escape into the vapor phase do notcollide with the surface of the liquid and return to the liquid \nphase. Instead, they will diffuse through the gas phase away from the container and equilibrium cannot be established. Under these conditions, the liquid will continue to evaporate until it has disappeared.\nHowever, liquids in a closed container behave differently. The volume of the liquid \ndecreases for some time, and then, remains unchanged. This is because in closed containers, the vapor cannot escape. As more molecules leave the liquid, more gaseous molecules collide with the container walls, with each other, and with the liquid surface and return to the original liquid state."

The vapor \npressure of a liquid depends up on the temperature. At a given temperature, vapor pressure is constant. The vapor pressures of liquids always increase as temperature increases because the rate of evaporation increases with increasing temperature.\nIntermolecular forces \nVapor pressure depends also on the intermolecular forces between the molecules of the liquid. The stronger the intermolecular forces, the lower will be the vapor pressure of the liquid because fewer molecules will have enough kinetic energy to overcome the attractive force at a given temperature. For example, water and ethanol have relatively low vapor pressure because the very strong hydrogen bonding in these liquids account for their unusually low vapor pressures. However, liquids with low intermolecular forces have high vapor pressures at room temperature. For example, diethyl ether, a non-polar molecule with relatively weak dispersion forces, has a relatively higher vapor pressure."

Liquid surface area is the amount of liquid that is exposed to the atmosphere (air).\nAs we previously discussed, liquids have no definite shape; instead, they take the \nshape of containers in which they are contained. So, the number of liquid molecules present at the surface increases as the surface area of the container (or the surface area occupied by the liquid) increases. This, in turn, increases the number of molecules that separate from the liquid surface and change into gases at a specific moment, increasing the rate of evaporation. However, for liquids having the same surface area, the rate of evaporation depends on the two factors: temperature and the strengths of intermolecular attractions.Boiling and Boiling Point\nActivity 3.17\nDiscuss the following questions in a group and report your responses to the whole class\n1.Atmospheric pressure is usually higher at a lower altitude than at a higher altitude. How does the kinetic-molecular theory explain this fact?  \n2.Ice melts normally at 0 °C. What happens to the melting point of ice in the presence of impurities? Does it melt below 0 °C, above 0 °C or exactly at 0 °C? Explain.     \nWhen heat energy is added to a liquid, it increases the kinetic energy of the molecules and the temperature of the liquid increases. Heating a liquid always increases its vapor pressure. When a liquid is heated to a sufficiently high temperature under a given applied (usually atmospheric) pressure, bubbles of vapor begin to form below the surface. If the vapor pressure inside the bubbles is less than the applied pressure on the surface of the liquid, the bubbles collapse as soon as they form. On the other hand, if the temperature is raised sufficiently, the vapor pressure is high enough that the bubbles can persist and rise to the surface, and burst, releasing the vapor into the air. This process is called boiling . In short, boiling is the change of a liquid to \nbubbles of vapor that appear throughout the liquids."

The normal boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid \nis equal to exactly one atmosphere.\nFor instance, water boils at 100 °C at 1.0 atmospheric pressure and thus, its normal \nboiling point of water is 100 °C. Nevertheless, the boiling point of water at 0.83 atm \nis 95 °C.

However, after sometime the intensity of the brown color becomes constant.\na.Why does the dark brown colour intensity decrease at the start?\nb.Why does the brown colour become constant, eventually?\nc.What will happen to the colour, if you check after a month?   \nChemical equilibria are dynamic equilibria,  i.e., reactants and products are \ninterconverted continually, even though the overall composition of the reaction mixture does not change.  Once the equilibrium is established, a change in one direction is balanced by changes in the other direction. \nTo understand the concept, consider Figure 5.1, which shows the change in the \nreaction rate with time for the forward and reverse reactions. The rate of the forward \nreaction depends upon the concentration of reactants, whereas the rate of the reverse reaction depends upon the concentration of the products. Initially, only the reactants are present, therefore, the rate of the forward reaction is fast. The reaction in the reverse direction does not take place as no product is present yet. \nAs the reaction progresses, the concentration of the reactants decreases and hence, \nthe rate of forward reaction also decreases. However, due to the increase in the concentration of products, the rate of the reverse reaction increases. As the reaction further progresses a point will be reached when the rate of forward reaction becomes equal to the rate of reverse reaction. When this stage is attained, the concentrations of reactants and products do not change. The reaction has reached  chemical equilibrium."

They combine to form ammonia at a large rate. As the reaction progresses, the concentrations of nitrogen and hydrogen decrease so the rate of formation of ammonia decreases. As more and more ammonia molecules are formed, some of the molecules start decomposing to give back nitrogen and hydrogen molecules. As the reaction progresses, the number of ammonia molecules increases, the   rate of decomposition of ammonia also increases. As the reaction proceeds, the rate of formation of ammonia decreases while the rate of decomposition ammonia increases. At a given point the two rates become equal, and equilibrium is reached.\nNote that the concentrations of products and reactants are not necessarily equal at \nequilibrium, only the rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Generally, a \nreaction at equilibrium has the following characteristics:\n•The reaction is reversible in nature.\n•There is no net change in the concentrations of the reactants and products of the reaction. \n•The rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.\n•The reaction should take place in a closed vessel to react at equilibrium.\n•The equilibrium is dynamic in nature.\n•The concentrations of reactants and products are generally not equal."

Hint: Refer to Unit 3 Physical States of Matter.   \nA change in pressure affects only equilibrium systems that involve gases. Pressure changes can occur in three ways:\n• changing the concentration of a gaseous component\n• adding an inert gas \n• changing the volume of the reaction vessel.\nAdding an inert gas has no effect on the equilibrium position. The reason is that inert gas molecules do not take part in the reaction and therefore cannot affect the equilibrium in any way. However, the addition of an inert gas increases the total pressure but has no effect on the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants or products. \nA pressure change obtained by changing the volume can aﬀect the yield of product in \na gaseous reaction if the reaction involves a change in total moles of gas.

Esters of low molecular mass are non-toxic liquids and thus used as solvents. Esters are used as solvents for oils and fats, nail polishes, varnishes, paints, gums and resins; medicine (e.g. Aspirin); clothing, e.g. polyesters (Dacron); fragrance in perfumes; and plasticizers (e.g. octyl phthalate).

Glycerol contains three alcohol groups and therefore \ncan form three ester groups. Fats and oils are widely found in nature especially in living things. They have long hydrocarbon tails which are derived from carboxylic acids, which make them hydrophobic. A triglyceride is called a fat if it is a solid or semi-solid at room temperature; it is called an oil if it is a liquid at that temperature. Triglycerides obtained from animals are usually solids, while those of plant origin are generally oils. Therefore, we commonly say animal fats and vegetable oils. Note that edible vegetable oils are entirely different from mineral oils such as petroleum.

When stored for any considerable length of \ntime, especially when the temperature is high and the air has free access to them, they deteriorate and spoil. Among the various fats, spoilage takes the form of rancidity.\nFats and oils develop an unpleasant odor due to rancidity. It is caused mainly due to \nthe hydrolysis of ester linkage and oxidation across the double bonds. In this respect, different fats differ markedly. Some spoil very much more rapidly than others. The fat acquires a peculiarly disagreeable odor and flavor.\nThe rancidity of a given fat is not necessarily the result of long storage under \nunfavorable conditions. The fat may have been spoiled and rancid from the moment of its production. This will inevitably be true when the materials from which it was produced have undergone decomposition. In other words, to obtain a sound and sweet fat, the raw material must be sound and sweet; it must be processed speedily before it gets time to decompose; and this must be done under clean and sanitary conditions. The fat obtained must be stored under favorable conditions and its consumption should not be delayed."
