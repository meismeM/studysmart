They pointed out that acid–base reactions can be seen as proton-transfer reactions and those acids and bases can be defined in terms of this proton (H) transfer. According to their concept, an acid is a proton donor and a \nbase is a proton acceptor.\nLet’s use the Brønsted–Lowry theory to describe the ionization of ammoniain aqueous \nsolution\nIn this reaction water acts as an acid. It gives up a proton (H+) to3NH, a base. As a \nresult of this transfer the polyatomic ions 4NH+ and OH− are formed- the same ions \nproduced by the ionization of the hypothetical 4NH OH  of the Arrhenius theory. \nHowever, they cannot be called Arrhenius bases since in aqueous solution they do \nnot dissociate to form OH−. The advantage of this definition is that it is not limited \nto aqueous solutions. Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases always occur in pairs called \nconjugate acid base pairs."

How are they formed? \nMolecular auto ionization (orself-ionization) is a reaction between two identical \nneutral molecules, especially in a solution, to produce an anion and a cation. If a pure liquid partially dissociates into ions, it is said to be self-ionizing. Water, as we know, is a unique solvent. One of its special properties is its ability to act either as an acid or as \na base. Water functions as a base in reactions with acids such as \nHCl  and 3CH COOH\n, and it functions as an acid in reactions with bases such as 3NH.

For example, 3 HCO−acts as an acid in the \npresence of OH− but as a base in the presence of HF. The most important amphiprotic \nspecies is water itself. When an acid donates a proton to water, the water molecule \nis a proton acceptor, and hence a base. Conversely, when a base reacts with water, a water molecule donates a proton, and hence acts as an acid. Consider, for example, \nthe reactions of water with the base \n3NH and with the acid 3CH COOH  (acetic acid)"

This example suggests that in a \nLewis acid-base reaction, we should look for:\n1.a species that has an available empty orbital to accommodate an electron pair \nsuch as the B atom in 3BF, and\n2.a species that has lone-pair electrons such as N in 3NH\nThe Lewis definition allows us to consider typical Brønsted-Lowry bases, such as \nOH−, 3NH, and 2HO , as Lewis bases. They all have electron pairs available \nto donate for electron-deficient species. Note that any molecule or negatively \ncharged species having an excess of electrons can be considered as a Lewis base, and any electron-deficient molecule or positively charged species can be considered as a Lewis acid."

A solution of a stronger base will contain a larger concentration of hydroxide ions than a solution of a weaker base if both solutions are of equal concentration.The net direction of an acid-base reaction depends on relative acid and base strengths: a reaction proceeds to the greater extent in the direction in which a stronger acid and stronger base form a weaker acid and weaker base."

The color of \nthe indicator depends on the pH of the solution to which it is added. When just a \nsmall amount of indicator is added to a solution, the indicator does not affect the pH\nof the solution. Instead, the ionization equilibrium of the indicator is affected by the \nprevailing 3HO+in the solution \n23se c r Acid colour Ba olouHIn H O H O In+−++\nIf the indicator is in a sufficiently acidic medium [increasing 3HO+], the equilibrium, \naccording to Le Châtelier’s principle, shifts to the left and the predominant color of \nthe indicator is that of the non-ionized form ( HIn). On the other hand, in a basic \nmedium [Decreasing3HO+] the equilibrium shifts to the right and the color of the \nsolution will be blue due to that of the conjugate base ( In−)."

Discuss this in terms of acid-base reaction.      \nAn equivalent is the amount of a substance that reacts with an arbitrary amount (typically one mole) of another substance in a given chemical reaction. In a more formal definition, the equivalent is the amount of a substance needed to react with or supply one mole of hydrogen ions (H\n+) in an acid–base reaction. For example, for \nSulfuric acid (24H SO  ) an equivalent is 2. \nForbases, it is the number of hydroxide ions ( OH−)ions provided for a reaction, for \nexample for Barium hydroxide (2 ()Ba OH )eqsuivalents is equal to 2. \nThe normality of a solution refers to the number of equivalents of solute per Liter of solution. \n    \n  Number of equivalents of solutesNormalityLiters of solution=\nThe definition of chemical equivalent depends on the substance or type of chemical reaction under consideration. Because the concept of equivalents is based on the react-ing power of an element or compound, it follows that a specific number of equivalents of one substance will react with the same number of equivalents of another substance. When the concept of equivalents is taken into consideration, it is less likely that chem-icals will be wasted as excess amounts. Keeping in mind that normality is a measure of the reacting power of a solution, we use the following equation to determine nor -\nmality:\nThus, according to the definition of normality, the number of equivalents is the \nnormality multiplied by the volume of solution, in litters. If we add enough acid to neutralize a given volume of base, the following equation holds:"

In a titration, one of the solutions to be neutralized say, the acid is placed in a ﬂask or beaker, together with a few drops of an acid base indicator (Figure 1.2). The other solution (the base) used in a titration is added from a burette and is called the titrant. The titrant is added to the acid (Titrand or analyte), first rapidly and then drop by drop, up to the equivalence point. The equivalence point of the titration is the point at which the amount of titrant added is just enough to completely neutralize the analyte solution. At the equivalence point in an acid-base titration, moles of base are equal to moles of acid and the solution contains only salt and water. The equivalence point is located by noting the color change of the acid base indicator. The point in a titration at which the indicator changes color is called the end point of the indicator. The end point must match the equivalence point of the neutralization. That is, if the indicators end point is near the equivalence point of the neutralization, the color change marked by that end point will signal the attainment"

Thus, Reduction \nis a process in which an atom gains an electron and therefore decreases its oxidation number. \nConsider the following example\n202 0 1\n2 () () ( ) () 2H Cl aq Cl aq g Mg s Mg H+ +\n+→ +\nIn the above reaction Mg metal is oxidized and H+ ions are reduced; the Cl- ions are \nspectator ions.

For example, if a solution has potassium ions and copper ions, the copper ions will accept electrons, and get discharged as copper atoms first. The potassium ions will not be affected. In general, if two or more positive ions migrate to the cathode, the ion lower in the series is discharged preferentially. Similarly, if two or more negative ions migrate to the anode, the ions lower in the series are discharged preferentially.\nThe Concentration of Ion\nHow is concentration of an ion affect preferential discharge?Higher the concentration of anions in the electrolytic solution, greater is its probability of being discharged at the anode. For example, a solution of sodium chloride in water \ncontains two types of anions i.e., the chloride (\nCl−) ions and the hydroxide ( OH−) \nions. The hydroxide ions are lower in the electrochemical series than the chloride ions. \nBut if the concentration of chloride ions is much higher than that of the hydroxide ions, then the chloride ions get discharged first.\nThe Nature of Electrode \nHow do electrodes affect the preferential discharge of ions?If the electrode used is inert i.e. made of less reactive material such as graphite, platinum etc, the electrode does not play any role in deciding the preferential discharge of ion at it.

The neutral atom, if solid, is deposited on the cathode and if gas, move upwards. This is a reduction process and the cation is, reduced at the cathode.\nAt the same time anions, give up their extra electrons to the anode and is oxidized \nto neutral atoms at the anode. Electrons released by the anions travel across the electrical circuit and reach the cathode completing the circuit. Electrolysis involves a simultaneous oxidation reaction at anode and a reduction reaction at the cathode. During electrolysis, the free ions furnished by the electrolyte are migrated towards oppositely charged electrodes and are discharged under electric potential. i.e. Cations migrate towards the cathode and are reduced. Anions migrate towards the anode and are oxidized.\nElectrolysis of concentrated Sodium Chloride solution (brine solution) \nWhich ions are discharged at the cathode and anode?\nSodium chloride is dissociated and exists as sodium and chloride ions in aqueous \nsolution. Electrolysis of sodium chloride is easier in aqueous solution. But, water itself can undergo reduction and oxidation reactions at different potentials. So, the substance that is oxidized or reduced is not sodium and chloride ions alone but it may involve the water molecule also. That is in the concentrated sodium chloride solution \nthere are \n+Na, Cl−, H+ and OH− ions that compute for preferential discharge. When \na potential difference is established across the two electrodes, +Naand H+ ions move \ntowards the cathode, and Cl−and OH− ions move towards the anode. The reduction \nreaction that occurs at the cathode does not produce sodium metal, instead, the H+\nis reduced as shown in Figure 2. 4. This is because the reduction potential for water \nis only−0.83V compared to −2.71V for the reduction of sodium ions. This makes the \nreduction of H+ preferable because its reduction potential is less negative. \nOn the other hand, you might expect H2O to be oxidized in preference to Cl−under \nstandard-state conditions, However, the potentials are close and over voltages at the \nelectrodes could alter this conclusion. It is possible, nevertheless, to give a general statement about the product expected at the anode. Electrode potentials, as you have seen, depend on concentrations."

They are used for making machines, railways, motor vehicles, bridges, buildings, agricultural tools, aircrafts, ships etc. Therefore, production of a variety of metals in large quantities is necessary for the economic growth of a country. Only a few metals such as gold, silver, mercury etc. occur in Free State in nature. Most of the other metals, however, occur in the earth’s crust in the combined form, i.e., as compounds with different anions such as oxides, sulphides, halides etc. \nA naturally occurring material in which a metal or its compound occurs is called a mineral.  A mineral from which a metal can be extracted economically is called an ore. An ore is that mineral in which a metal is present in appreciable quantities and from which the metal can be extracted economically\nIf a metal is less reactive than carbon, it can be extracted by reacting it with carbon \nin a displacement reaction. In a displacement reaction, the more reactive metal is able to take the place of a less reactive metal in a compound, since the more reactive metal forms stronger bonds. Carbon replaces the less reactive metal in a redox reaction, where the carbon is oxidized and the metal is reduced. We therefore refer \nto this method as reduction using carbon. But metals more reactive than carbon are \nextracted using electrolysis. Electrolysis is a process that uses electricity to separate the \nelements in a compound. Aluminum, for example, is a reactive and the most abundant metal on Earth, but it is most commonly found as its ore, aluminum oxide (Al\n2O3)."

When current passes through electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode dissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure metal from the electrolyte is deposited on the cathode. The insoluble impurities settle down at the bottom of the anode and are known as anode mud whereas the soluble impurities go into the solution (Figure \n2.7).For example: In the electrolytic refining of copper, the electrolyte is a solution of acidified .

However, if we physically separate the oxidizing agent from \nthe reducing agent, the transfer of electrons can take place via an external conducting \nmedium (a metal wire). As the reaction progresses, it sets up a constant ﬂow of electrons and hence generates electricity (that is, it produces electrical work such as driving an electric motor).The experimental apparatus for generating electricity through the use of a spontaneous reaction is called a galvanic cell or voltaic cell . (Figure 2.9) shows the essential \ncomponents of a galvanic cell. A zinc bar is immersed in a \n4 ZnSO  solution, and a \ncopper bar is immersed in a 4 CuSO  solution. The cell operates on the principle that \nthe oxidation of Zn to 2Zn+and the reduction of 2Cu+to Cu can be made to take \nplace simultaneously in separate locations with the transfer of electrons between them occurring through an external wire. The zinc and copper bars are called electrodes . \nThis particular arrangement of electrodes (\nZn and Cu) and solutions (4 ZnSO  and \n4 CuSO ) is called the Daniell cell. By definition, the anode in a galvanic cell is the \nelectrode at which oxidation occurs and the cathode is the electrode at which reduction occurs.

These electrons ﬂow through the external circuit to the copper electrode, where they react with the copper ions in that half-cell to deposit copper metal atoms. The net result is that zinc metal reacts with copper ions to produce zinc ions and copper metal, and electric current ﬂows through the external circuit."

This requirement is satisfied by a salt bridge, which, in its \nsimplest form, is an inverted U tube containing an inert electrolyte solution, such as\nKCl, 3 KNO or 43NH NO , whose ions will not react with other ions in solution or with \nthe electrodes (Figure 2. 9).\nDuring the course of the overall redox reaction, electrons ﬂow externally from the \nanode ( Zn electrode) through the wire and light bulb to the cathode ( Cu electrode). \nIn the solution, the cations (2Zn+,2Cu+, and K+) move toward the cathode, while the \nanions (2\n4SO−and Cl−) move toward the anode.

The force which causes the ﬂow of electrons from one electrode to another electrode and thus results in the ﬂow of current from electrode at higher potential to electrode at lower potential is called electromotive force (EMF).The EMF of the cell or cell potential can be calculated from the values of electrode potential of the two half cells constituting the cell.\n1.When oxidation potential of anode and cathode are taken into account \ncell anode cathode0 0 0 E  E E = −  2.When reduction potential of cathode and anode are taken into account \ncell cat hode d0 0 \nano e0E  E E − ="

For that \nreason, cell potentials provide a way to measure ion concentrations. The pH meter, for example, depends on the variation of cell potential with hydrogen-ion concentration. You can relate cell potentials to the standard electrode potentials by using the Nernst. Equation\nNernst Equation\nThe standard electrode potentials are measured in their standard states when the concentration of the electrolyte solutions are fixed as 1 M and temperature is 298 K. In actual practice electrochemical cells do not have always fixed concentration of the electrolyte solutions. The electrode potentials depend on the concentration of the electrolyte solutions. A change in concentration affects the change of cell potential which is a result of free energy change.

Likewise, silverware that comes into contact with foodstuffs develops a \nlayer of silver sulfide (\nAg S ). \nExercise 2.13\n1. Define corrosion.   \n2. Explain the negative effects of corrosion. 3. Aluminum does not rust as iron does. Why?   \nProtecting Against the Corrosion of Iron\nActivity 2.13\nForm a group and discuss each of the following questions. After the discussion, share your ideas with the other groups.\n1.How do we prevent iron from rusting?       \n2.What is common in all methods of preventing the rusting of iron?\nA number of methods have been devised to protect metals from corrosion. Most of these methods are aimed at preventing rust formation. The most obvious approach is to coat the metal surface with paint. However, if the paint is scratched, pitted, or dented to expose even the smallest area of bare metal, rust will form under the paint layer."

For example, in stainless steel, an alloy of iron and chromium, a layer of chromium oxide forms that protects the iron from corrosion. An iron container can be covered with a layer of another metal such as tin or zinc. The point regarding corrosion concerns the relative activity of other metals in contact with iron. The essential idea is that iron functions as both anode and cathode in the rusting process, but it is lost only at the anode . Thus\n1.Corrosion increases when iron behaves more like the anode . When iron is in contact \nwith a less active metal (weaker reducing agent), such as copper, it loses electrons more readily (its anodic function is enhanced; Figure 2. 18). Non conducting \nrubber or plastic spacers are placed between the metals to avoid this problem.\nFigure 2.18: The effect of Metal-metal contact on the   corrosion of iron; Fe\nin contact  with Cu corrodes faster.\n2.Corrosion decreases when iron behaves more like the cathode. In cathodic protection , the most effective way to prevent corrosion, iron makes contact with a \nmore active metal (stronger reducing agent), such as zinc. The iron becomes the cathode and remains intact, while the zinc acts as the anode and loses electrons (Figure 2. 19). Coating iron with a “sacrificial” layer of zinc is called galvanizing. \nIn addition to blocking physical contact with \n2HO  and 2O, the zinc (or other \nactive metal) is “sacrificed” (oxidized) instead of the iron. Sacrificial anodes are used underwater and underground to protect iron and steel pipes, tanks, oil rigs, and so on."

The raw materials are obtained from the different components of the natural environment. These are listed below\ny From the atmosphere: The earth’s atmosphere has approximately 5 × 10\n15\ntons of gases. It is composed of different gases namely N2 , O2 , CO2, Ne,  Ar, Kr \nand Xe. They are important industrial raw materials. Thus, the natural supply of these gases is unlimited.\ny From the hydrosphere: Ocean water which amounts to about 1.5 × 10\n21 liters \ncontains about 3.5 percent by mass dissolved material. Seawater is a good source of sodium chloride, magnesium and bromine.\ny From the lithosphere: The vast majority of elements are obtained from the earth’s crust in the form of mineral ores, carbon and hydrocarbons. Coal, natural gas and crude petroleum besides being energy sources are also converted to thousands of chemicals.\ny From the biosphere: Vegetation and animals contribute raw materials to the \nso-called agro-based industries. Oils, fats, waxes, resins, sugar, natural fibres and leather are examples of thousands of natural products.\nClassification of Natural Resources\nNatural resources can be classified as renewable and non-renewable resources. \nRenewable resources: The resources that can be replenished through rapid natural \ncycles are known as renewable resources. These resources are able to increase their abundance through reproduction and utilization of simple substances. Examples of renewable resources are plants, (crops and forests) and animals which are being replaced from time to time because they have the power to reproduce and maintain life cycles. There are also renewable resources without any life cycle. These include wood and wood-products, natural rubber, fibers (e.g.; cotton, jute, animal wool, silk,  and synthetic fibers), pulp products, and leather. Furthermore, resources, water, and soil are also classified as renewable resources.  Moreover, solar energy is considered a renewable resource as much as solar stocks are inexhaustible on the human scale."

So, the principal commercial method of production of ammonia is the Haber \nprocess, the direct combination of nitrogen and hydrogen under high pressure in the presence of a catalyst.The Haber process  was found by the German chemist, Fritz Haber, in the early \n20\nthcentury. It involved the practical use of atmospheric hydrogen and nitrogen to \nproduce ammonia. Carl Bosch was tasked with scaling up the process to an industrial production. The efforts of both these men were recognized in the form of Nobel prizes that were awarded to them in 1918 and 1931, respectively. This also led to the process being called the Haber-Bosch process. Presently, about 454 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers are produced using the Haber-Bosch process. They are extensively used to increase crop yields."

H2was initially obtained by electrolyzing water, thus, \nsplitting the water molecule into its components – hydrogen and oxygen. In \nrecent times, this method has been replaced by the use of methane as a source. Methane is easily acquired from natural gas, and requires very less external energy to produce hydrogen. The other substrate, nitrogen, is obtained by carrying out fractional distillation of air. \n Step 2: The hydrogen and nitrogen are then, introduced into a chamber containing \niron particles or lined internally with iron, and a pressure of 15 – 25 MPa at a temperature of 300 – 500 °C is applied to the gases. These conditions cause the gases to react and produce ammonia, and the following reaction occurs:\n                                          \n22 3  3   2N H NH+→                                    \nStep 3: The hot mixture of gases is then passed through a condenser. Since ammonia \ncondenses easily as compared to nitrogen and hydrogen, the liquefied ammonia is collected and removed, and the leftover nitrogen and hydrogen gases are re-introduced into the reactor. Thus, pressure is maintained, and there is no loss or wastage of reactants. This recycling of the raw materials allows a 97% conversion of initial reactants into ammonia, which is, then, used to produce a variety of products. The steps are shown in Figure 3.2.\nLeftover H2 + N2\nCoolant\nCatalyst ReactorH2 + N2\nNH3 ammonia\nCondesner\n   Figure 3.2: production of NH3 using Haber-Bosch process"

Nitric acid forms a large number of salts, called nitrates, which are typically very soluble in water. Nitric Acid is a highly corrosive mineral acid. Nitric acid and its salts are strong oxidizing agents, particularly when it is hot and concentrated. This fact explains the violence of the reactions with metals, which result in the release of hydrogen. It reacts readily with numerous substances and produces heat when dissolved in water. A significant proportion of reactions involving it are even explosive.\nConcentrated nitric acid is highly hazardous to health.

In addition, HNO\n3can \nbe used for soil acidification in horticulture.  In the chemical industry, nitric acid is primarily a precursor to organic nitrogen compounds, such as nitrobenzenes. When combined with aromatic compounds, it yields substances used to make explosives such as TNT and nitroglycerine."

Pure H\n2SO4 melts at 10.5 °C and \nboils at 338 °C. It is soluble in all ratios with water. This chemical is highly corrosive, reactive and soluble in water.   The sulphuric acid can be diluted by water to get acids in various strengths for different purposes. During the mixing process, sulphuric acid should be added to water, not the other way around. Since the dissolution of sulfuric acid in water is very exothermic i.e. a large amount of heat is released and the solution may even boil. It has a very high oxidizing power and thus, acts as a strong oxidizing and dehydrating agent. It can oxidize both metals as well as non-metals. Moreover, it itself reduces to sulphur dioxide.Example\n24 4 22   2   Cu H SO CuSO SO H O ++ → +\n24 222 2    2  2H SO C SO CO H O +→ + +\n33.5 % sulphuric acid commonly called battery acid while 62.18 sulphuric acid is known as chamber acid used for production of fertlizers"

List the similarities and differences between pottery and Ceramics. \n3.Prepare a list of ceramics products used in daily life.  \nCeramic is an inorganic, non-metallic solid prepared by the action of heat and subsequent cooling. Traditional ceramics, such as porcelain, tiles, and pottery are formed from minerals such as clay, talc and feldspar. Most industrial ceramics, however, are formed from extremely pure powders of specialty chemicals, such as silicon carbide, alumina, barium titanate, and titanium carbide.\nThe minerals used to make ceramics are dug out of the earth and are then crushed \nand ground into a fine powder. Manufacturers often purify this powder by mixing it in a solution and allowing a chemical precipitate (a uniform solid that forms within a solution) to form. The precipitate is then separated from the solution. The powder is heated to drive off impurities including water.\nThe steps of manufacturing ceramics include:\nA.Moulding: After purification, small amounts of wax are often added to bind the ceramic powder and make it more workable. Plastics may also be added to the \npowder to give the desired pliability and softness. The powder can be shaped into different objects by various moulding processes. \nB.Densification: The process of densification uses intense heat to condense a \nceramic object  into a strong, dense product. After being moulded, the ceramic object is heated in an electric furnace to temperatures between 1000 °C and 1700 °C. As the ceramic heats, the powder particles coalesce, much as water droplets join at room temperature. As the ceramic particles merge, the object becomes increasingly dense, shrinking by up to 20 percent of its original size."

Limestone is the major ingredient for the production of cement. It is abundantly available in Africa. Ethiopia has huge amounts of reserve raw materials. \nManufacturing Process \nCement is made by heating limestone (chalk), alumina (Al2O3) and silica-bearing \nmaterials such as clay to 1450 °C in a kiln. This process is known as calcination. Calcination results a hard substance called clinker. The clinker is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder. The resulting cement is known as Ordinary Portland cement (OPC). When gypsum is included in the process, cement known as Portland cement is produced. Portland cement was first discovered in England. On setting, it hardens to a stone-like mass and was compared to the famous Portland Rock of England."

Native to tropical and \nsubtropical regions of the world, this tropical grass is about 3 meters tall. And it is used commonly as raw material for production of sugar.\nPlanting: Sugarcane is planted in fields by workers or mechanical planters. Typical \ncane soil is made from the mixture of silts, clay particles and organic matter. Fertilizers \nare applied from the time of planting up until the beginning of the ripening period, depending on the region where the crop is planted. Cane seasons last from 8-22 months.\nSteps involved in sugar production:\n1. Collecting the Harvest: Mature canes are gathered by a combination of manual \nand mechanical methods. The cane is cut at ground level, the leaves are removed, the top is trimmed off (by cutting off the last mature joint) the canes and transported to a sugar factory. \n2. Cleansing and Grinding: The stalks are thoroughly washed and cut at the sugar \nmill. After the cleaning process, a machine led by a series of rotating knives, shreds the \ncane into pieces. This is known as “grinding”. During grinding, hot water is sprayed onto the sugarcane to dissolve the remaining hard sugar. The shredded cane is then spread out on a conveyer belt. \n3.

The juice is then pushed through a series of filters to remove any remaining impurities. \n5. Evaporation: The clear juice that results from the clarifying process is put under \na vacuum where the juice boils at a low temperature and the water in it begins to \nevaporate. It is heated until it forms into thick, brown syrup.\n 6. Crystallization: Crystallization is the process of evaporating the water from \nthe sugar syrup. Pulverized sugar is fed into a sterilized vacuum pan. As the liquid \nevaporates, crystals form. The remaining mixture is a thick mass of large crystals. These crystals are sent to a centrifuge that spins and dries them. The dried product is raw sugar, which is edible. \n7. Refinery: Raw sugar is transported to a cane sugar refinery for the removal of \nmolasses, minerals and other non-sugars that contaminate it. This is known as the \npurification process. Raw sugar is mixed with a solution of sugar and water to loosen the molasses from the outside of the raw sugar crystals, producing a thick matter known as “magma”. Large machines then spin the magma, separating the molasses from the crystals. The crystals are promptly washed, dissolved and filtered to remove impurities. The golden syrup that is produced is then sent through filters, and SO\n2 is \npassed through it to remove the colour and water. The process of removing colour is known as bleaching.

Comment. \n2.Some papers are cheap while others are expensive. What could be the reason?   \nDo you know what this textbook is made of?\nPaper is not a chemical compound which can be expressed by a chemical formula. \nPaper is a mixture made from rags and wood pulp glued together with some additives, bleached and dried. Wood pulp is a dry fibrous material. The timber resources used to make wood pulp are referred to as pulp wood. Wood pulp is made from soft-wood trees, such as spruce, pine, fir, larch and hemlock, and from hard woods, such as eucalyptus, aspen and birch. Wood is composed of cellulose, lignin, oils and resins. Lignin is used to bind fibres of cellulose together. To provide wood pulp, the cellulose  must be separated  from the lignin.\nManufacturing of pulp and paper involves the following steps:\n1.Harvesting: trees involves the cutting down of trees from their growing areas and \ntransporting the timber to the paper and pulp industry. \n2.Preparation: for pulping is a step in which the bark of the tree is removed and then the wood is chipped and screened to provide uniform sized chips (pieces). \n3.Pulping is a step used to make wood pulp from the chipped wood pieces. This \ncan be accomplished by   either mechanical or chemical means depending on the strength and grade of paper to be manufactured. A.Mechanical pulping: It utilizes steam, pressure and high temperatures instead \nof chemicals to tear the fibres. The fibre quality is greatly reduced because mechanical pulping creates short, weak fibres that still contain the lignin that bonds the fibres together. Paper used for newspapers are a typical product of mechanical pulping."

Chemical pulp is manufactured using the Kraft process or the Sulphite Process. \nI.The Kraft Process is the dominant chemical pulping method. It is the most \nwidely used method for making pulp from all types of trees. The process uses aqueous sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphide as a digestion solution. After digestion for about four hours at a temperature of 170 ℃, the pulp is separated by filtration. This process uses a basic digestion medium. \nII.The Sulphite Process uses a cooking liquor (digestion) solution of sodium bisulphate or magnesium bisulphate digester at pH of about 3 in a pulp. The action of the hydrogen sulphide ions at 60 ℃ over 6 to 12 hours dissolves the lignin and separates it from the cellulose. After the process is complete, the pulp is recovered by filtration. The wood pulp achieved from the Sulphite or Kraft processes is washed to remove chemicals and passed through a series of screens to remove foreign materials\n4.Bleaching: It is the process of removing colouring matter from wood pulp and \nincreasing its brightness. The most common bleaching agents are strong oxidizing agents such as chlorine, chlorine oxide, ozone and hydrogen peroxide. \n5.Making paper from pulp: After bleaching, the pulp is processed into liquid \nstock that can be transferred to a paper mill. The suspension is poured onto a continuously moving screen belt and the liquor is allowed to seep away by gravity to produce paper sheet. The continuous sheet then moves through additional rollers that compress the fibres and remove the residual water to produce fine paper."

Leather is a durable and ﬂexible material created by the tanning of animal hides and skin. Tannin is an acidic chemical that permanently alters the protein structure of a skin so that it can never return to raw hide or skin again. \nLeather production involves various preparatory stages, tanning, and crusting:  \n1.Preparatory stages are those in which the hide or skin is prepared for tanning. \nThis stage includes curing, soaking, ﬂesh removal, hair removal, scudding, and deliming.\na)Curing: This process involves salting or drying the hide once it has been \nremoved from the animal. Curing is employed to prevent putrefaction of the protein substance, collagen, from bacterial infection. Curing also removes excess water from the hide and skin. Brine curing is the simplest and fastest method. \nb)Soaking: In this process, cured hides are soaked in water for several hours \nto several days to remove salt, dirt, debris, blood and excess animal fat from the skin. \nc)Flesh removal: In this process, animal hides are moved through a machine \nthat strips the ﬂesh from the surface of the hide."

This process is called liming. It loosens the hair from the skin and makes hair-removal easier. After 1–10 days soaking, the hair is mechanically removed from the hide by a hair-removing machine.\ne)Scudding: This is the process in which hair and fat missed by the machines \nare removed from the hide with a plastic tool or dull knife. \nf)Deliming: This process involves the removal of lime from the skin or hides \nin a vat of acid.

There are two main types of tanning: \na)Vegetable or natural tanning: The skin is placed in a solution of tannin. Tannins occur naturally in the barks and leaves of many plants. The primary barks used in modern times are chestnut, oak, tanoak, hemlock, quebracho, mangrove, wattle (acacia) and myrobalan. Naturally tanned hide is ﬂexible and is used for making shoes, luggage and furniture. \nb)Mineral tanning: In this process, the skin is placed in solutions of chemicals such as chromium sulphate and other salts of chromium. Chrome tanning is faster than natural (vegetable) tanning and requires only twenty four hours. The leather is greenish-blue in colour derived from the chromium. This process produces stretchable leather that is used for making garments and handbags. \n3.Crusting: This is the final stage in leather manufacturing and includes dyeing, \nrolling the leather to make it strong, stretching it in a heat-controlled room and performing a process that involves covering the grain surface with chemical compounds such as wax, oil, glazes etc. to make the leather very attractive."

The bread is broken down into small pieces, mixed with the already prepared starter and left to stand to ferment for a couple of days (5 to 10 days). After it is fully fermented, a proportional amount of water is added to liquidity the tick dough-like mixture and left for 1 to 2 days for further fermentation. Finally, the liquid mixture is boiled and distilled in the traditional ways as depicted in Figure 3.18.  The distillate is called “Araki”. While the leftover residue or \nthe un-distilled component is locally called “ Atela” and it is usually used to feed cattle. \nFigure 3.18: Preparation of Local Araki"

List them and discuss the raw materials that are used to manufacture soaps?      \nSoaps \nOrganic chemicals are used for the synthesis of soaps. For example, animal fat and vegetable oils are used for manufacturing soap. Fats and oils are naturally occurring esters of glycerol and the higher fatty acids. Soaps are substances used to remove dirt. They are also called surfactants or surface-active agents. This is because they reduce the surface tension of water and change the surface properties. \nSoaps are either sodium or potassium salts of higher (long-chain) carboxylic acids. \nSoaps that are sodium salts are called hard soaps and those that are potassium salts are soft soaps. Soaps are prepared by boiling animal fat or vegetable oil with a base. The reaction that produces soap is called saponification."

It follows that this term applies to giant molecules built up of large numbers of interconnected repeating units. A polymer is a large chainlike molecule built up from many repeating smaller molecules. \nA polymer is generally comprised of more than 100 monomers; structures with lower \nnumbers of monomers are known as oligomers. These polymers or oligomers may be \nlinear, slightly branched, or highly interconnected. In the branched case the structure develops into a large three-dimensional network. With few exceptions, the repeat unit in the polymer usually corresponds to the monomer from which the polymer was made. The size of a polymer molecule may be defined either by its mass or by the number of repeat units in the molecule. This latter indicator of size is called the degree \nof polymerization, DP. The relative molar mass of the polymer is thus the product of \nthe relative molar mass of the repeat unit and the DP ."

These products are normally referred to as condensate. This polymerization is also known as step growth polymerization. In order to produce a condensation polymer, the monomers involved two or more functional groups.  Typically, such reactions take place between reactive components, such as dibasic acids with diamines to give polyamides, or dibasic acids with diols to form polyesters. Proteins, starch and cellulose are examples of natural condensation polymers. Whereas, Polyester (Polyethylene terephthalate or Dacron) and the polyamide Nylon 66 represented below, are two examples of synthetic condensation polymers.\nThey can be produced by the condensation reaction of diacids and diamines. One \nof the most common polyamides is nylon 66 or nylon. It is a copolymer and is prepared by the condensation of 1, 6-diaminohexane (hexamethylene diamine) and 1,6-hexanedioic acid (adipic acid). The basic amine reacts with the acid to form a salt. Heating removes water and forms the amide bonds.\nDacron is a copolymer and is formed when equimolar amounts of 1, 4-benzene \ndicarboxylic acid (terephthalic acid) and 1, 2-ethanediol (ethylene glycol) react.\nHO CO\n(CH 2)4CO\nOH +nH2N (CH 2)6NH2n\nAdipic acid Hexamethylene diamine\nHeat\nHO CO\n(CH 2)4CO\nn NH (CH 2)6NH H+(2n- 1)H2On"

A pollutant is any substance that changes air, water or any other natural resource in a way that impairs the use of the resource. Pollutants are discharged into the environment as a result of natural events (like a volcanic eruption) and as a result of human activities (such as the operation of chemical industries, agriculture, etc.). Pollutants can be classified by the type of pollution they cause: air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution.\n5.2.1 Air Pollution\nActivity 5.6\n1.Based on the situation of your locality, discuss the following issues in groups and present the findings to the class: a.Explore some human activities which contribute to air pollution. \nb.How do these activities contribute to air pollution?\nc.What solutions do you recommend to overcome these      problems? \nd.What could be your contribution to reduce air pollutions?\n2.Give your suggestions on the statement, ‘ Air pollution anywhere is a potential threat elsewhere.’\nAtmosphere is considered as solution.

Some common air pollutants are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, ozone, hydrocarbons, particulates, chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs), and lead compounds. \nSulphur dioxide ( SO\n2 ): -This enters the atmospheric air from the combustion of \ncoal and petroleum, and during extraction of metals from their sulphide ores. It causes \ncoughing, chest pains and shortness of breath.  It is thought to be a cause for bronchitis and lung diseases. It slowly oxidizes to SO\n3 by reacting with the oxygen in the air. \nOxides of nitrogen: - These can be formed in the atmosphere by natural processes \nlike thunderstorms. Combustion of fossil fuel containing nitrogen compounds as impurities and exhaust gases from furnaces and engines increase the amount of nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO\n2, in the atmosphere. Nitric oxide, NO, catalyzes \nthe decomposition of ozone in the upper layer of the atmosphere to oxygen, thus decreasing the ozone layer:\n( ) ( )322     3NOOg Og  →\nNitric oxide is oxidized by oxygen to nitrogen dioxide in the presence of ultraviolet light:\n( ) ( ) ( )22 2   2NO g O g NO g +→\nSO2, SO3 and NO2 react with rainwater and form sulphurous acid (H2SO3), sulphuric \nacid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), respectively and cause acid rain. Acid rain \naccelerates corrosion and the deterioration of metals, buildings, statues and also causes tree defoliation, release of heavy metal ions from soil into water courses and drop in the pH of water in rivers and lakes. \nHydrocarbons and ozone are responsible for photochemical smog. It is characterized \nby a reddish-brown haze containing substances irritating to the eye, nose, and lungs, and causes extensive damage to vegetation. Considerable amounts of hydrocarbons are released into the atmosphere by the evaporation of gasoline as un burnt hydrocarbons in auto exhaust. These substances react with ozone to give compounds that contribute to the oxidizing nature of photochemical smog."

Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide impairs \nvision, produces headaches, and exerts strain on the heart. It also reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood by reacting with hemoglobin. \nParticulates: - Dust storms, forest fires, volcanic eruptions and human activities such \nas mining and burning coal and oil increase the amount of solid particles in the air. \nIndustrial areas contain particles of limestone, fertilizers, coal, stones, cement and silica. These particulates irritate the lungs and deleteriously affect breathing. \nChlorofluorocarbons(CFCs):- Chloroﬂuorocarbons are used as refrigerants, solvents \nand plastic foam-blowing agents.

The \nincrease in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has resulted in a rise in the \naverage global temperature, owing to the greenhouse effect.

Due to the absorption of heat by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the overall effect is global warming (an increase in the average temperature of our planet). This rise in global temperature causes melting of polar ice and thus additional water ﬂowing into the oceans. This situation, in turn, results in the rising of the levels of seas and oceans, ﬂooding of coastlines and lowland areas, which can submerge these areas. \nHeavy metals: Lead contamination in the atmosphere is a result of vehicle engines \nthat use fuels containing tetraethyl lead which is added to the fuel to reduce engine \nknocking.

In general, water is said to be polluted if it contains matter that affects the health of living things or causes damage to property. The major water pollutants are nitrate and phosphate fertilizers washed out of the soil, phosphate detergents, untreated sewage, insecticides and herbicides, and the heavy metal ion, acidic and/or basic residues released by industrial processes. Phosphate and nitrate fertilizers washed out of the soil and phosphate detergents from untreated water, enter natural water systems, such as streams, rivers, lakes, and seas. These dissolved minerals are valuable nutrients for plants, and their discharge into the water systems accelerates the growth of surface-water plants, such as algae.As a result, less light reaches the bottom-living plants, which reduces the photosynthesis they need to live, and they die. When these aquatic plants die, they rot under the action of bacteria which multiply greatly and consume the oxygen dissolved in the water at a rate faster than natural aeration or photosynthesis can replenish."

Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO\n2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), ozone (O3), water vapor (H2O) and \nﬂuorinated gases. These gases warm our planet by absorbing infrared (IR) light radiation that would otherwise escape into space. Without this warming effect (called the greenhouse effect), the average temperature on Earth would be a chilly 255 K (that’s -18\noC, or the temperature on an extremely cold winter day). Because these \ngreenhouse gases in our atmosphere absorb IR light, Earth’s average temperature is 288 K (that’s 15\noC, about the temperature on a slightly cool spring day). Thus, Earth \nis 33 K warmer than what would be expected if there was no the greenhouse effect.  \nFor example, CO2 (g)and H2O (g) do absorb IR light and upon doing so gain energy \nwhich is transferred to the rest of the Earth.

On the other hand, both N\n2(g)and O2 (g)are present in very large amounts in the atmosphere, these gases do \nnot absorb IR light and therefore do not contribute to the greenhouse effect."

Green chemistry asks the question: “Why generate pollution if there is a greener alternative?” \nDeveloping a green alternative begins with considering the hazards of the required \nchemicals as well as their properties. Chemists then develop a manufacturing process so that every stage of product development is environmentally safe—from the raw materials to what happens to the product at the end of its useful life. In other words, the process is “benign by design.” \nA green chemistry solution may involve using safer chemicals. Liquid carbon dioxide, \nfor example, is starting to replace toxic organic solvents used in dry cleaning. Greening a chemical process can also involve making a process more efficient.

Generally, it describes the ability to update chemical transformations in order to limit the generation of hazardous waste as a significant advancement towards contamination or pollution avoidance.\nBy preventing waste generation, the risks associated with waste storage, transportation, \nand treatment could be limited.

The idea of the atom \neconomy is to improve chemical processes, by avoiding the waste of atoms from reactants to products. Atom economy can be assessed easily by calculating the number of atoms in the Chemical Reaction.

This modification should be reﬂected up to the molecular level of the chemical’s design. \n5.Safer Solvent and Auxiliaries\nMost of the industries from polymer to pharmaceutical industries and other chemical allied industries use solvents at some point in their manufacturing. In general, the use of solvents should be avoided, but that is not possible in all cases. So we can possibly replace toxic, non-recyclable solvents with safer and innocuous solvents."

Processes should be carried out at ambient conditions that means run chemical reactions at room temperature and pressure whenever possible. Some ways in which this can be achieved are well-maintained equipment in plants, recovery of waste heat, and removal of solvents, proper utilization of catalysts, and combined heat and power (CHP).\n7.Use of Renewable Feedstock\nUse starting materials (also known as feedstock’s) that are renewable rather than depletable. The source of renewable feedstocks is often agricultural products or the wastes of other processes; the source of depletable feedstock’s is often fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, or coal) or mining operations.\n8.Reduce Derivatives\nIn this principle, “the reaction takes place at a particular functional group blocking unnecessary waste generation “by reducing the process steps with the use of enzymes, catalysts, or solvent, therefore, reducing demand for feedstock and utilities required for down-streaming hence increasing overall economy and efficiency of the process.\nFor example, the synthesis of the common nonprescription pain medication, ibuprofen, \nnicely illustrates the success of a green chemistry approach (see Figure 5.9 ). First marketed in the early 1960s, ibuprofen was produced using a six-step synthesis that required 514 g of reactants to generate each mole (206 g) of ibuprofen, an atom economy of 40%. In the 1990s, an alternative process was developed by the BHC Company (now BASF Corporation) that requires only three steps and has an atom economy of ~80%, nearly twice that of the original process. The BHC process generates significantly less chemical waste; uses less-hazardous and recyclable materials; and provides significant cost-savings to the manufacturer (and, subsequently, the consumer). In recognition of the positive environmental impact of the BHC process, the company received the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greener Synthetic Pathways Award in 1997."

Enzymes are Biocatalysts which are natural substances derived from biological sources, are renewable and Biodegradable.Catalysis can help us build a more sustainable world and can play a major role to mitigate the global environmental impacts of unsustainable chemical processes.\n10. Design for Degradation\nThis principle stands for, “Chemical products should be designed so that at the end of their function they break down into innocuous degradation products and do not persist in the environment”. That means during the usage of chemicals it should be stable and do not persist the environment but after usage, it should be degraded into small molecules that are not harmful to the environment and humans.\nFigure 5.10: Simple illustration of biodegradable product"

It is better to see atom economy in detail with illustrative example below: \nAtom economy: The atom economy (a measure of atom utilization or efficiency) \nis a measure of the amount of starting materials that end up as useful products. It is important for sustainable development and for good economic reasons to use reactions with high atom economy. A chemical reaction may give, and often does, more than one product, but of the mixture of products, perhaps only one of them is the desired useful product. The percentage atom economy of a reaction is readily calculated using the balanced equation for the reaction expressed in reacting masses.The atom economy of a reaction is a theoretical percentage measure of the amount of starting materials that ends up as the ‘desired’ useful reaction products. It’s sometimes referred to as atom utilization.\nMass of  desired  or useful productAtom economy 100  * Total mass of  all reactants or products=\nIn atom economy calculations you can say reactants or products because of the law of conservation of mass. The greater the % atom economy of a reaction, the more ‘efficient’ or ‘economic’ it is likely to be. Many reactions give more than one product, and not all of them are useful, so it is useful to calculate what % of the products is theoretically useful, and we call this the atom economy of the reaction. The reactions that only give one product, have the maximum atom economy of 100% and these are the most economic reactions e.g. synthesis of ammonia and reacting ethene with water to make ethanol.\n22 3 2 2 2 32 3 2     N H NH and CH CH H O CH CH OH+ = +→ "
