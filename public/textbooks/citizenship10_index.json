In this case, the word democracy implies the idea of rule by the people or government by the people. On the other hand, the dictionary definition of the term entails that democracy is a state of government in which people hold the ruling power either directly or indirectly through their elected representatives.\nAccordingly, democracy embraces the principles of equality, individual freedom \nand opportunity for the common people, as those who actually wield political power. Moreover, the definition entails, among others, democratic system; state power involves compromise and bargaining in decision- making process in a democratic system.\nActivity 1.1\n1.

When defined in a more elaborate manner, it can be understood as a political process that moves the political system of a given country into democracy.\nDemocratization is the transition to a more democratic political regime, including \nsubstantive political changes moving in a democratic direction. It may be the transition from an authoritarian regime to a full democracy, a transition from an authoritarian political system to a semi-democracy or a transition from a semi-authoritarian political system to a democratic political system. It is ‘the transition to a more democratic system of government.’ 22\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to: ☑Define actors of democratization process\n ☑Identify actors in the process of democratization"

Thus, in this section you will look at the role of different actors in the democratization process.\nPolitical parties\nPolitical parties are vectors of democracy.

They differ from political parties only in their final goal, but they all contribute to consciousness raising, defense of the legitimate interests of groups of individuals and the protection of individual and collective rights and freedoms. The efficiency of the work of civil society depends on the extent to which such associations are autonomous or institutionalized.\nInterest groups \nInterest groups are organizations or groups of people, which are autonomous from government or political parties with the objective of influencing government. In democracies we find several interest groups who attempt to promote and influence the policies of government. In fact, interest groups are regarded as essential transmission belts between people and government. They play an important role in helping people interact with government, which is often remote and difficult for the individual to influence. Interest groups, bridge the gap between the citizen and government. Through interest groups, citizens communicate their wants on policy goals to government leaders.\nBrainstorming\n 偮What do you understand by interest groups?"

It includes newspapers, television, radio, books, posters, magazines, cinema, etc. Media plays a role in the political training of citizens and in building democratic culture. But, to perform those functions, it must be free and independent; it must have sufficient material and human resources to deal with all the important problems of the society.

The role of democracy for social \ntransformation\nSocial transformation is the process by which an individual alters the socially \nascribed social status of his/her parents into a socially achieved status for him/herself \n(status transformation). Another definition refers to a large-scale social change as in \ncultural reforms or transformations (societal transformation). The first one applies \nto an individual, while  the second applies to the social system.\nSocial transformation is also the restructuring of all aspects of life; from culture to \nsocial relations; from politics to economy; from the way we think to the way we live. \nThrough time, societies have transformed from small associations of individuals tied together by instincts, need, and fear, to small communities tied together by \ncircumstances, kinship, traditions, and religious beliefs, to nations tied together by \nhistory, politics, ideology, culture, and laws. But for most of human history, the pace of change was very slow; no transformations in life conditions could be felt \nfor several generations. Therefore, democracy can play a significant role for social \ntransformation but the process of transformation may be manifested in the following ways:44\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to: ☑Describe the dimensions of social transformation\n ☑Explain the role of democracy for social transformation\nBrainstorming\n 偮What are the roles of democracy for social transformation?"

Acknowledging that social change must start with the individual, social justice.\nb) Civic engagement\nCivic engagement refers to the many ways in which people participate in civic, community, and political life and, by doing so, express their engaged citizenship. It ranges from proactively becoming better informed to participating in public dialogue on issues, from volunteering to voting and community organizing to political advocacy. The defining characteristic of active civic engagement is commitment to participate and contribute to the improvement of one’s community, neighborhood, and nation.

Engaging in civic dialogue is a form of civic engagement. Sometimes civic or public dialogue is considered an important end in itself. In this context, dialogue is defined as two or more parties with differing viewpoints working toward common understanding in an open-ended, most often, face-to-face format. In dialogue, multiple and possibly conflicting perspectives are included rather than promoting a single point of view. Empathy and understanding are promoted. Assumptions are brought out into the open. Suspension of judgment is encouraged in order to foster understanding and break down obstacles.  \nd) Social capital\nThe building of social capital is a common outcome named in arts and social change work. Social capital is the collective value of all “social networks” (who people know) and the inclinations to do things for each other that arise from these networks. Specific benefits that flow from social networks include trust, reciprocity, information, and cooperation. Bonding networks that connect people who are similar sustain particularized (in-group) reciprocity. Bridging networks that connect individuals who are diverse sustain generalized reciprocity. \nBrainstorming\n 偮What is social capital?"

Organizations, they may also aim to advance youth development, health, recreation, human service, cultural, and other community goals. Community development seeks to empower individuals and groups of people by providing these groups with the skills and resources they need to effect change in their own communities.\nBrainstorming\n 偮What is community development?"

These are values of liberty/freedom, justice and equality. Let us now briefly look at what each of them means.\n• Liberty: This value includes personal freedom (to mean that Individuals should be free from arbitrary arrest and detention and also their homes/property should be secured from unreasonable searches and seizures), political freedom ( to imply that people of a nation have the right to participate freely in the political process such as elections without being subject to arbitrary arrest, harassment and electoral corruption such as buying votes, intimidation and obstruction of voter) and economic freedom ( to mean that citizens should have the right to acquire, use, transfer and dispose of private property without unreasonable governmental interference and more over to enjoy right to seek employment wherever one pleases, to change employment at will and to engage in any lawful labor unions or business corporations). \n• Justice: This value of democracy can be understood in three general senses of fairness. These are distributive Justice (the sense of distributing benefits and burdens in society via agreed up on standards of fairness), corrective Justice (the sense that a proportional response should be in place to correct wrongs and injuries) and procedural justice (the idea that procedures used for gathering information and making decisions should be guided by such principles as impartiality and openness of proceedings). \n• Equality: Three notions of equality are of particular significance here for our discussion. These are political equality (implying that all people who attain the status of adult hood have equal political rights or in short one man-one vote- one value), social equality (implying that there should be no social hierarchy at individual and collective level or no discrimination what so ever) and economic equality (implying that all peoples of a country deserve equal and fair assessment to the national resources services)."

Economic democracy recognizes the right to work, leisure, fair wages, and unrestricted right to the enjoyment of life. \n3. Political aspect of democracy: The political aspect of democracy signifies the provision of political rights namely the right to vote, the right to contest during elections, the right to hold public office, the right to movement, thought, association, the right to freedom of conscience, the right to speak, etc. In order to enable citizens to exercise these and other political rights effectively and persistently, citizens have to be asserted freedom of speech, association and publication. Democracy is, therefore, a social balance, and the dominant ideas of the purpose of democracy at any particular time represent the balance of interest.\nUnit summary\nThere is no absolute definition of democracy. The term is elastic and expands and contracts according to the time, place and circumstances of its use. What follows is a short list of definitions provided by field experts.\nThe word democracy was derived from two Greek words: demos and kratos, which \nmeans common people and rule (legitimate power to rule), respectively. In this case, the word democracy implies to the idea of rule by the people or government by the people.\nDemocratic institutions are important to develop and protect democracy. These \ninstitutions must serve the entire population of a country with equality under the law. Autocratic and oligarchic governments might have the rule of law but do not qualify for democracy because they fail to fully ensure equality under the law .\nSocial transformation is the process by which an individual alters the socially ascribed social status of his/her parents into a socially achieved status for him/herself but the process of transformation may be manifested in the following ways: social change, Civic engagement, Civic dialogue, social capital, community development etc. ..."

Digital technology has the ability to change a user’s mental and emotional state. It affects how people feel and behave, allows to be better related to others and achieve goals. It also shapes the way societies and people behave, grow, evolve and develop both within people's lives and in their relations with others. We cannot ignore the fact that the social bond that we humans share is affected by the technology advancements. Digital technology can lead to both positive and negative emotions conditioned on how often people use technology and for what purpose. Moderate use of digital technology produces positive effects, whereas excessive, obsessive, or addictive use typically leads to negative effects. Let us discuss both positive and negative effects of digital technology on the emotions of citizens.\nBrainstorming\n 偮How do digital technologies affect people's emotions?"

In such relationships, face-to-face communications may lead to uncontrolled emotional aggression between the worker and the manager. Digital technology enables workers and managers not to meet face- to- face, since technologies provide new arrangements between work and personal time and space. For example, internet enabled arrangements, such as working at home and mobile office, being on call, and being able to monitor and check work related information away from the office are all praised as solutions. These arrangements help people to shape emotions, enable people to control their anger.\nSince affection has a bodily foundation and it is more difficult to control emotions \nin the face- to-face interaction, the absence of both factors might lead one to believe that digital realm is emotional colder, and that it impairs or restricts the expression of emotions. When digital interactions are through videos mutual facial recognition, expression and interpretation of emotions become at least easier ."

Social media, for example, is a place where people can connect socially and engage in kind and helpful behavior - activities that have been shown to boost health and wellbeing. For example, sending message on social media, people can express a kind of word or share people gratitude. For the young with symptoms of depression, social media is very important in helping them express themselves creatively, get inspiration from others, and even feel less depressed. Comparing ourselves to the seemingly perfect lives of friends and people we follow, social media seems to be beneficial.\nRegulating emotions\nTechnology has given people access to lots of health and wellness resources making it easier than ever to build and practice skills like gratitude, mindfulness and regulating emotions. Good use of digital technology can teach people the skills they need to optimize their wellbeing, help them stay motivated to do so, and even benefit their mental health. For example, computer based training in emotion regulation can improved anxiety and wellbeing among those who had trouble regulating their emotions, suggesting that skills that can regulate emotions can be learned. Since technologies allow a remarkably accelerating accumulation of thoughts, people can learn and respect fundamental behavioral principles of emotion regulation.\nProviding a sense of security\nTechnologies, for example, mobile phones, give people a sense of security when they are in a public space. It’s potential to access known others like the police means that the device is viewed as a more effective weapon of self-confidence.\nSelf-reflection activity\n 偮 Do you agree that using mobile phones gives a sense of security to the \nusers?"

People with higher social media use are more likely to feel socially isolated than those who do not use social media often. \nSecondhand living\nOn the internet people create imaginary identities in virtual worlds and spend hours playing out parallel lives. People are increasingly preoccupied with the virtual realities. People in chat rooms blur the boundaries between their on-lives and off-lives, and there is every indication that the future will include robots that seem to express feelings and moods. All these change human identities from real life to artificial life. Music concerts or live shows are videoed on mobile phones, events are photographed, and audio is recorded. Media is uploaded on to social sites. Life becomes something that is experienced through the prism of digital media rather than firsthand.\nDepression and anxiety\nThere is a link between social network and mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Many studies found out that people who had restricted social interactions and who are  more involved in social media and online interactions are more prone to higher level of depression and anxiety than those who are more involved in social interactions with other people.\nAnonymity and fake personality\nDigital technology provides wide scope for users to hide their identities. People are much more likely to behave anti-socially if they do not think that there will be any consequences. Bullying, trolling, stalking, threatening, and insulting behavior have all increased dramatically with the rise of the internet. People assume fake personas for the purpose of scamming and defrauding."

Passports contain digital chips that hold information enabling self-service machines to speed up the process of checking in and passing through customs. Road vehicles such as cars, trucks and trains can now be booked online via various applications which make people to get services faster.\nAdvancing banking and finance\nThere is no doubt that digitalization has led to a radical change in financial matters.

Transferring money between accounts both locally and internationally are conducted using digital technology.\nImproving health care\nDigital technologies have brought about a massive and welcome change to the healthcare sector. Patients now have access to some of the best diagnostic tools, new and cutting-edge treatments and less painful and quicker healings. Patients not only have access to quick and accurate medical information using their handheld devices, but they can also use applications to keep track of doctor’s appointments, and get remainder to take their medications. Since medical information or data are easily available to physicians, they can access complete medical histories of patients and make the well-considered medical decisions. Digital technology also helps enhance patient care by providing information about the patient’s vital signs, and temperature. Digital technology has enabled patients get medical treatment with specialists in any part of the world.\nPromoting economic growth\nThe current phase of economic development is characterized by an accelerated digitalization process where innovative infrastructure plays a crucial role. Digital technologies have brought about economic growth through the introduction of new innovations and infrastructures, large amount of investments, strengthening information and communication services in the global market. Moreover, they increase the volume of transit freight because of the decrease in transit time in all transportation sectors. New technologies that have been adopted in the agriculture sector, for example, satellite technologies and mobile phones significantly increased agricultural productivity by enabling the weather conditions and updating information on agricultural knowledge.The use of digital technologies in day- to -day activities dramatically increases the amount of goods and services produced in different parts of the world, the automation of business operations and operational effectiveness."

Technologies \nsuch as computers, smart phones and hand held tablets, can hold a person’s attention for long periods. This may lead to eyestrains. Symptoms of digital eyestrain can include blurred vision, and dry eyes. Eyestrain may also lead to pain in other areas of the body such as the head, neck or shoulder. The way people use mobile devices and computers may also contribute to incorrect posture. Overtime, this may leads to musculoskeletal problems.\n2.1.3.

Digital technology allows people to think and look beyond their spheres and perspectives. This means that they no longer see things from specific sources of information. While people access information from diversified sources, they are enable to analyze, check facts, and challenge the information rather than passively accept the dictums of others. People who have limited sources of information and knowledge have no choice to ignore. Rather they accept what they get as ultimate truth and fact. People using digital technologies  purposefully would acquire, enhance and develop the power, the skill and knowledge to identify and critically evaluate what is fact and what is individual’s opinion. Later they could gain new perspectives. That means, people can develop the capacity to monitor, evaluate, and control thinking while completing new tasks which help critical thinking and transfer of knowledge.\n• Developing universal moral values: people come from diversified"

People who live in isolated environment always believe their moral norms are best, but the moral norms of others are worst. When they start to communicate with others, and begin to learn more about others people, they compare and contrast the good and evil norms of the world society. Through time, such good moral norms got acceptance and become   universal moral principles.\n• Self-learning of good habits: good moral characters may not be always acquired from family and peers. The way people make moral decisions and become good may have been shaped by other persons who have good ethical behaviors. Digital technologies allow people to learn ways of acquiring good moral values from the experiences of others. For example, reading the life experiences of philosophers from different sources may help a person to learn what kind of person she/he should be and what kind of behaviors she/he should acquire. When people start to interact with others, they begin to reconsider their conceptions about what is good or bad, right or wrong, just or unjust and become aware of the broader society, its values, norms, and expectations. \nActivity 2.4\n ☑How do digital technologies contribute to developing universal \nmoral values?\nActivity 2.5\n ☑What kind of good habits do you learn from digital world?

People who access different philosophical thoughts from various digital sources may experience ethical dilemma when something at work goes against their personal ethics, morals and values. Such dilemma may force people, for example, to choose between being honest and dishonest, or between what they know is right and what they know is wrong. These dilemmas may lead people to lose or change their norms and values established in their own socio-cultural spheres.\nFigure 2.8. Negative implications of digital technology on the ethical values of citizens\n• Increasing uncertainty: in this digital world, many ethical issues are raised and discussed through internet. Different people engage in conversations and debates and  disseminate to others through webs about how to behave well or have right characters or how to lead our lives properly. For such questions, philosophers have no well-articulated answers till now. Hence, people may confront with the lives they really live, which leads them to confusion and uncertainty of their future."

Many people have lost their freedoms of writing and speech using different media because of fear of insult by people who refuse their views or opinions. \n• Induction of negative emotions: people are experiencing negative emotions, such as fear, disgust, and anger. These emotions become routine for some people when they watch a sad film, war and disastrous videos, etc. Such emotions disrupt and dislocate the thinking and attention of human beings.

Now, have a look at the common  ethical codes of using digital technologies:\nEtiquette: refers to the importance of understanding how behavior in the digital \nsphere affects others. Digital behavior makes everyone  a role model.  As new technologies emerge, users  do not have the opportunity to \"catch up\" with all of their uses. Moreover, when people see others using technologies inappropriately, they may assume it is the norm. This leads to inappropriate technology behavior on the part of people. Example of inappropriate etiquette;\n• Students use cell phones to send non-class related messages back and \nforth in class.\nResponsibility: at any early age you may find it easy to locate and download material from the Internet. Technology users must think twice about what is appropriate or ethical and legal to download materials from the internet. Examples of inappropriate responsibility.\n• Students copy materials of the internet for class projects without giving \ncredit to the author.\n• Students download illegal materials from the internet sites.\nSafety:  people need to be aware of the physical dangers that are inherent in using technology. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one (though not the only) of such dangers. Eyestrain and poor posture are common problems in technology-related activities. You should use technology in a responsible way to prevent various physical injuries. Example, using technology in rooms that are not well lit.\nSecurity:  as more and more sensitive information is stored electronically, a \ncorresponding strategy to protect that information must be created. People  must learn how to protect electronic data (example, virus protection, firewall, offsite storage). Protecting one’s equipment is not only a matter of personal responsibility but also necessary for protecting the community (example, keeping one’s virus software up to date). However, digital security goes beyond protecting equipment. It includes protecting ourselves and others from outside influences that would do us"

Example of inappropriate security: \n• Failure to protect your identity while using e-mail, chat, or instant \nmessaging\n• Failure to protect electronic data\n• Failure to maintain current software updates on other computers so as to protect from computer virus.\nConfidentiality: internet users consider privacy or security to be one of the important issues. A lot of internet users are not aware of the fact that personal information may be revealed when they go online. Examples of inappropriate confidentiality: when people tell their email, Facebook and other passwords to others. \nAccuracy/ trust worthiness: although there is a wide realm of information available \non the internet, there is no agency monitoring truth or accuracy of information. There is no restriction on false information. Teachers should inform their students about the situation to protect them from citing or reading incorrect information. Inaccurate information can cause confusion in society, and medical and legal issues. In sum, with the rise of technology use at home and in the class rooms, developing digital citizenship has been a priority in countries of the world. Ensuring children and the young people are active, engaged and respectful online users are essential to fostering digital skill development and inclusion of the non-skillful children.

It creates the opportunity \nof empowering the young generation to fully participate in today’s digital world. This would be an advantage for them to be informed citizens.   \n• Learning opportunities:  anybody with access to the internet now has an access to a huge proportion of the world’s knowledge over the web. Lessons and courses can now be delivered virtually online. Communication advances mean that the young people can now easily communicate with most of the world’s population and learn directly from sources without the need of face-to-face contact or going abroad. For example, people trying to understand foreign events, or to learn new language, thanks to digital technology, they can easily learn and acquire knowledge and skills. Digital technology enables the young to acquire short term trainings on different disciplines. Even people can develop their skills by watching videos, listening audios and searching relevant internet information regarding what they want.\n• Versatile working opportunities: due to the advancement of digital technology, the nature of work has been transformed.   Increased connectivity options means that many young people now have far more opportunities for working from home as remote working has become increasingly common. Many jobs can now be done from hundreds, or thousands of miles away without difficulty.

When \none’s work and intellectual property are simply copied, and plagiarized by others without adding their efforts, it leads to dependence on others’ work and property. When young citizen become dependent on others’ work, they become dependent and unanalytical in their academy. This unethical conduct affects not only the academic performance of people who copied, but also of those people whose work is plagiarized and copied by others, because plagiarism leads to the erosion of   authors morality, which again results in academicians leaving out the academic circle and research contribution. This in turn affects the future generation who could benefit from the work of others and who want to contribute to their people by writing books, and articles and conducting researches.\n• Digital media piracy:  this is a leading unethical practice in the use of \ncomputers. Piracy is regarded as illegal circulation and distribution of music, movies, books and other intellectual property. Such unethical acts affect the young in many ways. First, it violates the property rights of those whose music, movies, books etc... are distributed and circulated to others without payment. Secondly, such conducts affect the production industries \n Mrs. Zebenay, a Citizenship teacher, gives assignment for her students to do \nindividually within four days by referring to books in the library. However, many \nstudents directly copied the assignment from internet sources. Some students \nhave done their assignment in a better way by referring to different books and \nmaterials.

For \nexample, musicians and academicians, and film makers lose their property rights because their properties are stolen and distributed without payment. \n• Identity theft: digital technologies provide wide scopes for users to hide their identities.People are much more likely to behave anti-socially if they think that there will be no consequences.\n• Unfriendly and revenge sex: the irresponsible and unethical use of digital technology poses risks for the young in their relationships with their sexual friends. Digital technologies enable young people to share, create and forward suggestive aggressive sex videos. When the young practice like what they watch in the videos, it leads them to separate from their friends or to be addicted. Youngsters who have access of downloading and watching sex videos are prone to early sexual experiences which bring about many problems for them (effect of education, engaging in sexual relationships early, family crisis, etc.).\nUnit summary\nNow a day’s digital technologies are reaching many people of the world and transforming societies by enhancing connectivity, increasing innovations, supporting and accelerating development, creating more jobs and versatile working conditions, creating learning opportunities, facilitating, financial inclusion, giving access to trade and public services, and achieving social welfare. They affect how people feel and behave, allow to create better relation with others enabling to achieve goals. They also shape the way societies and people behave, grow, evolve and develop both within themselves and in their relations with others. A good use of digital technology also improves human moral well-being, helps be better at making ethical decisions. Although, digital technologies have made positive changes in the world, some forms of digital technologies have negatively affected people’s interaction, emotions, psychology, moral values and social fabrics. It can threaten privacy, erode ethical values, erode security, and fuel inequality, make users less loving others and worse at making ethical decisions.

However, the following elements are commonly practiced by all institutions and organizations for realization of their purposes. \n• Accountability: is a principle which requires elected and appointed government officials to be answerable for the decisions and acts they undertake. Officials must make  decisions and perform their duties according \nto the will and wishes of the people, not for themselves. For government to \nbe accountable the people must be aware of what is happening in the country.\n• Participation : refers to the involvement of citizens in the process of decision \nmaking. Every citizen has a role in the process of decision making. People \nshould be allowed to express their concerns in the policy making influencing them without any fear and discriminations.   \n• Rule of law:  good governance requires legal frame works to be fair and been \nenforced impartially It means that everyone must obey the law and be held \naccountable if he/she violates it. Impartial implementation of laws requires \nan independent judiciary and impartial and incorruptible police force.  \n• Transparency: refers to the availability of information of the general public and clarity about government rules, regulations and decisions and those \ndecisions taken and their enforcement are done in a manner that follows \nrules and regulations. Transparency is also means that information is freely available, known and directly accessible to those who will be affected by \nsuch decisions and their enforcement. Transparency in government decision \nmaking and public policy implementation reduces uncertainty and can help inhibit corruption among public official.\n• Equity and Inclusiveness:  a society’s well-being depends on ensuring that all its members feel that they have a stake in it and do not feel excluded from \nthe mainstream of society. This requires all groups, but particularly the most \nvulnerable, have opportunities to improve or maintain their well-being.\n• Responsiveness : good governance requires that institutions and processes \ntry to serve all stakeholders within a reasonable time frame. By being \nresponsive, government and non- government institutions gain legitimacy in public realm which will ensure their wider acceptance.\n• Consensus Oriented: good governance should mediate differing interests in"

The important roles that good governance has to address economic problems is through ensuring the rule of law, improving the efficiency and accountability of the public and private sector, better allocation and distribution of resources, allowing the community access to government institutions and markets and increasing growth and ensuring the development outcomes that are redistributed to all of the population. Good governance promotes inclusive growth through effective implementations of government policies and the existence of impartial institutions that make possible a fair distribution of the benefits from the economy and by protecting property rights and supporting an equitable enforcement of law for all individuals. Good governance also calls for a decentralized development and administration, which ensured the society’s participation in their own affairs. This form of governance would ensure that citizens are not just objects of development but subjects who take responsibility of their lives and their development.\n•  Improve  social development:   development does not just involve increase \nin income/ or economic growth, but also include sustainable improvements in the living standard of the society and social well-being. Good governance ensures a better today and a brighter future for all the citizens and generate a great deal of interest among the people that represent the aspirations and hopes, culture of the people. Good governance brings positive change in the quality and span of life of the people through:\n• Access to better living conditions;\n• The ability to feed, cloth, and shelter oneself resulting from more income \nin one’s means of livelihood;\n• Ability to live longer life as a result of the provision of health and medical \nfacilities and, prevention of diseases through better sanitation;\n• The ability to read, write and understand through the provision of \neducation;"

It \nalso ensures social and economic priorities are based on broad consensus in society and that the voices of the poorest and the most vulnerable are heard in decision-making over the allocation of development resources. Good governance promotes that diversified opinions are mediated in a society to develop consensus on what is practical, beneficial and in the larger interest. The desire for strong social cohesion and unity will be best served through: the promotion of democratic principles, popular participation, human rights and rule of the law, enhancing the ability of people to gain better and dignified life, and ensuring transparency in administration. Good governance along with education helps how to achieve peaceful transformation and conflict resolution. \n• Promoting peace: good governance is a key instrument for promoting peace by providing pathways for citizens to feel that their issues and  interest is represented in the decision-making structures. It also allows diversified social, political, and economic groups to engage in the decision-making process and provide for the equitable receipt of benefits and resources and offer mechanisms for all people to voice their concerns and grievances, and protecting their rights and guarantying security. When the governance system is not participatory, accountable and transparent, it is a fact that some groups feel to be excluded, which in turn contribute to instability. A country, which is democratic in its polity, is well governed if its government can simultaneously sustain legitimacy, promote socio-economic development and maintain order without coercion.  \n• Ensuring social justice: good governance encourages judicial flexibility and creativity, opening legal systems to new justice claims and to the values espoused by political and social minorities.

Challenges for good governance\nPeople in developing countries are now facing many governance challenges. Their \ngovernment institutions are not effective and responsive. Officials are unaccountable, courts are not independent, and resources are not efficiently utilized. Some of the major challenges facing developing countries are:\n• Poverty :  good governance could not be realized in a condition where people \nare poor because  poverty does not provide a fertile ground for the promotion of rights and participation. When people are starved they are concerned about where they can get meal. They do not worry about their participation in the decision-making process. Extreme poverty results in exclusion, isolation and loneliness and exacerbates   a sense of stigma and shame. This in turn creates a sense of not being able to join in the society or play any part in it. Effective governance is difficult to attain when those people affected by poverty have 44\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to: ☑Recognize challenges for good governance\nBrainstorming\n 偮What are the challenges for good governance?"

Hence, good governance cannot be achieved since citizens are unable to attain full and effective enjoyment of all fundamental rights.\n• Corruption: rampant corruption imperils the stability of democratic institutions by making these institutions inefficient and ineffective in delivering public services. Corruption is considered a failure of institutions in particular those in charge of investigation, prosecution, and enforcement. Corruption damages the development process in many ways. First, it distorts economic systems by creating consistent budget deficit, which leads to persistent inflation reducing the real purchasing power of consumers. Secondly, it undermines social confidence and capacity in the public institutions to fulfill their obligations to the people and it reinforces existing power relationships that are themselves part of the development problem. Thirdly, highly visible corruption accentuates the sense of injustice and grievance associated with poverty, unemployment, and economic hardship. Corruption has also been a major challenge  to the successful implementation of economic reforms. The entrenchment of political corruption and clientelism as the principal means of economic advancement aggravates conflicts, by raising the premium on control of the state and rendering politics a more desperate, zero-sum struggle for control of economic  opportunity. The weakness of the rule of law makes it easier for leaders of different groups to mobilize violence at the grassroots as part of their efforts to win power for themselves. It also facilitates electoral fraud and violence. Citizens would have low levels of trust in one another and in the future. \nGroup Activity\n ☑What are the major challenges for good governance in your \nlocality?"

The simple reason for this is that there is no information how \ngovernment performs its works until and unless some disgrace comes up.\n• Lack of empowerment:  the common people do not get chance to voice their \nneeds while policies are formulated. This could be due to lack of desire on parts of the governments to know public opinion or to do timely consultation \nor due to lack of awareness among the public regarding policies that are being implemented.\n• Inefficient service delivery:  lack of good governance results in inefficiency \nin service provisions, and in some cases no service at all. For example, lack \nof good governance in education and health sectors results in not only lack \nof standards, information, incentives and accountability but also it leads to corruption due to which the resources allocated could be been used for private \ngain. Unresponsive and irresponsible health professionals sell medications \nand medical equipment allotted for public clinics.

It is also useful to the public to inform and know their rights and defend their interests. Creating awareness contributes in shaping societal attitudes regarding how corruption affects their wellbeing and their country in general.\n• Citizen participation: in order to facilitate accountability and transparency creating mechanisms in which citizens participate in government plays a key role in fighting corruption. Creating pathways that give citizen's relevant tools to engage and participate in their governments helps  to identify citizens problems and prioritize their needs, control and evaluate the government's commitments and create opportunities to  find solutions. It also leads to social trust, generating general consensus and producing a workable social contract up on which to base reform and development programs,  provides input to anti-corruption process by reporting corrupt activities  and reinforce healthy citizen-government relations. The participation of citizens in government used to increases the capacity to address government problems. For example, a participatory budgetary public hearing programs and systems enables citizens to become an integral parts of the decision making system. Citizens then decided the manner in which their government's expenditure are allocated and understand that putting an end to bribery frees up financial resources that could otherwise be allocated to essential social services. \n• Strengthening the civil service: One way to reduce the impacts of corruption is strengthening the civil services through:\n• Depoliticization and professionalization of officials and \nservants(employees)- proper attention should be given to activities \nthat help to create attractive career paths in the civil service. The \nexistence of non-political and professional civil service  institutions has a key significance for reducing administrative corruption.

Regarding to fighting corruption media can play  the following roles: \n• Raises public awareness about the causes, consequences and possible remedies of corruption and thus can foster a culture of integrity .\n• Inform and educate people about the effects of corruption.

It seems that peace has a variety of meanings \nin different contexts of usage. What peace is in religion may be different from what it is in philosophy, politics, military, or history.\nFrom our daily experience in life and social existence, peace can be described as a \nstate of mutual harmony between people or groups, especially in personal and group relations. It is an agreement between individuals and groups to end their hostilities and abstain from further fighting or antagonism. \n4.1.1.     Types of peace\nPeace is a multidimensional concept that can be discussed with various types  such as inner peace, outer peace, positive and negative peace.\nA. Internal peace:  is also called as “inner peace” or” peace of mind or soul”. \nIt is a state of calm, and peacefulness of mind that arises due to having no suffering, or mental disturbance such as worry, anxiety, greed, hatred, ill-will, delusion and other debasements. It is peace within oneself. Internal peace is essential; it is generally regarded as true peace and as a real foundation of peace in society or peace in the world. It clearly shows that internal peace influences other peace. For example, a worried and disillusioned person is always sensitive to fight with others.\nB. External peace:  is peace that occurs in society, states, and the world. It is a normal state of society, countries and the world - a state of peaceful and happy coexistence of people as well as nature. External peace can be described in different senses such as: absence of war, disorder, disturbances, hostility, social injustice, social insecurity, violations of human rights, riots, terrorism, etc. In its broader sense external peace includes a state of social \nBrainstorming\n 偮What does internal and external peace mean?\n 偮What do you mean by positive and negative  peace?"

As such, external peace is the absence of all social evils as well as the presence of social virtues.\nC. Positive peace: is a true, lasting, and sustainable peace built on justice for all peoples. It is the presence of the attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies. The concept of positive peace involves the elimination of the root causes of war, violence, and injustice and the conscious attempt to build a society that reflects these commitments.

Negative peace: is defined as a peace without justice. It is a false sense of “peace” that often comes at the cost of justice. Negative peace is the absence of direct violence or the fear of violence. In a negative peace situation, it may not see conflict out in the open, but the tension is boiling just beneath the surface because the conflict was never reconciled. Efforts to achieve negative peace emphasize: managing interpersonal and organizational conflict in order to control, contain, and reduce actual and potential violence, reducing the incidence of war by eliminating the extreme dangers of the war system and limiting war through international crisis management, preventing war through strategic deterrence and arms control. The concept of negative peace addresses immediate symptoms, the conditions of war, and the use and effects of force and weapons. Words and images that reveal the horror of war and its aftermath are often used by writers, artists, and citizen groups in their efforts to stop it.\nActivity 4.2\n ☑Discuss in pairs about the main features of  positive peace."

Impacts of absence of peace\nAbsence of peace has many consequences to human life and society at lar ge. \nSome of the impacts of absence of peace are:\nA. Security impacts: though peace is a desired goal for everyone, absence of \npeace leads to direct and structural violence and destruction, and structural violence inherent in the exclusion of the poor. In the absence of peace, people are denied the right to participate. This can be a system within the structure of the government that oppresses others using police or the judiciary in order to keep the rest of the members from rising above them. This, in the end, creates a painful relationship between the government and the members of 22\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to: ☑Analyze the impacts of  absence of peace\nBrainstorming\n 偮What do you know about the impacts of does absence of \npeace?"

This creates a chain of \nviolent conflict, because each one wants to be on the top and payback what the others did to them. This is why, in any society, there are always factions of those who gang up to have power, and the group who has the power does not want to leave it to others.\nB. Creates continuous social and political disharmony: absence of peace \nresults not only in immediate devastation, but long-term erosion of social cohesions and unity. People who live within uncertain situations develop a feeling of helplessness and enmity both at individual, group and community levels. Such kinds of attitudes and behaviors can destroy national unity, cohesion, reconciliation, solidarity and consciousness and put in place suspicion, hatred and subsequent creation of in-groups against out-groups, accusations and counter-accusations in a series of noises. The lack of participation in the government structures leads conflicts to escalate to bloody feud, to civil war, disrupting the stability and physical integrity of the community and exposing the community to internal factionalism. \nC. Failure to accommodate cultural diversity:  when there is no peace, \ncultural diversity will be at risk. Various ethnic, tribal or cultural groups get in to competition for power and resource control. The struggle for power and resource domination results in all political leaders and the governments officials tending to be more tribal than national in structure, with inter-tribal oppression becoming common practice. This in effect creates more societal tension and turmoil. Most of the present day protracted internal conflicts create antagonism between groups where each ethnic grouping turns against another.\nD. Undermine socio-economic developments: it is clear that sustainable social and economic development will not be achieved if peace is absent. During violent conflict, competing forces divert resources from health, education, investment and other social services to military expenditure. The absence of peace increases people with violence experiences, the accumulation of weapons is subsequently used for violent crimes, the long-term impact of traumatic experiences, social stress, erosion of trust and emergence of social prejudice and injustice.

Inability of people to fulfill basic needs of themselves and their family forces them to be displaced and seek migration to other areas. This in turn results in social alienation, and social fragmentation in countries suffer from absence of peace. In addition, conflicts tend to complicate economic structures of countries and people, lowering revenue by destroying parts of the tax base of the government and income of people while raising military expenditures, shifting resources away from social and economic spending.\nE. Grave human rights violations: absence of peace leads to weak government institutions that are ill-equipped to deal with uncertainties and power struggles between competing groups and to protect human rights. Women and children often suffer from the consequences of absence of peace (conflict) as they face high risk of becoming victims of sexual and gender-based violence, abuses, and displacement. More generally, people in the conflict affected countries are deprived of their rights to live in dignity and their opportunities to develop. They are more likely to be impoverished, unable to attend school, and denied access to health services and other public services.\nActivity 4.4\n ☑Discuss with your families about the impacts of absenceof peace."

Peace building strives to transform the social institutions and the discourse that reproduce the culture of violence and structural violence through rebuilding fractured social bonds and alter people’s expectations of themselves and others.\n• Peace building activities seeks to promote the integration of competing or alienated groups within main stream society, through providing equitable access to political decision-making, social networks, economic resources and information that can be implemented in all phases of conflict.\n• Successful peace building activities seek to create an environment that helps people to resolve their differences peacefully and lay foundations to prevent future violence, to create self- sustaining, and durable peace. It also reconciles opponents, prevents from restarting, creates rule of law mechanisms, increases tolerance and promotes coexistence, protects human rights, improves socio-economic development, reforms justice and security institutions, promotes a culture of justice, truth and reconciliation, and addresses underlying structural and societal issues."

The mechanisms are deep-rooted and contained in the custom, culture and traditions of the society.\nFeatures of indigenous conflict resolution \nmechanisms\nAlthough indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms differ from society to society, \nregion to region, and culture to culture, there are certain features that indigenous institutions share in common. These are:\nA. Context specific: one of the features of indigenous conflict resolution \nmechanisms is that each indigenous institution has its own distinct structure \nof resolution which dictates how various forms of conflict should be resolved. \nIndigenous conflict resolution approaches vary considerably from society to society, from region to region, from community to community. There are \nas many different indigenous approaches to conflict resolution as there are \ndifferent societies and communities with a specific history, a specific culture and specific custom. There is no one single and general principle and procedure \nof “indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms”. Rather, indigenous conflict \nresolution approaches are always context specific.\nB. Voluntary and consensual proceedings: indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms generally require voluntary participation of both conflicting parties \nand reaching agreement to abide by the outcomes. Indigenous institutions do \nnot have the kind of coercive mechanism as does the formal or modern system, and rely on social pressure and exclusion from the community to deal with non-\ncompliance.\nC. Accepted and flexible norms, rules and values: indigenous conflict resolution \nmechanisms generally deliver justice in accordance with norms, rules and values that are generally known and accepted by societies. However, the rules \nand evidences are often flexible and can be adapted to particular cases and circumstances.\nD. Negotiation and compromise: indigenous  conflict  resolution  systems  generally  involve negotiation between the conflicting parties to try and resolve \nthe case amicably. This usually involves both parties accepting some measure \nof responsibility for the dispute and agreeing to the decision. Rather than one party being viewed as the winner and the other as the loser, both parties stand to"

Dynamism and responsiveness to change:  indigenous conflict resolution \nmechanisms are not static but evolve over generations to their current status, \nand can respond to changes in views and values. Many have evolved in recent \ntimes and changed over the past periods to become more formalized in response to interactions with the formal systems and regional, national or international \npressures.\nF. Restoration and maintenance of peaceful co-existence: indigenous  conflict  \nresolution mechanisms  aim  to  restore  peace  and  harmony  between  the  conflicting party  members, neighbors, clans or local groups so that the former \naccuser can continue to live together in frequent interaction.\nG. Forgiveness and compensation:  indigenous conflict resolution institutions \noften require the loser or wrongdoer to ask forgiveness and/ or pay compensation, \nrather than imposing physical punishment or imprisonment.  Compensation is \noften paid by one individual, family or clan to another in the form of restorative penalty that enables parties to be reconciled.\nIndigenous conflict resolution mechanisms in \nEthiopia\nEthiopia is believed to be a country of more than 80 ethnic groups, who have their \ndifferent languages, cultures, values, norms, and religions. The wide diversity of societies in Ethiopia makes the state a home for numerous indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms. These diverse societies have developed their own distinctive political, administrative, economic, social, and judicial systems. These indigenous systems across the country have responded to various kinds of conflicts ranging from petty offences, civil cases, such as financial and contractual disputes to murder cases and blood feuds. The “Makabanna” in Afar, “Shimagille” in Amhara, “Bayto” in Tigray, “Jarsumma” in Oromo, “Sera” in Sidama, Halaba, Hadiya and Kembata, “Xeer” in Somali, “Korefinie” in the Gamo, “Ye Joka” in Gurage are some of the indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms in Ethiopia. \nThe above mentioned indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms practices by \ndifferent societies in Ethiopia are associated with the cultural norms and values of the peoples and gain their legitimacy from the community.

The roles of indigenous social institutions \nin ensuring sustainable peace\nAchieving  sustainable peace is one of the greatest concerns of all peoples  of the \nworld.

They often provide for a wide range of members of the society to participate in the judicial process. They tend to rely on consensus allowing accused and accuser to argue without interruption until one side is more persuasive. Indigenous social institutions promote the virtue of peace, solidarity, harmonious living, respect for one another and honesty. Because of this, the institutions create an ideal environment for conflict resolution through mutual exchange of privileges, goods, favors and obligations. Since these institutions impose sanctions on families and individuals who contravene their customs and traditions, they guarantee future.  \nB. Restoration of order and relationships:  indigenous conflict resolution \naims at the restoration of order and harmony of the community. Cooperation between conflicting parties has to be guaranteed for the future. Indigenous conflict resolution is thus geared towards the future. Consequently, the issue at stake is not punishment of perpetrators for deeds done in the past, but reinstitution of a basis for reconciliation. Reconciliation is necessary for the restoration of social harmony of the community in general and of social relationships between conflict parties in particular. The aim is not to punish, an action which would be viewed as harming the group a second time. Re-establishing harmony implies reintegrating the deviant members because the ultimate matter is restoring good relations. The ultimate aim of sustainable peace is the restoration of relationships.\nC. Addressing the psycho-social and spiritual dimensions of conflicts and sustainability of peace:  indigenous social conflict resolution institutions \nnot only deal with material issues, reason and talk, but also, they deal with the spiritual aspects, feelings and non- verbal communications. As has been pointed out already, reconciliation as the basis for the restoration of communal harmony and relationships is at the heart of customary conflict resolution. By means of reconciliation, relations between conflicting parties are restored, and both the perpetrators and the victims are re-integrated into the community. Traditional approaches are inclusive, not exclusive. Traditional"

The mental healing of those people who were deeply traumatized by the experiences of violent conflict is an aspect of peace building that is at least as important as material reconstruction. Traditional approaches are well suited to address this dimension. They take into account conflict transformation and peace building not only an issue of reason, rationality and talk, but also as of affects, emotions, imaginations and of the spirit.\nD. Providing for inclusion and participation:  as all parties (and every member \nof each party) are responsible for the conflict, everybody also has to take responsibility for its solution. A solution can only be achieved by consensus. Every side has to perceive the resolution as a win-win outcome, compatible with its own interests – which are not only confined to the material sphere, but also comprise issues of honor, prestige, and saving one’s face. To pursue inclusive and participatory approach at all levels of the conflict resolution is extremely complex and time-consuming, but provides greater chance of success than approaches that are confined to the ‘leaders’ of the conflict parties. ‘Additional’ activities that ‘supplement’ the ‘real’ negotiation also are very important in this context. According to the holistic nature of custom, it is not appropriate to isolate specific ‘political’ events (such as negotiations) from the overall context. \nE. Ensuring accessibility to the community: unlike other modern institutions, indigenous social institutions are accessible to communities. When conflicts arise, they are immediately solved by making consensus among the conflicting parties. When conflicts are protracted, they risk social harmony. Indigenous social institutions also understand the background and context of the conflicts and examining past relationships as crucial elements for ensuring sustainable peace. Indigenous social institutions view reconciliation as long-term process rather than a quick-fix military solution which is the main norm in the modern methods."

Types of federalism\nFederal systems are usually known for dividing power between the federal \ngovernment and the states. However, laws that are made by the states (regions) usually apply to the respective regions where as laws by federal legislatures apply to all states. In con-federal arrangements, the central government has no direct authority over citizens’ life. However, in federations the federal government has direct authority over citizens by legislating rules and laws. The issue is how federal governments execute their laws across the territory of their country (states).\nEnforcement and coordination of such laws throughout the territory is an essential \naspect of building one political and economic community. Based on how federal governments execute their laws across their whole territory (states) federations can be classified as: Dual federalism and Cooperative federalism22\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to: ☑Identify types of federalism\n ☑Explain the advantage and disadvantages  of each type of \nfederalism\nBrainstorming\n 偮What do you know the major types of federalism?"

Types of federalism\nA) Dual federalism\nBrainstorming\n 偮What is dual federalism?\nDual federalism is a system that clearly divides government authority between \nstate and national governments. Many refer to Dual Federalism as Layer Cake Federalism. Speaking informally, state governments will have their own powers where the central government could not intervene and the other way around as well. Earlier, state governments controlled almost all aspects of individual citizens. Whereas the national government had authority over internal improvements, international relations and regulations of those relations, determining commercial aspects between the states, etc.\nAdvantages of dual federalism\nAdvantages of having dual federalism can be accounted to the following aspects.\n1. It allows protection of local jurisdictions from federal Government overreach. It prevents the federal government from having too much power in its hands.\n2. It also allows local laws to develop and imply reflecting on the requirements"

Different states have varying laws regarding \ndivorce, marriage, speed limits, etc. These laws were formed on the basis of the respective state’s requirements. For instance, a state that is less populated and congested might assign a higher speed limit than others.\nDisadvantages of dual federalism\nWhile dual federalism offers its fair share of pros, it does warrant a few cons.\n1. It ensures that tension between state and federal government always stays at the brim. This rising tension between them isn’t favorable for the development and wellbeing of the state and the country as a whole.\n2. The rising tension also leads to decreasing levels of cooperation between the federal and state governments. This then results in reduced efficiency of programs that require full cooperation from both governing bodies.\n3. As the power at the hands of states increases, the unity between the different states tends to decrease. \nB)  Cooperative federalism \nBrainstorming\n 偮What is cooperative federalism?\nCooperative federalism requires state and national governments to share power and collaborate on overlapping functions. Cooperative federalism is the federal government giving tax revenue to the states in order to fund interstate highways; the states are allowed to govern the construction and maintenance process in accordance with goals set by the national government.\nCooperative federalism, also known as marble-cake federalism, is a concept of \nfederalism in which federal, state, and local governments interact cooperatively and collectively to solve common problems, rather than making policies separately but"

This gave the people a sense of participation in their government, and it also prevented either the state or the government from gaining an excessive amount of power.\n• States have an incentive to cooperate with the federal government.\n• States can influence how programs are implemented.\nThe disadvantages of cooprartive federalism:\n• A disadvantage of Cooperative Federalism was a decrease in the state’s powers. Instead of them being on their own, the federal government may intervene in policies once reserved to the states.\n• \nActivity 5.1\n ☑Which federal systems do you recommend for our country? \nwhy?"

Key features of federalism\nThere is admittedly difficulty in defining what we earlier noted vaguely as \nfederations. Like many concepts and institutions, federations are in a process of change and the ways they manifest themselves in different polities are far from the same. Nonetheless, many continue to speak and write about federations believing that they share certain common characteristics. The purpose of the following section is part of the exercise in search of common features among some federations By way of summary; the following can be listed as some essential features characterizing federal state structure33\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to: ☑Identify the key features of federalism\n ☑Evaluate the features of federalism \nBrainstorming\n 偮Can you mention some of the features of federalism?"

Division of power\nNo one contends the fact that federations are distinguished from other polities \nprimarily by the fact that political power (commonly related to legislative, executive, judicial and financial functions) is constitutionally divided between the federal government and the states. This is indirectly based on the dual principle implicit in every federation of the desire to be united and to be autonomous.\nA common feature among federations has been the existence of powerful motives \nto be united for certain purposes, on the one hand, and deep-rooted motives for autonomous states for other purposes, on the other. This underlying notion of federations has implications on the design of federations through distribution of powers. The federal government is often empowered with those powers that are shared in common and the states are empowered with those powers considered relevant for the expression of regional identity. \n5.3.2.     Decentralized system of government\nAs opposed to confederations, in decentralized governments the units, often called local governments, are subordinate to the center. However wide the powers they may exercise, the local governments are merely creations of the center by a statute and, as a result, they may be wiped out by the center at any time. The arrangement presupposes the existence of central authority, which may for one reason or another delegate a portion of its authority to the local governments but such delegation is subject to unilateral withdrawal, amendment or revocation by the center .\nThus, the delegation of power is at the mercy and unilateral discretion of the center and not as a matter of right of the local governments. Of course, in some cases \nBrainstorming\n 偮What do you understand by decentralized system of \ngovernment?"

But this does not change the theory that they are subject to unilateral revocation by the center. The center’s decision to end the local units merely requires the passage of legislation. In some instances, the autonomy of local governments may be incorporated in a constitution, yet such clauses granting authority could be changed by the central legislature alone. Besides, in decentralized systems, the emphasis is on self-rule rather than on shared rule. In a federation, on the other hand, the division of power is constitutionally guaranteed and the states are not creations of the federal government.\nBoth the federal government and the states derive their authority from the federal \nconstitution and as a result neither level can change the terms of the compact as enshrined in the constitution.\n5.3.3.      Written and Supreme federal constitution\nA second essential point that one observes as a shared feature in federations relates to the fact that the division of power between the federal government and the states is based on a written and supreme federal constitution to which both orders of government must submit. Federations originate from particular bargains struck at a particular time designed to serve for generations. Written constitutions are, therefore, necessary records of the terms of the bargain. Indeed, to write and adopt a constitution is to agree to the bargain itself. The terms of the agreement, which establish the federal government and the states and which distribute powers between them, must been shined in a supreme federal constitution, which is binding. This is a logical necessity deriving from the nature of the federation itself. If the federal government and the states are to remain autonomous within their respective spheres of jurisdiction, the authority of one should not depend on the other but must derive from something supreme to both of them.\nBrainstorming\n 偮What characterizes federal constitutions?"

Advantages of federalism\nFederalism is a form of government that allows for more than one central entity to \nhave power. What this means is that there is a federal government which is above all others, and smaller, more localized forms of governments that take control of local and regional issues. The idea behind this is to be able to better suit the needs of each area of the country, but some issues certainly arise.\nFigure 5.2 Advantages of federalism\n1. Division of powers\nIn a federal government the powers of administration are divided between the center and the units. The powers may be distributed in two different ways. Either the constitution states what powers the federal authority shall have, and leaves the remainder to the federating units, or it states what powers the federating units shall possess and leave the remainder to the federal authority. \n2. Separate government\nIn a federal form of government, both the center and the units have their separate set of governmental apparatus. America is a federation of states. States have therefore separate legislatures and separate executives."

As a federation is a political \npartnership of various states and consequently there must be a written agreement in the form of a written constitution.\n4. Rigid constitution\nThe constitution of a federation should be more or less rigid. It is regarded as a sacred agreement, the spirit of which should not be easily violated. A flexible constitution allows a scope to the central government to curtail the autonomy of the federating states.\n5. Special judiciary\nIn a federation, there are possibilities of constitutional disputes arising between the federal /center and the units or between one unit and another. All these disputes are to be adjudicated in the light of the constitution. For this purpose a special judiciary with wide powers must be established. It should act as the custodian and guardian of the constitution. It should be vested with powers of declaring any law, national or local, if it is at variance with the articles of the constitution. The constitution is thus the supreme law in a federation to which both the centric and the state must adhere to.\n6. Better understanding of local issues and demands \nThe central government has no true way to understand what issues, demands and changes need to be made in every area of the country. This is why federalism is such a great advantage. The smaller branches of the local governments are right in the middle of the local society. They are better suited to deal with the problems that may arise in grass root levels.\n7. Increasing citizen participation\nDue to the existence of dual level of governments federalism increases citizens level of participation in the government decision making at the grass root level.\n8. protection against tyranny\nOne of the most important points of federalism in dividing the power between the"

More efficiency\nWhen some of the powers of the government are dispersed among the states, giving states the right to solve some of their own problems; it allows more efficiency within the system. Trying to have a national solution to all problems, which could be referred to as a ‘cookie-cutter method’ of law and policy making, ends up with solutions that are more effective in some states, and less effective in others. To allow states to create solutions to their own problems using policies and laws that work best in their states means that each state can come up with its own solution, making government/ governance more efficient.\n5.4.2.

Conflict of authority \nThe biggest problem that arises when you have two bodies of government in power \nis the power struggle. Both central and state governments intend to assert their power over the other which at times causes conflict between them. Along term conflict between the central and state governments can even create hurdles in the national development and prosperity.\n2. Regionalism over patriotism \nThe mark of a great country is just how patriotic and prideful the citizens is to be part of it. Federalism, since it promotes smaller levels of government, promotes smaller levels of pride. It can put one region against another and take away from the feeling of patriotism that should be present all over the entire country .\n3. Lack of accountability \nThe responsibility of the government being shared, it becomes very easy for one sector to release responsibility for the other, and vice versa. This can become a very large problem because if something goes wrong, both sides of the government can relinquish control for the responsibility.\n4. Inequalities between states \nThe federal form of government allows for regional inequalities between different states. For example, instead of education funding throughout the country being the same, since it is a state issue, some states will spend more per caption education than other states, causing what could be considered a disparity. The same goes for other things as well such as taxes, health care programs, and welfare programs which increases regional inequality amongst the different states.\n5. Blockage of nationalist policies by states \nStates can fight against the existence of certain national laws by challenging them in court, or going out of their way to not enforce those national laws, or even deliberately obstructing enforcement of national laws."

The roles of federalism in \naccommodating diversity in Ethiopia\nThe rationale of federalism in contemporary Ethiopia is primarily the reconciliation \nof ethnic diversity with political unity. In many ways the present federal system is the culmination of a long period of searching for a constitutional formula which can unite and contain the Ethiopian peoples. Ethiopia has been a country that, for almost a century, experienced a highly centralized unitary state structure, irrespective of the diverse multiethnic groups that exist within the state. For a very longtime in its history, Ethiopia remained a centralized state55\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to: ☑Explain the role of federalism in Ethiopia\n ☑Identify the nature of Ethiopian federalism\nBrainstorming\n 偮What  do  you  think that  federalim  in  Ethiopia   \naccommodates  diversity?"

Any viable government structure must be marked by a considerable degree of decentralization. Thus, federalism could offer a promising formula for a smooth and satisfactory process of unity. The introduction of federal system was denied the attention and recognition during the past centuries as most governments used to propagate the idea,” one nation- one government, one nation one-country, one country –one nation, one language and one religion”. This has completely side lined the virtues of diversity.\nThe existing federal arrangement, the federal democratic republic of Ethiopia, \nis devised with the aim to accommodate the interest of distinct ethnic groups in Ethiopia. Federalism is one of the essential elements to accommodate rights, needs, claims and demands emerging among diverse ethnic groups. The reason Ethiopia has recognized federalism as one essential mechanism in the current constitution is to accommodate its multi-faceted diversity.\n5.5.1.     The features of Ethiopian federalism\nBrainstorming\n 偮What are the unique features of the Ethiopian federal system?\nSome of the peculiar features of the Ethiopian federal system are:\nPower  division between states and the federal government. \nFederalism as a system of government has a theoretical establishment that has two levels of government within a state and the federal government. The same applies to the Ethiopia federal structure. In such states power distribution between the two levels is a necessary condition without which the system itself losses its basic essence.

It was not only limited to enumerating the powers of the states and the federal government. Respecting and mutual non-intervention in to the powers of each other is also the case in point under the constitution. Article 50(8) declares that” Federal and state power are defined by this constitution. The states shall respect the powers of the federal government.

The article begins by stating that the House of peoples representatives can legislate in all matters that are exhaustively enumerated to the federal government under article 51of the constitution. So, all federal jurisdictions fall under the competence of the House of people’s representatives.\nThe house of peoples’ representatives together with the house of federation can \ntake appropriate measures on human right violation that cannot be controlled by any regional state.

Each nationality would be represented at least by one member, but the provision favored large ethnic groups to have more representation when it decided that for each one million additional population, one more representative will be allocated for the ethnic group. These members can be elected either directly or by the people or indirectly by the state council (FDRE constitution article 61-62)."

Some do not seem to have acquired the status of nation/nationality, which the Constitution ascribes to them. They have not been able to articulate regional interests worth constituting a federal unit. The lack of experience, skilled manpower and resources and historical marginalization’s may have aggravated the problem but the fact that there is more trouble in some of the constituent states which have not been historically mobilized, calls for some sort of asymmetric federal system, at least in the short run. In relation to such constituent states the powers of the federal government need to be extensive compared to that of the regions.\nUnit summary\n• Federalism is a system of government in which the same territory is controlled by two levels of government. Generally, an overarching national government is responsible for broader governance of larger territorial areas, while the smaller subdivisions, states, and cities govern the issues of local concern.\n• Federalism is a type of government in which the power is divided between the national government and other governmental units. It contrasts with a unitary government in which a central authority holds the power, and a confederation in which states, for example, are clearly dominant.\n• Federalist form of government has several advantages such as protecting us from tyranny, dispersing power, increasing citizen participation, and increasing effectiveness. It also has disadvantages such as increasing inequalities between states, states blocking national policies, Conflict of authority and Lack of accountability"

An \nunderstanding of human rights is an important part of our individual status as human beings and of our collective status as members of the global community of humankind.\nThe notion of human rights infers that fundamental entitlements belong to every \nmember of the human race. These are privileges someone can claim just because he/she is a human being without any discrimination based on condition.

Different scholars in the field agreed on the fact that human rights derived from fundamental human dignity and worth. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR, Article 2), stipulates that human rights belong to every human being ―without distinction of political or other opinion the only criteria someone must fulfill to enjoy these rights is being a human. \nHuman rights provide the minimum standards indispensable for people to live worth-\nliving life. Human rights allow people to live the life they deserved to live, they aspire to live, and to live a life with dignity and equality. Human rights give people a full control of their life and the freedom to choose how they live, how they express themselves, and what kind of government they want to support, among many other things. Human rights also guarantee people the means necessary to satisfy their basic needs, such as food, housing, and education, so they can take full advantage of all opportunities. \n6.1.1.

Every individual is entitled to enjoy his or her human rights \nwithout distinction of “race” or ethnic background, color, sex, sexual orientation, \ndisability, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, birth or other status. We should note that the universality of human rights does not in \nany way threaten the rich diversity of individuals or of different cultures. Universality \nis not synonymous with uniformity. Diversity requires a world where everyone is equal, and equally deserves respect. Human rights serve as minimum standards \napplying to all human beings; each state and society is free to define and apply \nhigher and more specific standards. For example, in the field of economic, social and cultural rights we find the obligation to undertake steps to achieve progressively the \nfull realization of these rights, but there is no stipulated position on raising taxes to \nfacilitate this. It is up to each country and society to adopt such policies in the light \nof their o wn circumstances.\nEternality:  the only time individuals stop enjoying their human rights is at the time \nof natural death. Otherwise these rights are in principle eternal.\nInalienability: means that you cannot lose them because they are linked to the \nvery fact of human existence. They are inherent to all human beings. In particular circumstance, some – though not all - may be suspended or restricted. For example, if someone is found guilty of a crime, his or her liberty can be taken away; or in times of national emergency, a government may declare this publicly and then derogate from some rights, for example in imposing a curfew restricting freedom of movement.\nIndivisible and interdependent:  means that different human rights are intrinsically \nconnected and cannot be viewed in isolation from each other. The enjoyment of \none right depends on the enjoyment of many other rights and no one right is more important than the rest. This means that one set of rights cannot be enjoyed fully without the other. For example, making progress in civil and political rights makes it easier to exercise economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, violating economic, social and cultural rights can negatively affect many other rights."

In some countries where democracy is well consolidated this inviolability logic extends to even the times of crisis/emer gency\n .\nHuman rights are irrevocable: they cannot be taken away by any power or authority because these rights originate with the social nature of man in the society of human beings and they belong to a person simply because he is a human being. As such human rights have similarities to moral rights. \n6.1.2.     Classification of human rights\nFigure 6.2.  Generation of human right\na. First generation rights \nThe first tier or “generation” consists of civil and political rights and derive primarily \nfrom the\n17th and 18th century political theories which are associated with the English, \nAmerican, and French revolutions.

The rights set forth in Articles 2-21 of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights include: freedom from discrimination; freedom from slavery; \nfreedom from torture and from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; freedom \nfrom arbitrary arrest and detention; the right to a fair and public trial; freedom of thought, conscience, and religion; freedom of opinion and expression; and the right \nto participate in government through free elections.\nb. Second generation rights\nThe second generation of rights broadens the primarily political focus of earlier views \nto include economic, social, and cultural rights. This view originated primarily in the \nsocialist traditions of Marx and Lenin. According to this view, rights are conceived \nmore in positive rather than negative terms, and thus encourage the intervention of the state. Illustrative of these rights are Articles 22-27 of the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights. They include the right to social security; the right to work; the \nright to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of self and family; and the right to education. \nc. Third generation rights\nThese views are the product of the rise and decline of the nation-state in the last half of the twentieth century. These rights have been championed by the Third World and \nremain somewhat controversial and debated. The specific rights include the right to \npolitical, economic, social, and cultural self- determination; the right to economic and social development; and the right to participate in and benefit from “the common \nheritage of mankind.”\n6.1.3.

This fundamental principle is stipulated in Article 10 of the constitution, which articulates, “Human rights and freedoms, emanating from the nature of mankind, are inviolable and inalienable”. Thus, one can readily observe that the long list of rights embodied in chapter three of the constitution is the reaffirmation of these principles. One third of the provision is devoted to human rights and democratic rights.\nThe FDRE constitution in its chapter three clearly stated list of rights that are divided \ninto two categories, namely that of ‘Human Rights’ and ‘Democratic Rights’.

            "text": "134 Citizenship Education Student Textbook                     Grade 10\n Obligation to protect\nThe “obligation to protect ” requires States to protect individuals against abuses by \nnon-State actors, foreign State agents, or State agents acting outside of their official \ncapacity. The obligation entails both a preventative and remedial dimension. A State is thus obliged to enact legislation protecting human rights; to take action to protect individuals when it is aware (or could have been aware) of threats to their human rights; and also to ensure access to impartial legal remedies when human rights violations are alleged. Once again, the right to education can serve as an example. The right of children to education must be protected by the State from interference and indoctrination by third parties, including parents and the family, teachers and the school, religions, sects, clans and business firms. States enjoy a margin of discretion with respect to the obligation to protect.\n Obligation to fulfill\nAccording to the “obligation to fulfill”, States are required to take positive action to ensure that human rights can be realized. The extent of the obligation to fulfill varies according to the right concerned and the State’s available resources. Generally speaking, however, States should create “the legal, institutional and procedural conditions that rights holders need in order to realize and enjoy their rights in full.” In respect of the right to education, for instance, States must provide ways and means for free and compulsory primary education for all, free secondary education, higher education, vocational training, adult education, and the elimination of illiteracy (including such steps as setting up enough public schools or hiring and remunerating adequate number of teachers).\n6.2.3.     Instruments for the protection of human \nrights\nThe universal declaration of human rights (1948)\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by resolution of the UN \nGeneral Assembly on December 10, 1948.  Although it is not a legally binding instrument, the Declaration was adopted for the purpose of defining the \"human rights\" and \"fundamental freedoms\" referenced in Article 55(c) of the UN Charter, which all UN member states are obligated to observe and respect.  The Declaration"

Many UN member states have incorporated \nthe principles set forth in the Declaration in their national constitutions.  These principles also provide a foundation for many of the core human rights treaties subsequently drafted under the auspices of the UN and for regional treaties and national laws enacted to safeguard human rights. \nInternational human rights conventions \nBesides to the UN Charter and the UDHR, the UN presently has more than ten core human rights treaty based human rights instruments. These includes, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1948), the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Slavery Convention (1926, but amended by Protocol in 1953), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families.\nRegional mechanisms \nIn addition to the international human rights regime functioned under the UN umbrella, there are regional human rights systems which cover three parts of the world; Africa, the Americas and Europe. These two (international and regional) systems are aimed to make sure state actors are fulfilling their obligation in promoting, protecting, providing and fulfilling. \nThe Ethiopian human rights instruments \nThe foundation of the observance of the human rights in Ethiopia is the FDRE Constitution, which was ratified in 1994. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land and the source and basis of legality of all other laws. The FDRE Constitution classifies human rights as one of its five fundamental principles and declares that human rights and freedoms, emanating from the nature of mankind, are inviolable and inalienable and that the human rights of citizens and peoples are respected."

Further Article 9/4/ and Article 13 of the Constitution state that international agreements ratified by Ethiopia are an integral part of the law of the land and the fundamental rights and freedoms specified in the Constitution are to be interpreted in a manner conforming to the principles of the UDHR, International Covenants on Human Rights and international instruments adopted by Ethiopia.\nThe Constitution has required the establishment of human rights and democratic \ninstitutions; including the national human rights commission, general attorney office and office of ombudsmen, with an independent judiciary or courts equipped with the needed resources. \nUnit summary\n• Human rights describe basic ways that all people in the world should be treated and recognize that every human being has equal value. The rights are listed in different legal documents such as national constitutions and/or international conventions. They include every aspect of people’s lives such as the right to work, to have a family, to go to school and to receive a pension.\n• The Universal Declaration of Human Rights associates human rights with \"the highest aspiration\" of the common people, and proclaims itself to be a \"common standard\" for all. Human rights are also recognized and stipulated in our FDRE Constitution in similar manner. Thus, the realization of all human rights is not a matter of choice for states and non-state actors working in the area, it is rather an obligation must be fulfil if citizens have to live a worth living life."

The meaning of patriotism\nPatriotism has originated from the Latin term ‘patria’ which means father land. \nTherefore, patriotism is a sentiment; a psychological attachment to one’s nation. It refers to belongingness to a definite historical and cultural setting and a specific country having definite language and customs. \nPatriotism is:\n• Deep-rooted sentiment of having a separate father or mother land. \n• Live for or devotion to one’s country and to the fundamental values and \nprinciples upon which its security and welfare depends \n• The feeling of prou d of his or her country’s history, culture and tradition \nPatriotism is often conceptualized as a feeling one shows to his or her country.

It is thought that a true patriot \nis someone who feels proud of his or her country‘s history, culture and its standing \nin world affairs.\nFurthermore, the definition of patriotism depends on the nature of the existing \npolitical system. In a democratic system, patriotism means devoting time, ability, \nknowledge and even life for the fundamental principles on which the nation’s security and welfare depend. Patriotism is expressed in the war front, in research, in good \nethics, competence in work, in Leadership and in the ability to carry responsibility. \nSuch practices should be continuous, sustainable and strongly fixed in the minds of everyone in the country.\nPatriotism or national pride is the feeling of love, devotion, and sense of attachment \nto a homeland or the country and alliance with other citizens who share the same sentiment to create a feeling of oneness among the people. This attachment can be \na combination of many different feelings, language relating to one’s own homeland, \nincluding ethnic, cultural, political or historical aspects. \nGroup Work\nDivide the class into four sized groups to discuss the following \nquestions and present the findings to the class. \n1.

Our environment is the sources of life and its very foundation so it is the responsibility of every human being to protect the environment.\nEnvironmental patriotism refers to feelings of love for his country’s environment. \nPatriotism is not only just to defend the country, but it can also be shown in the actions made to improve the quality of life and the environment. \nActivity 7.1\n ☑Explain types of patriotism."

Equality  \nConstitutional patriotism is based up on the principle of equality which refers to \nthe respect and acceptance of constitutional democracy and respect and observance \nof human rights. Every citizen is expected to protect the rights of other people as \nstipulated in the constitution. They are also entitled not to engage in any practices that violate the constitution.\nPeople have different laws and systems by which they are administered. These laws \nand systems include citizens’ rights and responsibilities in return for basic human and democratic rights, duties and responsibilities which are expected of citizens \nin democratic system. Citizens do not have equal rights and responsibilities in \nundemocratic systems.33\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to: ☑Identify the bases of patriotism\n ☑Explain the reason why citizens are scarifying their lives to \nprotect their country.\nBrainstorming\n 偮Why do citizens need to patriotic?"

In the previous regimes, patriotic feelings and opinions did not \ninclude the view of citizens of their country Rather it gave attention to the geography, \nnatural environment, minerals, mountains, rivers and soil Praising the country’s spiritual and material values does not indicate patriotism.\n7.3.2.      Tolerance \nTolerance is an important attribute of true patriotism. In countries such as Ethiopia where different ethnic groups with varied languages, and religious and other attributes \ncoexist, it is important that there is a space for all of them to have some common \nground that offers them the opportunity and privilege to claim pride in their own legacy and history. In the past history of Ethiopia, only few groups or individuals \ntake pride since the country does not recognize their differences in identity and \nculture.\nCurrently, in a democratic and constitutional system which recognizes differences \nand multiculturalism, tolerance is not a gift that we provide to others. It is a very \nimportant constitutional and civil obligation that citizens should respect and accept the differences in values as normal and natural for peaceful co-existence.\n7.3.3.     Loyalty \nConstitutional patriotism is based upon constitutional loyalty. That is, in a democratic system citizens are expected to be loyal to their constitution, to the people, to their \nelected government and to their community at large. Also, citizens are expected \nto take care of others property and wealth. In a democratic system, citizens shall perform duties and responsibilities they are assigned to do.  \n7.3.4.     Concern for the well-being of one’s \ncountry \nPatriotic citizens are ready to defend their country. Ethiopia has a long tradition \nof cases where its people paid enormous sacrifices to save its independence and \nterritory. This type of love for a country is unquestionably patriotic. Because of the \nsacrifices citizens made, Ethiopia is proud of its resistance against colonialism and foreign invasions.\nEvery citizen has the moral obligation to pay tributes and show respect to those \nheroes. They were patriots who came in agreement from many nation, nationalities and peoples to fight against their common enemy."

Any law, customary practices or \ndecisions of an organ of state or a public official which contravene this constitution shall be of no effect. In a democratic and constitutional framework, it is the duty of every citizen to show unreserved support for the protection and implementation of the constitution. Individual citizens can also show their loyalty to the constitution by making their own contribution for the respect of the rights and entitlements of individuals and groups. \n7.3.7.      Carrying out personal and civic duties and \nresponsibilities\nTrue patriots are very good at carrying out personal    and civic duties and \nresponsibilities. They are not excessively self-centered. They understand that their success is dependent on their healthy relationships with others and their commitment to carry out their tasks without any enforcement. True patriots are so much self-reliant. \n7.3.8.

Especially in our families and in our schools, \nchildren who grow up with patriotic sentiments tend to have a better sense of self. There are some examples of patriotism parents should teach their kids. Patriotism can take many forms and it can mean different things to different people. For some it is freedom of speech, whereas for others it might be about being able to express themselves freely. In either case, we are not alone in feeling these sentiments. This is why it’s important to be able to show your love for your country.

It also helps to develop a sense of unity and togetherness in them which give direction and purpose to their lives. For example, watching the Ethiopian flag waving high up at different events makes Ethiopians feel the sense of belonging and helps them feel good about their country.\nBuilding a stronger nation\nWhen we believe in patriotism and practice patriotic values, it automatically motivates each individual to work towards the betterment of the country. This helps the entire nation work together and reminds citizens to keep the values of their country in mind to stay united and together.\nDeveloping Patriotism sentiments reminds Ethiopians to be hardworking and honest, \nand work to make sure the country excels. It also reminds them to support each other in their endeavors.\nDeveloping patriotic spirit as admirable quality\nCitizens who know themselves well and are able to identify their beliefs and values are infinitely more attractive.

Hence, patriotic citizens voice their opinions on wrong \ndoings that happen in the country, and about the things that are unjust, only to free the country from any sort of injustice.\nc.      Eagerness to make the country better\nPatriotic citizens make constant efforts make a better country. That could be done in terms of career decision, social work, spreading awareness or even helping in saving resources. Conscious citizens are not those who expect other people to take the first step, rather they are the ones who take the initiative to take the tasks ahead.\nd. Not taking undue advantage of privileges \nPatriotic citizens consider taking undue advantage of their position in the society \nwrong. This could be in terms of very important culture, or general rights. They want \nthings that they get naturally and do not go out of the way to get special benefits. The \nunderstanding that the rest of the population suffer because of this behavior come naturally to patriotic citizens and thus, they clearly define their principles. Patriotic \ncitizens are not persons who are extraordinary; they are normal citizens who choose \nto behave in the best manner. Although it may be difficult to be ethical in today’s \nworld, it is not impossible. Conscious citizens do whatever is in their capacity to \nmake ethical things.

Basically, it is distorted by historians who wants to entertain a given political \nambitions or by historians who wrongly make use of wrong sources or sources that are not up to date.\nHistory is the narration about the past based on the fact. Every historian should use \nfacts to write history. Even though most historical accounts are based on evidence some of the can be misleading and far from the truth. This is because some writers use a certain fact and even creates evidence to construct history that is not true for whatever reason.\nIt is important to understand history what happened in the past can help us to \nunderstand and solve current problems. True history teaches us value whereas fabricated creates false impression that are used to mislead us. This means that the history you learn plays an important role in shaping your value and beliefs. This is why we say that understanding the true history is important to develop a sense of patriotic feeling towards our county. You have to each for the true history of Ethiopia to have clear understanding of the past and develop the sense of patriotism. It is only when citizens are aware of the correct history of their country that they could develop tolerance and mutual understanding to live in harmony as a member of the community.\nThus, patriots should have full knowledge of their true history and appreciate the \nrole played not only by political leaders but also by nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia in war, peace and development.\nb. Promoting common good\nThis is a concept that denotes the subordination of personal interest to the good of the community called also as civic virtue. Society is the individuals whose interests are interdependent. The furtherance of community interest promotes the common goal in which individuals remain beneficiaries. It is only though joint effort against common problem that citizens promote the value and principles of democracy and by so doing perpetuate the well-being of their community and the nation at lar ge.\nOne way which the common good could be promoted is by identifying state secret of utmost importance called importance of the county and defending them. State secrets are information whose exposure endangers the very existence of the nation. At time state secret could came to the knowledge of an individual or group owning"

Whatever the nature of the secret and no matter in what ways one become cognizant of then, so long as the secret endanger the community and threaten the interests and wellbeing of the nation they must kept secret i.e. should not be communicated to a third party.\nThe endeavor of all citizens to keep state secret for the common good, on the \nother hand, and working together on all kinds of common problems, on the other, creates common ground for mutual understanding among citizens. But promoting the common good by working with other presupposes respecting the right and the interests of partners and behaving in a civil manner. By behaving so citizens can be examples of virtue for the welfare of the community.\nWhat are some factors affecting the common good?\nThere are instances where the common good could be affected by different circumstances. Above all the common good could be affected when an attempt is made rather to subordinate the community interests to personal interests. Selfish personal interests are manifested when individuals or groups endeavor to realize their ambition at the expense of the community. Selfish personal interests retard community spirit and joint effort for common purposes.\nAnother factor that works against the common good is corruption. Corruption is \nunlawful behavior characterized by such acts like nepotism and embezzlement which damage most personal interests and rights while favoring others. As an illegal act, it obliterated good governance and the prevalence of rule of law. Corruption makes citizens lose confidence in their government and be indifferent in what is going on \nGroup Discussion\nYou heard your father, who is a government official, saying that \nthe government is to undertake a huge resettlement program in \nthe coming year.

As a result their esteem of civic virtue is affected and eventually \ndisappears, while the existence of the nation falls at stake.\nc.     Poverty reduction \nPoverty reduction is about reducing poverty to a level where citizens meet at least their basic necessities to life. Despite all the current technological advances, poverty has remained an extremely serious problem of the world. In fact, its level of magnitude varies from place to place. But at least for poorer countries poverty is the inability to meet the basic needs. Besides, prevalence of illiteracy, inadequate social services, lack of infrastructural development etc… are indicators of poverty .\nPoverty kills personal esteem and self-confidence. More than this, poverty is a stumbling block for democracy. Because poverty is followed by inequalities, transgression and rebellion that work against democratic ideas are rampant. As a result, poverty weakens social cohesion and affects the welfare of the community. A country could be disintegrated and its very existence could be endangered as long as citizens are poor and unable to meet their basic needs. Ethiopia is the one poorest country in the world in all important respect.\nd.     Voluntarism \nV oluntarism is a personal initiative taken to give service to the community not for price or personal enrichment. People volunteer to give services because they are interested in the cause because they enjoy helping others. V olunteering can provide valuable job experience to the individuals. In order to give volunteer services, citizens join together to form civic association through whom they address.\nV oluntary activities or organization at community national or international levels \nshare a common goal they aim to promote the wellbeing of people.

Dimensions of globalization\nThe process of globalization is a combination of economic, social, cultural and \npolitical dimensions or elements. \n1. Political dimensions of globalization:  refers to the intensification and \nexpansion of political interrelations across the globe for different purposes. It is characterized by the diffusion of political policies, ideologies, political culture and institution across countries of the world. \n2. Economic dimensions of globalization:  refers to the increasing interdependence \nof world economies as a result of the growing scale of cross-border trade of commodities and services, flow of international capital and rapid spread of technologies. It reflects the continuing expansion and mutual integration of market. It is also seen strictly in terms of a process of economic integration, increased flow of money, goods and services across borders.\n3. Social dimensions of globalization:  referes the sharing of ideas and information \nbetween and through different countries using internet, social media, etc. It also refers to the impact of globalization on the life and work of people, their families, and their societies. Concerns and issues are often raised in relation to the impact of globalization on employment, working conditions, income and social protection. This encompasses security, culture and identity, inclusion or exclusion and the cohesiveness of families and communities.\n4. Cultural dimensions of globalization: refers to the circulation and sharing \nof ideas, meanings and values across countries and cultures with the effect of increasing social contacts. Globalization is not only the flow of money and commodities, i.e., the process of integrating the economy, but also the process of becoming connected and integrated among the people everywhere through culture.\nActivity 8.1\n ☑Discuss the different elements or dimensions of globalization."

If countries manage it effectively to seize the opportunities, globalization will have positive effects/advantages. If not, it will have negative effects.  \n8.2.1.     Advantage of globalization\nGlobalization has various advantages which positively affect the world community in several different ways. Some of the advantages/ benefits of globalization are:\na. Economic advantages\nGlobalization has led to a sharp increase in trade and economic exchange.  The acceleration of economic exchange has led to strong global economic growth. It has also fostered rapid industrial development which contributed to the development of many technologies and commodities available to us nowadays. Globalization realizes a global common market based on the freedom of exchange of goods and capital.  Increased trade to larger and more diverse markets results in greater revenues and increased domestic growth.\nAdvances in transportation, information and communications have resulted in \nunprecedented leaps in productivity, economic expansion and increased international trade. Globalization can also promote the emergence and appraisal of environmental comparative advantages, including the sustainable use of natural capital having economic value (forests, fisheries, tourist attractions), ecological value (natural sinks for the absorption of carbon and other pollutants) or aesthetic, historical or scientific value.\nb. Political advantages\nOne major political advantage of globalization is that it makes information available on how other countries are governed and the freedoms and rights their people enjoy. Globalization creates universal awareness by defining basic and generally accepted principles of democratic governance such as good governance, transparency and accountability as guiding principles.  The participation of countries in various international treaties plays a role for the protection of human rights at the international and regional level and increases the number of standards applied globally; e.g."

The political integration \nat the regional and international level promoted through globalization is likely to lead to a deeper cooperation in security issues.\nAnother important advantage of globalization is its influence on political culture \nat national and international level by creating a kind of common political culture among people in the world. Globalization also causes common human values like peace, justice, equality, freedom, democracy, competition and free election even if many countries have failed to promote them as principles.\nc.      Social advantage\nGlobalization has the following social advantages:   \n• Globalization  has  brought  quantitative  and  qualitative  transformations,  both  in  social development in the society by creating opportunities for wider spread of materials and spiritual values.\n• Globalization turned education to be market oriented, and this could enable labor to move from country to country to get jobs and to market their products. With the demand of fulfilling what the market needs, globalization forces states of the world have to adopt proper educational policies.\n• The continuous dispersion of ideas, knowledge and beliefs, access to information from many new sources through the growing technology (mass-media, and internet), has increased travelling and migration of people, and improvements in areas like healthcare, education and ecological practices.\n• The growth of technologies changes societies’ living conditions, makes peoples life simple and easy. For example, internet, cell phones and computers enable people to communicate and quickly disseminate information.\nd.

The growth of cross-cultural \ncontacts; advent of new categories of consciousness and identities such as Globalism - which embodies cultural diffusion, the desire to consume and enjoy foreign products and ideas, adopt new technology and practices, and participate in a “world culture’, for example, the trading of coffee, which is said to be originally from Ethiopia, and  consumed in many parts of the world. Due to commercial exchange, coffee has become a globally consumed commodity.\ne. Financial advantage\nGlobalization simplifies financial regulations, eliminates mediators and breaks down the barriers between the world’s financial centers. The goal is to make easier the exchange of capital between the world’s financial players, for example, receiving money from relatives living abroad easily through money gram and other agents is one of the benefits of globalization. Globalization helps the emergence of worldwide financial market and gives better access to external financing of corporate, national and sub national borrowers. \n8.2.2.     Disadvantages of globalization\nGlobalization causes numerous negative impacts on the world states and people, particularly on the developing states:\na. Cultural loss/ insecurity\nApart from all the benefits globalization has had, cultural exchanges have homogenized cultures of the world. That is why some cultures, languages and traditional practices are disappearing from some countries. Globalization gradually  leads to the obliteration and replacement of local and regional cultural practices, \nBrainstorming\n 偮What  are  the  negative  impacts  of  globalization?"

The \nimported cultures easily replace local cultures, causing reduction in diversity through hybridization or even assimilation. Westernized or Americanized cultures are wide spreading in the form of music and films in many countries of the world. Arguably the hegemonic effects of globalism and homogenization of culture as the capitalist globalist economy becomes the “only” way that countries may participate through the international forums leads to a destruction rather than an appreciation of differences in culture. Nowadays, some segments of the world population feel that their unique histories and values that govern their communities are under threat. For example, in many African countries the young generations prefer to eat western fast-foods, western cloths, rather than their own foods and traditional clothes, etc. Even when they talk, they mix English with local languages. They give a foreign name for their children.  This clearly shows that they give up aspects of their identities for westernization of cultures\nb. Political disadvantages\nIn the political sphere, globalization affects nations negatively in the following ways:\n• Globalization  has often pressured developing countries’ leaders to adopt models, strategies, policies and measures that are diametrically opposite to the feelings and sentiments of the vast majority of their people. This has led to the rise or reinforcement of authoritarian regimes. A good recent example of this is the pressure on many African governments to take certain measures in the fight against terrorism at the behest of external powers.\n• Fragmentation of national economies, polities, societies and cultures that are triggered by globalization weaken national consciousness and cohesion, leading to social divisiveness and instability, which in turn facilitate the emergence of authoritarian rule.\n• Globalization has given new characteristics to conflicts. Feeding these conflicts is the global traffic in weapons, involving new actors and blurring political and business interests."

Economic effects/ insecurity\n• Despite its benefits, the economic growth driven by globalization is not done \nwithout negative effects. Globalization undermines the economic fabrics of many societies making them vulnerable to violation of markets and destroying the environment systematically. Economic globalization creates income inequalities, disproportionate wealth and trade that benefits world countries differently. That means some countries, companies and individuals benefit more from the phenomenon of globalization, while others lose from globalization. Globalization reinforces economic marginalization of developing economies and their dependence on a few primary goods for which demand and prices are externally determined. This in turn accentuates poverty and economic inequality as well as the ability of the majority in developing countries to participate meaningfully in the social and political life of their countries. Economic stagnation also triggers a substantial brain-drain from poor countries, further weakening the ability of these countries to manage their economies efficiently and effectively. While the scientific and technological forces unleashed by globalization facilitate, to some extent, access to advanced technology and information, this is reducing the development of indigenous technologies and distorting patterns of production in developing countries notably by utilizing capital intensive methods of production instead of labor-intensive ones, which in turn increase unemployment and poverty. \nd. Social insecurity\nThe negative impacts of globalization on social security can be manifested in the form of insecurity impersonal life, health, job and employment: \n• Personal insecurity: criminals obtain benefits from globalization. \nDeregulated capital markets, advances in information and communication technology and cheaper transport makes illicit trade in drugs, women, weapons and laundered make flows easier, faster and less restricted. which contributes to violence and crimes that threaten neighborhoods around the world.

The pressures of global competition have led countries and employers to adopt more flexible labor policies with more precarious work arrangements. \n• Health insecurity: growing travel and migration helps the spread of diseases, for instance HIV/AIDS and recently Covid-19. Such diseases first emerged in America and China, respectively, but the epidemic spread rapidly to new locations and affected people all over the world. AIDS has become a poor person’s disease, taking a heavy toll on life expectancy, reversing the gains of recent decades. \n• Environmental insecurity: globalization has negative effects on \nenvironment. The massive development in transportation system creates serious environmental problems such as green-house emission, global warming, and air pollution. Global economic growth and industrial productivity have big environmental consequences as they contribute to the depletion of natural resources, deforestation and the destruction of ecosystem and loss of biodiversity. The worldwide distribution of goods is also creating big garbage problems, especially plastic pollution. By promoting large scale industrial productions and globalized circulation of goods, globalization undermines resources, energy savings, and the limitations set for greenhouse gasses. As a result, globalization accelerates climate change and undermines respect for the principles of ecosystem. \nActivity 8.2\n ☑Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of globalization in \nEthiopia in the political, economic, social and cultural aspects."

Promoting indigenous knowledge \nThrough the forces of globalization, and the influences of institutions, such as, \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB), Western knowledge is produced and diffused to other parts of the world and counted as legitimate sources of all knowledge. Many developing countries are viewing western education as an instrument for their growth and they direct copy their education system from the western produced knowledge without considering the way of life’s, socio-economic structure, political culture etc. of its people. This creates problems in developing countries because of the existing gabs of knowledge between the peoples the west and others.\nAs a possible mechanisms or solutions of tackling the negative impacts of globalization \nis that greater attention should be devoted to disseminate indigenous knowledge to citizens through incorporating in education system.  Currently, redesigning an education system to carter for social, economic, political and cultural issues has been given emphasis by developing countries. Because indigenous knowledge has the potential for use in the form of practice and beliefs associated with various aspects of everyday living, local technologies, culture and expressions.  Since indigenous knowledge arises directly out of real life experiences its application can motivate people them to see their knowledge is appreciated. It can also open up opportunities to build on the knowledge of their forebears. By indigenous knowledge   here mean indigenous expression of creativity that has been passed down across generations in the areas of agriculture, healthcare (medicine), technology, food preparation, agriculture, conservation and management natural resource, and so on. Incorporating indigenous knowledge in to the education systems has contributed for the young in the developing countries to value their own creative efforts, to value traditional practices and beliefs rather than depending on technologies, cultures and beliefs derived from external countries and institutions."

Value for the importance of community development\nRecognizing community as one of the pillars successful development strategies is \nthe most important instrument for developing countries to reduce the influence of western initiative development programs/strategies, which lacks responsibility and ownership for its planning and execution. In communities, people working together, often with help from government and non-governmental organizations. In many developing countries, much important collective action is at the local level, for example, irrigation for agriculture is provided by a network of channels. These are maintained by the community which ensures that the water is shared fairly among the villages and villagers These schemes have been so successful because they entail groups of people who take responsibility for one another, helping one another out and ensuring that each pay what is due.   The people in the village know better than anyone else what will make a difference to their lives; they know how the money is spent, and any corruption hurts them directly. Having invested in the planning and execution of a project, they are more likely to feel ownership, a commitment to see it through to success, and therefore more likely to see it receive the funds required to maintain it. People in the community know best where a new well should be put, and projects with local participation have done so much better than programs designed outside the community.\nActivity 8.3\n ☑Explain the roles of indigenous knowledge in fighting against \nthe negative impacts of globalization."

Promoting indigenous social welfare/protection \nPrograms\nSocial safety net schemes, community organizations, and all other forms of government \nand community supported welfare protections are important instruments to reduce the dependence of external aids, in which developing countries are required to fulfill excessive conditionality. To manage the forces of globalization and to minimize its risks, developing countries should more and more focused on the leveling the social welfare/social protection policies for its subjects. It may be operating through various instruments such as: support for agriculture, education, health, and social food security. Social protection/social welfare programs or measures have provided the following roles:\n• Protective measures: are basic transfers to stop vulnerable groups from starving. This may include programs focusing on public employment schemes, school feeding, regular cash transfers, etc.\n• Preventive measures: stop people from falling into destitution and help them maintain their dignity and withstand modest shocks. Such measures, for example, are related with contributory social security, promoting savings and insurance, universal child allowances, etc.\n• Promote  measures:  boost  real  incomes  and  capabilities  with  livelihood-promoting interventions.\nIndigenous actors of social protection/social welfare have a significant role to play in advocating and promoting social protection for the vulnerable people by reducing vulnerability to external intervention from the rapidly globalizing world. This is for the reason that, indigenous and traditional support mechanisms in our country Ethiopia are the first line of defense against personal as well as community risks. For instance, traditional and religious, and community-based support mechanisms have been institutionalized for a long time. However, such actors have received little concern in spite of their potential socio-economic roles. Hence, there is a need to look for and capitalize on the positive sides of indigenous mechanisms of social protection."

Regional cooperation\nAway in which global issues can be approached by groups of nations a more \ncomparable economic status and with more compatible social and cultural behavior patterns. Regional cooperation is an important way of fighting the negative impacts of globalization. Regionalism intensify political and/ or economic processes of cooperation among states and other actors in particular geographic regions, which can be developed either from the decisions by companies to invest and by people to move within a region or from political, state-based efforts to create cohesive regional units and common policies for them. It is important to sustained cooperation (either formal or informal) among governments, non-governmental organizations, or the private sectors in three or more countries for mutual gains. Regional cooperation could enable different types of actors (states, regional institutions, societal organizations and other non-state actors) come to share certain fundamental values and norms. These actors also participate in a growing network of economic, cultural, scientific, diplomatic, political, and military interactions\nThe rationale of regional cooperation among less developed countries was fostering \nof transformation and the stimulation of productive capacities (industrialization), whereby investment and trading opportunities were being created. Regional organization was then built up to cope with one common problem and spill over to other problems. Regional cooperation is viewed as a functional response by states to the problems that derived from western domination. It is seen as the most effective means of solving common problems. In the first place, by creating trade blocs and cooperation frameworks, regionalism opposes the neoliberal ‘harmony of interest’ view of the world economy in favor of national (and regional) loyalties and frameworks. Conversely, the drive toward the formation of regions might be also motivated by the denial of a single universal culture (and ideology) and the promotion of alternative or pluralistic forms of social and political organizations other than the nation-states at the regional level."

It is also defined as any major trend, shock, or development that has a potential to impact globe seriously. A global issue is any issue that adversely affects the global community and environment like environmental issues, political crisis, etc. Global issues range in severity from minor issues that affect everyone to global catastrophic risks that threaten the existence of the entire human race. The problem can be as extremely global as nuclear proliferation, for example, how to prevent nuclear weapons’ spread from large and powerful countries to every nation in the world, or it can be localized problem like the disagreement between two countries on how to demarcate their common boundary.44\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to: ☑Specify  identifying criteria of global issue\n ☑Explain the major global issues\nBrainstorming\n 偮What does global issue mean?"

Diverse peoples of the world face diverse problems that affect them in a number of ways. Some of the problems and challenges are specific to each country and may require local or national efforts. On the contrary, most of the problems are universal in the sense that they are widely shared by countries and peoples of the world.\nThe followings are the top current global issues that pose actual and potential threats \nto humanity.\nA. Climate change \nCurrently climate change and environmental degradation are among the greatest \nchallenges facing humanity. While economic growth and technological innovations \nhave led to a massive increase in global wealth, it has resulted in serious degradation \nof natural resources that accelerated climate change and is leading to emerging supply constraints. Greenhouse emissions and overexploitation of natural resources, \nsoil erosion, and over fishing caused climate changes that reduced food production \nwhich is likely to put upward pressures on food prices. The world is experiencing a range of problems such as acid rain, forest destruction, decreasing biodiversity, \ndesertification, contamination of oceans and destruction of the ozone layers, but the \nbiggest problem of climate change is global warming. Global warming causes sea levels rise, increases frequency of droughts, resulting in the submersion of towns and \nvillages in islands and coastal areas, a decline in agriculture and fishing, frequent \noccurrence of unusual weather (severe storms, floods, drought, and heat waves), the spread of infectious diseases, desertification and decreasing biodiversity and other \ndestructing events.\nGenerally speaking, human activities are remarkably considered responsible for \nclimate change. Among them are the followings:\n• Massive industrialization: the expansion of global i ndustrial production \nand consumption leads to extensive demand for energy, minerals and other \nnatural resources which in turn result in the generation of harmful gases and \nparticles as by-products that negatively affect the ecosystem.\n• Rapid population growth: an increase in population means an increase \nin competition for the earth’s limited resources and hence over grazing of \nposture lands, over cultivation of farm lands, increasing deforestation to"

Although \nsubstantial progress has been made in reducing poverty, yet poverty remains deep and widespread. The poorest countries in the world are often hungry, have much less access to education, regularly have no light at night, and suffer from much poorer health. The growth of world population has increased the number of extremely poor people in the world, even though the share of people in extreme poverty is going down. Accompanying widespread poverty is widespread inequality, again as measured both by income and by other yardsticks. The income gap between poor and rich countries and the economic divide within countries has widened. In an increasing interdependent world, the high prevalence of persistence of poverty and inequality has implications for all countries. Deep deprivation weakens the capacity of states to combat terrorism, organized crime, armed conflict, and spread of disease. These in turn can have severe economic, environmental, and security consequences for neighboring states and the global community. Poverty and inequality and the associated outcomes can no longer be contained within national boundaries. This makes them global problems of huge proportions. This means that alleviating poverty and reducing inequality is critical to maintaining and strengthening regional and global stability.\nPoverty is closely related to other development issues such as the environment and \nconflict. This relationship creates a vicious cycle in which poverty brings about destruction on the environment and the worsening environmental conditions exacerbate poverty. Poverty is also stated to have become a breeding ground for terrorists and the relationship between poverty and terrorism has received more attention since the terrorist attacks threaten world security. Extreme inequality perpetuates poverty and the concentration of economic and political power reduces economic efficiency. Poverty strengthens inequality-perpetuating institutions in three ways:\n• Inequality discourages political participation of poor people, which, in turn, diminishes their access to education, healthcare, and other services that contribute to economic growth and development.\n• Inequality often prevents the building and proper functioning of impartial institutions and observance of the rule of law."

More population means more cultivation of land, by clearing forests, more education and health facilities, more consumption of fuels, more deforestations, and more agricultural production that require utilization of fertilizers, and pesticides. Application of fertilizers and pesticides result in acidic rain and contribute to pollution of air, land and water.  Over production depresses resources and biodiversity. The production of wastes, the destruction of natural habitats, pollution of water and air are becoming serious problems which affect the peoples of the world.\nPopulation explosion not only causes political, economic, social and environmental \ninsecurity to domestic governments, but it also threatens the global security. Peoples who do not get food, water, employment, access to farm lands and other basic needs \nget angry and frustrated, and thus more likely to resort to violence and conflict. The \npeople who are domestically suffering by the turmoil and uncertainty of the disordered and unstable world have important role in motivating people to migrate abroad to search a better life. The revolution in communications and transportation has made people aware of conditions and opportunities in other parts of the world, as well as \nmaking travel to those areas.\nNowadays, migrants and refugees to most advanced countries are becoming the \ntarget of animosity and racism from fundamentalist groups who blame them for the \nhigh level of unemployment and decline in general living standards. This results in \nexclusion of migrants from political, social, and economic spheres by the extremists. As a result those migrants who feel excluded and segregated are likely to join and work with terrorist groups to revenge racists. This results in political insecurity in the host countries.\nActivity 8.8\n ☑Why is population explosion becoming a global issue?"

It is one of the biggest issues facing the international community today. Unemployment locks people in poverty. It makes people less able to generate economic growth in the future, as people lose skills and become unemployed. It perpetuates inequality, with a disproportionate amount of wealth owned by a small minority of the population. It also affects social stability: in many developing countries developing conflicts, uprisings and unrests can be caused due to high youth unemployment.\nHaving significant number of people out of work can negatively impact a community’s \neconomic growth and development. It can have serious social repercussions because of unemployed people tend to feel also left out, leading to social exclusion, anxiety and lack of hope for the future. Given that people live in poor nations, not feeling that a better life is possible can result in people floundering in poverty and frustration, bringing fragile states down with them. Unemployment is a driver for exclusion and marginalization, with consequences including crime, drug trafficking and use, juvenile delinquency, family breakdown, domestic violence, and migration in search for better opportunities. Meaningful employment is essential for human dignity and a place in the community. It works in a spirit of service to the community and has important benefits including refining human character and empowering individuals to develop their human potential.\nE. Disease\nGrowth in travel and migration helped the spread diseases, for instance HIV/AIDS and recently Covid-19. Such diseases were first found in America and China respectively, now the epidemic is spreading rapidly to new locations and affects peoples all over the world. AIDS has become a poor person’s disease, taking a heavy toll on life expectancy, reversing the gains of recent decades."
