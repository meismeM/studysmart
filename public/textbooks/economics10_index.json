            "text": "IIntroduction to the Book\nThis book is intended for grade 10 students in Ethiopia. Economics starts at grade 9, \nthus this book is subsequent to that. Students will learn subsequent content similar  to that of the previous grade. Accordingly, there is a little depth and width in terms of theories and applications. \nThe book has eight units. The first unit deals with the Theory of Consumer Behavior, \nunder which students will learn from the definition of utility up to an illustration of the optimum of the consumer using the cardinal utility approach. The second unit deals with the Theories of Demand and Supply, in which students will learn from evaluating the effects of changes in demand and supply on equilibrium price and quantity to computing elasticities of demand and supply. \nThe third unit covers the Theory of Production and Cost, in which students will learn \neverything from short- and long-run production to cost of production mapping.\nThe fourth unit deals with the market structures, under which students will discuss \nvarious concepts, from basic features of different markets to understanding the sources of monopoly power. \nThe fifth Unit deals with Theories of Banking and Finance, with in which students will \nlearn various concepts from the Financial Intermediaries up to the role of indigenous financial institutions such as Iqub and Idir. The Sixth Unit deals with the theories and measurements of Economic Growth with in which students will learn various economic growth concepts, from explaining how to measure economic growth  to discussing about productivity, measurements in economics. \nThe seventh unit deals with discussing the overview of the Ethiopian Economy in which \nvarious economic situations in Ethiopia will be discussed, from the main sectors of the Ethiopian economy up to being able to write a brief report on Ethiopian economy. The eighth unit deals with Innovation and business startups in which students will learn various business concepts, from defining the term innovation up to conducting  a strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) analysis of an existing enterprise.\nEach unit begins with an introduction that states the lessons and the outcomes. It \nalso provides a list of the key words and concepts you will encounter in the unit. The objectives are listed at the beginning of each lesson. The start-up activities are to introduce you to the lesson. On many pages, you will find tables and figures that illustrate the topic you are studying. There are also examples  thataim to elaborate on  the concept you are studying. Each lesson has at least one set of questions linked to the objective of the lesson. At the end of each unit, there is a unit summary of what you have read. This will help you revise. Finally, unit review exercises enable you to test your knowledge and understanding of the unit content. \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

            "text": "IIIn learning the economic literature throughout all the units included in this book, \nthere are two things expected from both the teacher and the students. First they should understand the basic theoretical background of each unit. A teacher should understand the theories before starting to teach the students. For this, s/he has to refer to the reference lists indicated at the end of the student text or teacher’s guide. The second thing is that students should try to associate the theories with the practical situation in their country. This can be accomplished via the different activities and also by examples that the teacher makes the students exercise. \nFinally, this book is just one resource that students will use to learn economics at this \nlevel.

Utility is \nthe level of satisfaction or pleasure derived from the consumption of a good or service. Thus, utility is the power of a commodity to satisfy human wants. For example, bread has the power to satisfy hunger, while water quenches our thirst. \nIn defining utility, it is important to bear in mind the following points:\nyRelativity of Utility:  The utility of a commodity is subjective to a person’s \nneeds. It is not absolute (objectively determined).The same commodity provides different utilities to different consumers. For example, non-smokers do not derive any utility from cigarettes. \nyThe utility of a product can be different at different places and times. For example, the utility that we get from wearing jackets during the cold season is not the same as during the hot season. For the same consumer, utility varies from unit to unit, from time to time, and from place to place. For example, the utility we get from drinking tea early in the morning may be different from the utility we get during lunch time.\ny‘Utility’ and ‘usefulness’ are not synonymous: usefulness is the concern of a \nproduct whereas utility is the concern of the consumer.\nApproaches to measuring Utility:Since utility is a qualitative concept, it is difficult \nto measure quantitatively, but economists try to quantify it in two different ways: cardinal utility and ordinal utility.\nĂActivity 1.1\n1.

How do you measure the satisfaction level (utility) that you get from goods \nand services?\nTo get a higher level of satisfaction, the consumer must be able to compare the utility of \nthe various baskets of goods that can be bought with the available income. According to Cardinal Utility theory, utility is measurable like weight, height, and temperature, and they suggested a unit of measurement of satisfaction called ‘utils’ . The Cardinal \nSchool postulated that utility can be measured in monetary units (i.e., by the amount of money that the consumer is willing to pay for another unit of a commodity) or by subjective units called ‘utils’. Thus, the school assumes that the level of utility can be expressed in numbers.\n       1.2.1. Assumptions of Cardinal Utility Theory\nI . The consumer is Rational: The main objective of the consumer is to maximize \nhis/her satisfaction given his/her limited budget or income. Thus, in order to \nmaximize his/her satisfaction, the consumer has to be rational.\nII . Cardinal Utility : Utility is a cardinal concept, which means the utility of each \ncommodity is measurable, with the most convenient measure being money.\nIII . Constant Marginal Utility of money : the utility that one derives from each \nsuccessive unit of money income remains constant.\nIV . Diminishing Marginal Utility : The utility gained from the successive units of \na commodity diminishes. In other words, the marginal utility of a commodity diminishes as the consumer consumes larger quantities of it. This is the law of diminishing marginal utility.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

If there are n commodities in the bundle with quantities X 1 , X 2 \n,...X n , the total utility is given by TU = f ( X1 ,  X 2; …… Xn).\n1.2.2. Measurement of Utility (Total and Marginal Utility) \nTotal Utility (TU): refers to the total amount of satisfaction a consumer gets from \nconsuming or possessing some specific quantities of a commodity (X) at a particular time. As the consumer consumes more of a good (X) per time period, his/her total utility increases. However, there is a saturation point for that commodity after which the consumer will not be capable of enjoying any greater satisfaction from it. Therefore, TUn refers to the total utility derived from consuming n units of a commodity X.\nMarginal Utility(MU): refers to the additional utility obtained from consuming an additional unit of a commodity. In other words, marginal utility is the change in total utility resulting from the consumption of one more unit of a product per unit of time. Mathematically, the formula for marginal utility is:\nQTUMU Where,   TU is the change in total utility, and,\n                      Q ischange in the amount of product consumed. \nSuppose Beka gets 10 utils of total utility by consuming 2 quantities of orange, and his total utility increases to 12 utils as he consumes 3 quantities of orange. Thus, consumption of the 3\nrd quantity of orange has caused total utility to increase by 2 utils \n(12 utils minus 10 utils).

How should a consumer spend \nhis/her income on different commodities?\nA consumer that maximizes utility reaches his/her equilibrium position when the \nallocation of his/her expenditure is such that the last birr spent on each commodity yields the same utility. \nA consumer budget (income) is the actual purchasing potential with which a consumer \ncan purchase a set of goods or services, provided their prices. A consumer has limited income therefore the consumer’s budget shows the number of goods and services he/she can afford.\nAssumptions : Economists have developed the concept of consumer equilibrium \nbased on the following assumptions.\nyThe consumer is rational. She/he aims at the maximisation of her/his utility or \nsatisfaction, \nyCardinal measurement of utility is possible, \nyIf utility is measured in terms of money, the marginal utility of money remains constant, \nyThe law of diminishing marginal utility operates, \nyThe Consumer income is given and remains constant, \nyCommodity prices given and remain constant.\nI . Consumer Equilibrium:The Case of one commodity\nLet’s assume that the consumer consumes a single commodity, X. The consumer can \neither buy x or retain his money income Y . Under these conditions, the consumer is in equilibrium when the marginal utility of X is equated to its market price (p\nx).\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Introduction to the Ordinal Utility Theory\nAt the end of this section, students will be able to:\n6Explain ordinal utility\n6State the assumptions of  ordinal utility theory\nKey Concepts\nOrdinal utility\nStartup Activity\n1. Suppose you have just eaten an orange and a banana. Can you tell how much \nyou are satisfied with each of these items? \nYou can probably tell which item you liked more. But, it is very difficult to express \n“how much” you liked one over the other. In the ordinal utility approach, utility cannot be measured absolutely, but different consumption bundles are ranked according to preferences. The concept is based on the fact that it may not be possible for consumers to express the utility of various commodities they consume in absolute terms, like, 1 util, 2 util, or 3 util, but it is always possible for consumers to express the utility in relative terms. It is practically possible for the consumers to rank commodities in the order of their preference, as 1\nst, 2nd, 3rd, and so on.\nThat is, to make his/her choice, the consumer needs not know the utility of various commoditiesin a specific unit, but be able to rank the various baskets of goods (order of preference) according to the satisfaction that each bundle gives.\nAssumptions\nyRationality: The consumer is assumed to be rational. The main objective of \nrational consumer is to maximize his/her satisfaction or utility given his/her income and market prices.\nyUtility is ordinal: utility is not absolutely (cardinally) measurable. The consumer can rank his/her preference (order the various baskets of goods) according to the satisfaction of each basket.\nyThe Diminishing marginal rate of substitution (DMRS): The marginal rate of substitution is the rate at which a consumer is willing to substitute one commodity for another commodity so that his/her total satisfaction remains the same. The rate at which one good can be substituted for another in a consumer‘s basket of goods diminishes as the consumer consumes more and more of the good. This means that as the consumer substitutes more and more of one commodity (say \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Utility is the power of a commodity to satisfy human wants. There are two approaches for the measurement of utility: the Cardinal Utility and Ordinal utility approaches. \nThe cardinal utility approach argues that utility is measurable and quantifiable with \na unit of measurement of ‘utils’ while the ordinal utility approach argues that utility has only ordinal value and could only be ordered and ranked. The law of diminishing marginal utility states that as the amount consumed of a commodity increase, the utility derived by the consumer from the additional units (marginal utility) goes on decreasing. \nUnder the cardinal utility approach, the consumer reaches equilibrium when the \nmarginal utility of the commodity is equal to its price in the case of one commodity (MU\nx = Px), and when the ratio of the marginal utilities of the commodities to their \nprices is equal for all commodities.\nIn the ordinal utility approach, utility cannot be measured absolutely, but different \nconsumption bundles are ranked according to preferences. The concept is based on the fact that it may not be possible for consumers to express the utility of various commodities they consume in absolute terms, like, 1 util, 2 util, or 3 util, but it is always possible for consumers to express the utility in relative terms.

There, we asserted that prices were determined by the “interaction” between demand and supply in these markets.  In this unit we examine that interaction in detail explaining how prices and output quantities are determined, determinates and elasticies of demand and supply. \nMarket is a place, condition, or mechanism, which brings together both buyers \n(demanders) and sellers (suppliers) in order to exchange their goods and services. All situations which link potential buyers with potential sellers are markets. Thus, the market means the system in which sellers and buyers of a commodity interact to settle its price and the quantity to be bought and sold.\nUnit ObjectivesAfter completing this unit, students will be able to:\n6Explain the theory of demand.\n6Describe the theory of supply\n6Identify factors that affect demand and supply\n6Distinguish between individual and market demand \n6Distinguish between individual and market supply \n6Demonstrate market equilibrium both graphically and mathematically\n6Evaluate the effect of changes in demand and supply on equilibrium price \nand quantity.\n6Define elasticity\n6Calculate and interpret the different types of elasticity\nMain Contents\n     2.1.

Discuss the similarities \nand differences in pairs.\nIn the previous unit, we studied and derived the consumer’s optimum given income, \nthe price of the goods and preferences. The demand for a commodity is the quantity that consumers are able and willing to buy at various prices during a given period of time.\nDefinition: Demand means the ability and willingness to buy a specific quantity of a \ncommodity at the prevailing price in a given period of time. Therefore, demand for a \ncommodity implies a desire to acquire it, along with the willingness and ability to pay for it. Thus, Demand = Willingness to buy + Ability to pay.\n   2.1.1 The Demand Schedule, Demand Function  and the Demand Curve\nDemand could be expressed in the form of schedules, functions, or curves.  Demand Schedule is a table showing different quantities of commodity that consumer is willing to buy at different level of prices, during a given period of time. Demand expresses the nature of functional relationship between the price of a commodity and its quantity demanded.  Q\nd=f(P)=a-bP ;whereas ‘Qd‘ is quantity demanded, ‘P’ is price, ‘a’ is \nconstant, ‘b’ coefficient of price,  As quantity is function of price, or these variables are expressed in tabular form/ schedules, and can be transformed into curves.

That is, the function has a negative slope, or the curve slopes downward. This important property is given the name of downward sloping demand. The law of demand can be stated as, all other things remaining constant, the quantity demanded of a commodity increases when its price decreases and decreases when its price increases.\n2.1.2 Factors affecting demand\nDeterminants of demand are factors that cause the consumer to increase or decrease their demand for a particular commodity. Demand is a multi-variety function in a sense that it is determined by many factors/variables. There are various factors affecting the demand for a commodity. Some of these are:\nyPrice of the good: the price of a commodity is an important determinant of \ndemand. Price and demand are inversely related. The higher the price, the lower the demand and vice versa.\nyPrice of related goods: the price of related goods like substitutes and complementary goods also affect the demand. \n\tSubstitute goods are goods that can be used in place of each other to satisfy \na given want. (For example, coffee and tea, pens and pencils, butter and oil, etc.).\n\tComplementary goods are goods used together to satisfy a given want. (For example, tea and sugar, phone and sim-card, cars and petrol, gun and bullet etc.)\nIn the case of substitutes, rise in the price of one commodity leads to an increase in the demand for its substitute. In the case of complementary goods, a fall in the price of one commodity leads to a rise in demand for both the goods.\nyConsumer income: is directly related to demand. A change in the consumer’s \nincome significantly influences his demand for most commodities. If the consumers’ income increases, demand will be greater.\nyTaste and habits: these are very effective factors affecting demand for a commodity. When there is a change in the consumer’s taste, habits, or preferences, their demand will change.\nyPopulation: if the size of the population is greater, demand for goods will be greater. The market demand for a commodity substantially changes when there is a change in the total population.\nySeason: The demand for a commodity is also affected by the season. For \nexample, demand for woolen clothes increases in the cold seasons. On the other \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

The cause of such a change is an increase or decrease in the price of the product being considered. Downward movement along the demand curve is called an extension of demand, while the upward movement is a contraction of demand.\nFigure 2.2: Extension of demand                Figure 2.3: Contraction of Demand                                                           \nChange in Demand: A change in one or more of the determinants of demand (other than their own price) will change the demand data (the demand schedule). A change in the demand schedule, or more graphically, a shift in the location of the demand curve, \nis called a change in demand. An increase in demand causes the demand curve to shift upward to the right; whereas, a decrease in demand causes the demand curve to shift downward to the left.  In other words, while an increase in demand is explained by an outward shift of the demand curve, a decrease in demand is explained by an inward shift of the demand curve. \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

The factors affecting \ndemand, except for their own price, are called shifting factors.\n2.1.4 Derivation of market demand\nBased on the number of consumer, demand is classified as individual demand and \nmarket demand.\nIndividual Demand: Individual demand may be defined as the quantity of a \ncommodity that a person is willing and able to buy at given prices over a specified period of time. Suppose Mr. Adamu purchases a kg of banana when the price is Birr 25, and he purchases 2 kg for a week when the price drops to Birr 20. And when the price further decreases to Birr 15 per kg, he buys 3 kg banana for a week, but when the price rises to Birr 30 per kg, he buys zero kg of banana.

The market demand for the commodity is simply the horizontal summation of the demand of all the consumers in the market. In other words, the quantity demanded in the market at each price is the sum of the individual demands of all consumers at that price.\nAssume that there are three consumers (say A, B, and C) in the market for a particular \nD0\nD1\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Supply may be defined as the various amounts of a product that a producer (firm) is willing and able to produce and make available for sale in the market over  a specific time period, at given prices, ceteris paribus. Holding other factors constant, the quantity supplied of a good or service is the amount offered for sale at a given price. \n2.2.1. Supply function, Supply schedule, and Supply curve \nA Supply function: is a statement that states the relationship between the quantity supplied (as a dependent variable) and its determinants (say price, as independent variable). Suppose that a single producer’s supply function for commodity X is given as: Q\nX =F(PX)=a+bP, ceteris paribus.\nThe supply schedule: is a tabular presentation of the (law of) supply. By substituting \nvarious “relevant” prices of X into the above supply equation, we get the producer’s supply schedule shown in table 2.4 below.\n   Table 2.4 supply schedule\nPrice per unit (in Birr/kg) 0 10 15 22 35 43 56 67 78 106\nQuantity supplied (in kg) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Plotting each pair \nof values from the supply schedule in the table above on a graph and joining the \nresulting points we get the producer’s supply curve, figure 2.6 below.\nTable 2.4 illustrates that there is a positive relationship between the quantity supplied \nand its price. As we can see, the supplier requires a minimum price to start supplying its product, and then increases its quantities as the unit price for its product rises, and vice versa.\nFigure 2.6 is a graphic representation of the supply schedule where, conventionally, \nthe price of the product is shown on the vertical axis and the quantity supplied on the horizontal axis. The curve is, more or less functional in accordance with the law of supply, which states that, in general, the higher the price of a good, the greater the quantity of the good suppliers are willing and able to make available in the market.\nThe slope of a supply curve : the Law of supply expresses the direct relationship \nbetween the prices of a commodity and its quantity supplied. Price and supply are \npositively related. Hence, the slope of the supply curve is positive. \n 2.2.2 Changes in quantity supplied and changes in supply\nA change in quantity supplied: as we stated earlier, as the price of a goods increases, the quantity supplied increases. We call this kind of movement along the supply curve a “change in quantity supplied.”  Thus, movement along the supply curve is caused by a change in the commodity’s own price. In such a situation, the supply curve remains the same. Other things being constant, the movement along the (same) supply curve is caused by a change in the price of the good. For example, movement from A to B, B to C, C to A, etc., refers to a change in quantity supplied. \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Have you ever heard of the term ‘Equilibrium’? What comes to your mind \nwhenever you hear the term ‘Equilibrium’?\nIn a general sense, the term ‘equilibrium’ means the “state of rest”. In the context \nof market analysis, equilibrium refers to the market condition that once achieved, tends to persist. This condition occurs when the quantity demanded of the commodity equals the quantity supplied of the commodity. This equality produces an equilibrium price (market- clearing price).\n2.3.1. The derivation of equilibrium\nHaving seen the theory of demand and supply, we can now bring them together to see how the buying decisions of households and the selling decisions of firms interact to determine the price of a product and the quantity actually bought and sold. Market equilibrium explains the balance between demand and supply for a commodity.  That is, equilibrium occurs when the quantity demanded by the buyers equals the quantity supplied by the sellers in a particular market, so that the market clears.  It is a condition that once it is achieved, tends to persist because economic agents have no incentive to change their behavior. \nThe price level at which the market reaches equilibrium is called the ‘market clearing/ \nequilibrium price’, and the corresponding quantity is called the ‘equilibrium quantity”. The equilibrium price in a free market is determined by the market forces of demand and supply. Suppose that the market demand and supply schedules are given as shown in the table below:\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

When the price of a \nshirt is, say, Birr 15, the quantity demanded is 4 units of shirts, but the quantity supplied is only 2 units of shirts. The result is a shortage of 2 units of shirts. Thus, unsatisfied buyers will bid the price up. Raising the price will reduce the shortage. If, however, the price of shirts rose to, say, Birr 25 per shirt, the quantity supplied is 4 units of shirts while the amount demanded is only 2 units of shirts. The result is a surplus of 2 units of shirts. This surplus will cause the price of shirts to fall as unsatisfied sellers bid the price down. As the price falls, the surplus will diminish. Thus, as the table shows, there is only one price of shirts (Birr 20) at which the market is in equilibrium, i.e. the quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal at 3 units of shirts. At all other prices, the shirt market is in disequilibrium.\nWe have already seen that a surplus causes prices to decline and a shortage causes \nprices to rise. With neither shortage nor surplus (at Br.20), there is no reason for the actual price of shirts to move away from this price. The economists call this the equilibrium price: ‘equilibrium’ means “in balance” or “at rest”. Graphically: this is the price at which the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.\nFigure 2.10 Market equilibrium\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

The shortage of shirts that would exist below the equilibrium price and the surplus that occurs above the equilibrium price. In a free market, disequilibrium itself creates the condition for equilibrium.\n2.3.2. The concepts of excess demand and excess supply\nExcess demand occurs when the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied, which leads to a shortage in the market. Excess supply occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, resulting in a market surplus.\nFigure 2.11 Excess demand and Excess Supply\nTherefore, graphically, the intersection of the supply and demand curves for a product indicates the market equilibrium (Q\n*, P*).  Any price above this intersection will lead \nto a surplus because sellers will be willing to offer more of the commodity in the market while the buyers cut their demand.  On the other hand, any price below the intersection point will discourage the suppliers and reduce the quantity supplied in the market while buyers are willing to buy more, indicating that there is a shortage.  However, there is always a tendency for movement towards the equilibrium point.  That is, when there is a surplus, there is a tendency for prices to move downward, and when there is a shortage there is a tendency for price to move upward.  \nExample: If the market demand and supply functions of wheat are given as                             \nQd = 80 – 3P and\nQs = 9P -40, respectively.

A commodity with fewer substitutes has relatively inelastic demand.\nyPeople with high incomes are less affected by price changes than people with low incomes.\nyProportion of income spent on the commodity: When a small part of income is spent on the commodity, the price change does not affect the demand.

            "text": "Unit 2: Theories of Demand and Supply44Unit Summary\nDemand for a commodity refers to the amount that will be purchased at a particular \nprice during a particular period of time. The demand curve shows how the quantity of a good demanded depends on the price. According to the law of demand, as the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded also rises. Therefore, the demand curve slopes downward.\nIn addition to price, other determinants of the quantity demanded included the income \nof the consumer, the prices of substitutes and complements, consumer tastes and preferences, consumer expectation, the number of consumers in the market, etc. If one of these other determinants changes, it leads to demand curve shifts. Individual demand for a commodity is the amount purchased by a single consumer at a given price during a particular period of time; while market demand is the horizontal summation of individual demand.\nIn a market, while buyers of a product constitute the demand side of the market, \nsellers of that product make up the supply side of the market. Supply may be defined as a schedule, equation or a curve that shows the various amounts of a product that a producer (firm) is willing and able to produce and make available for sale in the market over a specific time period, at given prices, ceteris paribus. Holding other factors constant, the quantity supplied of a good or service is the amount offered for sale at a given price. \nThe supply curve shows how the quantity of a good supplied depends on the price. \nAccording to the law of supply, as the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied also rises. Therefore, the supply curve slopes upward. In addition to price, other determinants of the quantity supplied include input prices, technology, and expectations. If one of these other determinants changes, it causes the supply curve to shift. \nThe intersection of the supply and demand curves determines the market equilibrium. \nAt the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. The behavior of buyers and sellers naturally drives markets toward equilibrium. When the market price is above the equilibrium price, there is a surplus of the good, which causes the market price to fall. When the market price is below the equilibrium price, \nthere is a shortage, which causes the market price to rise.\nElasticity of demand refers to the degree of responsiveness of the quantity demanded \nof a commodity to changes in any of its determinants.

How do you define ‘production’? What is needed to undertake production?\nIntroduction\nProduction is a scientific process that involves the transformation of raw materials \n(inputs) into desired products or services (outputs) by adding economic value. Production of goods and services involves transforming resources such as labor power, raw materials, services, and machines into finished products.\nFigure 3.1 Production\n3.1.1 Production Function \nThe production function is a function that shows the highest output that a firm can produce for every specified combination of inputs. In particular, the production \nfunction tells us the quantity of output the firm can produce given quantities of the inputs that it might employ. Assuming labor (L) and capital (K) as the only inputs, mathematically, the production function can be written as: Q = f (L,K).The production function allows inputs to be combined in varying proportions so that output can be produced in many ways (using either more capital or less labor or vice versa).\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

In the real world, \nland and capital (such as plants and equipment) are usually treated as fixed factors. The long run is the period of time (planning horizon) which is sufficient when all quantities of inputs are variable. Here we are considering a simple production process with only two factors. We treat capital as the fixed factor, and labor as the variable factor.\nProduction with one variable input: Production with one variable input (while the \nothers are fixed) is obviously a short run phenomenon. So, let’s now consider a farmer \nproducing wheat.  To the farmer, the only variable input is assumed to be labor, and all other inputs, like land, capital, and technology, are fixed inputs.  \nThat is to say:   \n𝑄𝑄=𝐹𝐹(𝐿𝐿,𝐿𝐿̅𝑎𝑎,𝐾𝐾,̅𝑇𝑇̅)\nWhere, Q=Quantity (output), L = Labor, La = Land, K = Capital, T = Technology, and \nthe bar implies constant. So the short run production function tells us only the effect \nof a change in the farmer’s labor on the production of wheat, while keeping the size of land, capital, and technology constant.\nThe following are the three basic concepts of the production function:\nÖ Total physical product (total product) (TP)\nÖ Average physical product (Average product) (AP)\nÖ Marginal physical product (marginal product) (MP)\nTotal product (TP): refers to the total output produced by a given amount of a variable \ninput, keeping the quantity of other (fixed) inputs constant. It is the overall amount of output produced by the factors of production employed over a given period.\nAverage Product (AP):  To calculate the average product (AP), the total product is \ndivided by the number of units of that input. Suppose in the production of wheat, \nthe AP of a farmer is obtained by dividing the total output by the number of workers employed. \nThis can be put in the form of:    AP\nL=Total product\nNumber of workers=𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇\n𝐿𝐿\nWhere APL denotes Average Product of Labor, TP denotes Total Product, and L denotes \nLabor. An average product measures the output per worker, which is an indication of \nthe productivity of the input. \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

In other words, the MP is the percentage change in total output resulting \nfrom a percentage change in variable input, all other things being equal. \nMathematically,  MP L=Change intotal product\nChange innumber of workers=∆𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇\n∆𝐿𝐿\nAs a result, the marginal product (MP) is equal to the slope of the total product (TP). \nGenerally, we can say that the three, i.e. total product (TP), marginal product (MP), and average product (AP), are interrelated.\n3.1.2.1. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Productivity \nIn any production function with a fixed level of some of the inputs, it is impossible to expand the level of production indefinitely. Initially, as more of the variable inputs are employed together with the fixed ones, the output level increases dramatically to a certain extent, i.e. the marginal contribution of one more variable input (say, labor) increases sharply. But as the number of labor employed increases with a fixed capital, the production capacity goes to exhaustion and eventually the total output declines, i.e. the additional contribution of extra laborers employed becomes a loss or negative. Therefore, according to the law of diminishing returns, increasing the amount of the variable factor (labor) with the fixed factor (capital) will lead to an eventual decline in the marginal contribution of the additional labor to the total output. This is also accompanied by an eventual decline in total output.\n3.1.2.2 Stages of production \nAssume capital is fixed. The production function shows different levels of output that the firm can obtain by efficiently utilizing different units of labor. In the short run production function above, the quantity of capital is fixed. Thus, output can change only when the amount of labor used for production changes. Hence, total production (TP) or total quantity (Q) is a function of labor (L). Now let us take a hypothetical \nexample (table 3.1) that explains how a farmer  can produce  wheat on  fixed land (one \nhectare of land) by changing only the amount of labor.    \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

In our earlier discussion of the short \nrun production function and stages of production, we assumed labor as a variable input \nand capital as a fixed input. Now we turn to the long–term analysis of production. Remember that, long run is a period of time (planning horizon) which is sufficient for the firm to change the quantity of all inputs. \nIn order to produce an output, a firm may require any number of different inputs. \nAssume, however, that a firm produces output using only two factors of production: labor and capital. With both factors variable, a firm can usually produce a given level of output by combining different amounts of labor and capital. The output from the various combinations of inputs can be shown by using isoquant.\nIsoquant\nAn isoquant is a curve that shows all possible efficient combinations of inputs that can yield equal level of output. If both labor and capital are variable inputs, the production function will have the following form.\n   Q = f (L, K); given this production function, the equation of an isoquant, where \noutput is held constant at    Q is   Q = f (L, K)\nThus, isoquants show the flexibility that firms have when making production decision: \nthey usually obtain a particular output (Q) by substituting one input for the other. The production isoquant may assume different shapes depending on the degree of substitutability of factors. However, most of the time, the smooth or convex isoquant is used in the traditional economic theory, and we shall consider it in this section.\nAn isoquant schedule: is a tabular representation of the various combinations of \ntwo variable inputs that give the same level of output. Suppose that a firm seeks to produce 100 units of output by using two variable inputs, L and K (say, labor and capital, respectively). It can do so by employing different combinations of L and K. The hypothetical table 3.2 shows the different combinations the firm could make to produce the given level of output.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

When a \nproduction function exhibits diminishing marginal rate of technical substitution (i.e., when the MRTS\nL,K along an isoquant decreases as the quantity of labor L increases), \nthe isoquants are convex to the origin (i.e., bowed in toward the origin).\nReturns to Scale\nIn the previous section, we explored the extent to which inputs could be substituted for each other to produce a given level of output. In this section, we study how increases in all input quantities affect the quantity of output the firm can produce.  When inputs have positive marginal products, a firm’s total output must increase when the quantities of all inputs are increased simultaneously—that is, when a firm’s scale of operations increases. Often, though, we might want to know by how much output will increase when all inputs are increased by a given percentage amount. \nIn the long run, where all inputs are variable, output can be increased by changing all \nfactors by the same proportion. The concept of returns to scale tells us the percentage increase in output when a firm increases all of its input quantities by a given percentage amount. We have three cases of returns to scale: increasing, constant, and decreasing returns to scale.\nyIncrease returns to scale: this is the case where increasing all factors by the \nsame proportion ‘m’ leads to an increase in output by more than ‘m’ scale.\nyConstant returns to scale: if we increase input by some factor ‘m’ and output is increased by the same proportion as inputs ‘m’ then it is called constant returns to scale. In this case, the size of the firm’s operation doesn’t affect the productivity of its factors.\nyDecreasing returns to scale: When scaling up all inputs by ‘m’ results in a scaling up of output by less than ‘m’, this is referred to as decreasing returns to scale . This is because difficulties in organizing and running a large scale \noperation may lead to decreased production of both labor and capital.\n3.1.4 Technology Change and the Position of Product ion Curves\nTechnological change (progress) makes factors of production more productive or the production system more efficient so that the firm will get higher output from the same combinations of labor and capital than before. Figure 3.5 shows upward movement of \nthe total product curve indicating higher output level can be achieved from the same input after technological advancement. \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

In short run based fixed and variable inputs, total cost (TC) is divided into two parts:\nTotal Fixed Cost (TFC): TFC is a cost that does not vary with the level of output \n(it does not change with change in quantity of output).Thus, it is independent of output. Fixed costs consists costs such as: salaries of administrative staff, expenses for building depreciation and repairs, etc. \nTotal variable cost (TVC): TVC is a cost that varies as output varies.

The ATC curve slopes downward up to output OQ2, shows a decrease, and slopes upward beyond output OQ2, indicating an increase in average total cost.

The time period corresponding to the long run will be such a condition that the producers can make all the necessary changes to the size of the plant. For the analysis of the long-run cost of production, we use only three types of curves: the Long- Run Total Cost Curve (LTC), the Long-Run Average Cost Curve (LAC), and the Long- Run Marginal Cost Curve (LMC). Here also, LAC and LMC curves are U-shaped, but they are flatter than the short-run cost curves.\nIf we consider the case, the total cost first increases at a deceasing rate due to increasing \nreturns to scale (which implies economies of scale). With an increasing rate attributed to decreasing returns to scale after the optimum size, the long-run total cost curve will look like the following.

A Total Product (TP) refers to the total amount of a commodity produced during some period of time by combining different factors of production. The average product (AP) of a variable factor refers to the output per unit of the variable factor. The marginal product (MP) of a variable factor may be defined as the change in total product resulting from the additional unit of a variable factor.\nReturns to a factor mean a change in the physical output of a good when the quantity \nof one factor is increased while the quantity of other factors remains constant. The law of diminishing marginal returns states that in all production processes, adding more of one factor of production while holding one or more of the other inputs constant will at some point yield lower per unit returns.\nDiminishing returns occur in the short run when one factor is fixed. Technological \nchange shifts the production function upward. The cost of production depends on several factors, such as the quantity of production, the level of technology and input prices. In the short run, one or more of a firm’s inputs are fixed. Thus, the total cost of production can be divided into fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are constant regardless of the level of output. A firm cannot avoid fixed costs by producing zero levels of output. Variable costs, on the other hand, vary with the level of output directly. By dividing the total cost and total variable costs for the quantity of production, we obtain an average cost (AC) respectively.\nIn the short run, when not all inputs are variable, the AC and A VC curves assume \na U- shape due to the law of variable proportions. Marginal costs of production are additional costs incurred to produce one more unit of a commodity. The MC curve has a U-shape due to the law of variable proportions. The short-run marginal and average variable cost curves are a mirror reflection of the marginal product and the average product of the variable input, respectively. In the long run, all the inputs to the production process are variable. As a result, the choice of inputs depends both on the relative costs of a factor of production and on the extent to which the firm can substitute among inputs in its production process.\nIn the long run, all the inputs to the production process are variable.

How do you define a perfectly competitive market?\nIn microeconomics, perfect competition describes a market in which a buyer or seller \nhas no market power or where all buyers and sellers are price takers. It is this distinction that differentiates perfectly competitive markets from imperfectly competitive ones. In short, a perfectly competitive market is characterized by the fact that no single firm has any influence on the price of the product it sells. For instance, consider a farmers market where each seller sells the same type of products (such as maize). There is little differentiation between each of their products, and they each sell them at an equal price. At the same time, sellers and buyers free to participate in the market without any barrier. \n4.1.1 The Characteristics of Perfect Competition\nA perfectly competitive market has several distinguishing characteristics. The main features include:\nThe market has a large number of buyers and sellers: a perfect competitive market \nis composed of a large number of buyers and sellers of a commodity, so that the \nbuying or selling decision of a single buyer or seller cannot affect the price of the commodity. That is, the actions of a single seller or buyer cannot influence the market price of the commodity, since the firm or buyer) is too small in relation to the market.\nHomogeneity of products: products supplied by the different firms are the same or \nhomogenous. For example, salt supplied by two sellers is identical to the extent that \nbuyers are unable to differentiate which firm supplied which product. The assumption of a large number of sellers and product homogeneity together imply that an individual firm operating in a perfectly competitive market is a price taker.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Because no single buyer or seller can influence the price of wheat, each takes the price as given.\nFree entry and exit: in a perfectly competitive market, a new firm has the freedom \nto produce and supply a product. In other words, firms have freedom of movement or there is no barrier that restricts firms’ entry into and/or exit out of a perfectly competitive market. If the firm believes that it is not worth staying in the business, it can go out of the market.\nPerfect Information for Both Consumers and Producers: it is assumed that in a \nperfectly competitive market, both sellers and buyers have complete information and \nknowledge of the market. Every buyer and seller has full knowledge of the product quality and its nature, current and future prices, input prices, and other attributes that are certainly known.\nFirms Aim to Maximize Profit: the objective of firms in perfect competition is profit \nmaximization. Firms try to increase revenue and reduce (minimize) costs so as to \nincrease profit.\n4.1.2 Perfect competition demand and revenue functions\na. Demand \nThe assumption of a large number of sellers and product homogeneity together imply that an individual firm operating in a perfectly competitive market is a price taker.\n        \nFigure 4.2: The demand curve faced by a firm in a perfectly competitive market\nyThus, a competitive firm faces a completely horizontal demand curve for its product, indicating that it can sell any amount of output only at the ongoing market price (P).

Hence, the \ndemand curve that the firm faces in this market situation is a horizontal line drawn at the equilibrium price, p*.\nb. Revenue Function\nThe revenues of a firm are the receipts that it obtains from selling its products. Revenues have three main categories: Total Revenue (TR), Average Revenue (AR), and Marginal Revenue (MR).\nyTotal Revenue (TR): total revenue is the total amount of money received by a company from the sale of a specific quantity of its product. It is obtained by multiplying the unit price of the commodity and the quantity of that product sold.\nTR=P \nX Q; where P = price of the product\n                                  Q = quantity of the product sold.\nyAverage revenue (AR): is the revenue per unit of item sold.  It is calculated by \ndividing the total revenue by the amount of the product sold, i.e.       \n𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴=𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇\n𝑄𝑄=𝑃𝑃∗𝑄𝑄\n𝑄𝑄    =>𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴= P\nNote that average revenue (AR) and the price of the product (P) have the same meaning. Average revenue means the per unit revenue received by the seller from the sale of the commodity. On the other hand, price means the per unit payment made by the purchaser to purchase the commodity. Since the seller receives what the purchaser pays, the per unit revenue and per unit price are the same. That is why the AR curve and demand curve for a firm’s product are also the same. Therefore, from the firm’s viewpoint, the firm’s demand curve is also the average revenue curve.\nyMarginal Revenue: Marginal revenue is the change in total revenue resulting from one unit increase in sales. It is the additional amount of money or revenue the firm receives by selling one more unit of the product. It is calculated as the ratio of the change in total revenue to the change in the sale of the product, i.e. \n𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀=∆𝑇𝑇𝑀𝑀\n∆𝑄𝑄=∆(𝑃𝑃∗𝑄𝑄)\n∆𝑄𝑄\nThus, in a perfectly competitive market, a firm’s average revenue, marginal revenue, and price of the product are equal, i.e. AR = MR = P = D\nfirm. Marginal revenue can \nalso be estimated as the change in total revenue with the sale of ‘n’ units of a product \ninstead of (n – 1) units.  Thus,  MR = TRn– TR n – 1\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

What is a “pure monopoly market”? Discuss the topic in pairs. \nThe second market structure in which we analyze the interaction between producers \nand consumers is that of a pure monopoly. The term “monopoly” is derived from two Greek words, viz., “monos” and “polus.” Monos” means” single,” and “polus” means “a seller.” A monopoly is a market structure in which there is only one supplier in a given market (industry). A monopoly market structure requires that there be a single producer of a particular commodity. For no other commodity to work as a substitute for this commodity, and for this situation to last, sufficient restrictions must be in \nplace to prevent any other firm from entering the market and beginning to sell the commodity.\nWhen there is only one firm in the market, the firm is the price maker, whereas, \nconsumers are the price takers. For instance, ELPA is one of the firms producing and supplying electric power in Ethiopia can be considered an example of a monopoly firm, (however, ELPA is state owned firm).\n4.2.1 The Characteristic Features of Pure Monopoly\nA pure monopoly exists when a single firm is the only producer of a product for which there are no close substitutes. The main characteristics of this market structure include:\nA single seller and many buyers: A pure or absolute monopoly is a one firm industry \nthat sells the product to many buyers. As a result, the monopoly firm is the only \nproducer of a specific product or the sole seller of the product, and has full control over the supply and price of the product. In this case, the firm and the industry are one and the same (i.e., the firm = the industry).\nNo close substitutes : a product produced by a monopolist has a close substitute, \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

So, the monopoly firm would not face competition from new or existing products. For example, there is no close substitute for the electric services provided by ELPA.\nPrice maker: The individual firm exercises considerable control over price because \nit is responsible for, and therefore controls, the total quantity supplied. As a result, the \nmonopolist becomes a price-maker and fixes its own price. By having a downward-sloped demand curve for its product, the monopolist can influence the market price by changing the supply of the product.\nPrice Discrimination: Under the conditions of a monopoly, price discrimination is \npossible. It implies that a monopolist can sell its product at different prices to different customers.\nRestrictions on Entry: In a monopoly, new competitors cannot freely enter the \nmarket due to some strict barriers. These barriers may be due to legal restrictions like \nlicencing or patent rights or restrictions created due to economies of scale. There are various reasons for the existence of monopolies that help the monopolists to maintain monopoly power. Some of these factors are the following.\nyAbsence of close substitutes. A firm enjoys a monopoly when it is the sole seller of its product and the product has no close substitutes.\nyEconomies of scale in production are another reason for the emergence of monopolies. A firm is said to have economies of scale if its long-term average cost is declining. Small firms do not have the capacity to do so. In such a situation, when the incumbent firm observes that new firms are entering the market, it will produce a large amount of output to minimize its unit cost of production and will charge a lower price than the new firms to deter entry.\nyOwnership of strategic or key inputs. A company may own or control the entire supply of a raw material needed to manufacture a commodity. Such firms are not willing to sell the raw materials to another firm. For example: Ambo mineral water has monopolized the natural mineral water.\nyPatent rights for products or production processes give legal monopoly rights to firms. Government policies such as those related to granting licences or imposing foreign trade restrictions (like quotas, etc.) result in limiting the number of sellers.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

MOHA and Coca Cola soft drink companies have maintained monopoly power over the supply of their products, partly due to exclusive knowledge of the ingredient chemicals required for the production of their products.\n4.2.2 The Demand and Revenue Functions of the Monopoly Firm\na. Demand\nIn the previous section, we have seen that a perfectly competitive firm is small relative to the market in which it operates and, therefore, takes the price of its output as given by market conditions and faces a demand curve that is horizontal. However, as a monopoly is the sole producer in its market, it can alter the price of its goods by adjusting the quantity it supplies to the market.\nThus, a monopoly firm faces a downward-sloping market demand curve. As a result, the \nmonopoly has to accept a lower price if it wants to sell more output. If the monopolist decides to raise the price of the product, it will reduce the quantity of supply.\nFigure 4.4 Monopolist’s Demand Curve\nFigure 4.4 shows the monopolist firm facing a downward-sloping demand curve, which implies that as the monopolist raises the price of its goods, consumers buy less of it. If the monopolist reduces its price, it will increase the quantity of output it sells. Where possible, a monopolist would prefer to charge a high price and sell a large quantity at that high price. The market demand curve makes that outcome impossible. In particular, the market demand curve describes the combinations of price and quantity that are available to a monopoly firm. The monopolist can choose any point on the downward-sloping demand curve, but it cannot choose a point off the demand curve.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Revenue Function \nThe revenues of a firm are the receipts that it obtains from selling its products. Revenues have three main categories: Total Revenue (TR), Average Revenue (AR), and Marginal Revenue (MR).\nyTotal Revenue (TR): Total revenue is the total amount of money a company receives from the sale of a given quantity of its product. It is obtained by multiplying the unit price of the commodity and the quantity of that product sold.\nTR=P \nX Q; where P = price of the product\n                                Q = quantity of the product sold.\n     From demand function P = a – bQ\n     Substituting (a – bQ) for P     TR = (a - bQ) Q     TR = aQ – b Q\n2 \nyAverage revenue (AR): is the revenue per unit of item sold.

It is the additional amount of money or revenue the monopolist firm receives by selling one more unit of the product.

Suppose you walk into a stationary to buy a pen. On the stationer’s shelve, you \nfind different type of pens. When you pick out one and buy it, what kind of market are you participating in? Discuss about this in groups of three.\nA monopolistic competition market refers to a market structure where there are \nrelatively large numbers of sellers and buyers, and there is a free entry and exit of firms producing and selling differentiated (heterogeneous) products. A seller of a differentiated product has limited monopoly power over customers who prefer his/her product to others.\nMonopolistic competition has some features of competition and some features of \nmonopoly. The market is competitive due to the existence of a large number of firms, and there is no barrier to entry or exit. Its monopoly features, however, result from differentiated products that are close substitute products. Thus, this market is more real market, and its actual market situations are somewhere in between a perfect competitive market and a monopoly market.\n4.3.1 Monopolistically competitive market characteristics\nMonopolistic competition describes a market with the following characteristics:\nProduct differentiation: each firm produces and supplies a product that is at least slightly different from those of other firms. The difference could be in style, brand name, quality, etc. Different firms produce products like pens, biscuits, soap, and include stores that sell different styles of clothing; restaurants that sell different kinds of food; and even products like beer that may be at least similar but different in terms of public perception because of advertising and brand names.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Similarly, if any firm believes that it is not worth staying in the business, it is free to exit.\nThe existence of non-price competition: due to product differentiation, in addition \nto price competition, there is also non-price competition. Non-price competition is an essential part of monopolistic competition. Non-price competitions take the form of product quality, advertising, brand name, customer service, etc. For example, a firm spends money on advertisements to reach consumers about the relatively unique characteristics of its product, thereby getting new buyers and developing brand loyalty.\n4.3.2 The Demand and Revenue Functions\n a.

What is an oligopoly market? Discuss this topic in pairs.\nAn oligopoly is a market organization in which there are few firms that produce \nidentical or closely substituted products (identical or differentiated). An oligopoly is said to exist when there is more than one seller in the market, but their number is not so large as to make the contribution of each firm negligible. Firms are, therefore, situated mutually interdependently. That is, they behave as if one firm’s actions are directly affected by those of rivals and by the actions of others. One example is the world market for crude oil. A few countries in the Middle East control much of the world’s oil reserves. Cement and sugar factories are examples of oligopoly firms in Ethiopia.\n4.4.1 Characteristics of the Oligopoly market \nAn oligopoly market describes a market with the following characteristics:\nFew dominant firms: the number of firms is small enough that each firm recognizes the \nactions of other firms, implying that firms are mutually interdependent.\nyEntry barrier: in an oligopoly market, the barrier to entry is difficult or impossible for new firms to enter the market. Barriers to entry may arise as a result of; scale of economics and large capital requirements compared to other markets, except monopoly.\nyPatents or access to technology or raw materials may exclude potential competitors.\nyProducts may be homogenous or differentiated.\nyThere is interdependence among the firms.

The three main criteria are: the number of potential buyers (demanders) and sellers (suppliers); whether the good or service is homogeneous or heterogeneous; and whether there is free entry and free exit from the market. Based on these criteria, markets are classified into the following main categories:\nTypes of market Main characteristics\n1.Perfect Competition •large number of buyers and sellers \n•homogeneous product \n•free entry/exit \n•full information transparency\n2.Monopoly •one dominant supplier \n•homogeneous product \n•restricted entry/exit \n3.Monopolistic competition •large number of buyers and sellers \n•heterogeneous product \n•free entry/exit \n4.Oligopoly •limited number of dominant suppliers\n•homogeneous/heterogeneous product\n•restricted entry/exit\nBecause a competitive firm is a price taker, its revenue is proportional to the amount of output it produces. The price of the good equals both the firm’s average revenue and its marginal revenue. A monopoly arises when a single firm owns a key resource, when the government gives a firm the exclusive right to produce a good, or when a single firm can supply the entire market at a lower cost than many firms could. Because a monopoly is the sole producer in its market, it faces a downward-sloping demand curve for its product.\nA monopolistically competitive market is characterized by three attributes: many \nfirms, differentiated products, and free entry. The product differentiation inherent in monopolistic competition leads to the use of advertising and brand names. The latter two types of imperfect markets (oligopoly and monopolistic competition) are characterized by rivalry among individual firms.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Financial intermediaries offer a number of benefits to the average consumer, such as safety, liquidity, and economies of scale involved in banking and asset management. \nIn other words, financial intermediaries mediate between the providers (with excess \nmoney) and users (with shortage of money) of financial capital.

For depositors: Financial intermediaries give safety and interest earning. Safety refers \nto the fact that the money of the depositors is free from any risk of loss. Banks also pay interest on the money saved at their banks by the depositors. These are the benefits to the depositors by financial intermediaries. \nFor the borrowers:  People borrow money from banks and other financial intermedi -\naries are known as investors.

They provide a variety of assets to savers as well as various forms in which the investors can raise funds and thereby decouple the acts of saving and investment. The savers and investors are constrained not by their individual abilities, but by the economy’s ability, to invest and save respectively. The financial markets, thus, contribute to economic development to the extent that the latter depends on the rates of savings and investment.\nThe financial markets have two major components:\nA .

But, they only left a legacy of inefficiency, corruption, and \nmillions of dollars of wasted subsidies. Thus, providing loans to the poor with no collateral was an issue for so many years until Mohammed Yunus (Bangladeshi Economist born in 1940) came with a noble winning idea of microfinancing and microcredit, resulting in the establishment of the Grameen Bank. \nMuhammad Yunus started making small loans to local poor villagers with no collateral \nand could not get loans from the formal traditional banks. He believed that his poor clients would make profits and be able to pay back the loans reliably. \nToday microfinance institutions serve millions of poor people in different countries in the world. They provide small/micro loans without collateral, collecting deposits, and, increasingly, selling insurance, all to customers who had been written off by commercial banks as being unprofitable. Advocates see the changes as a revolution in thinking about poverty reduction and social change, and not just a banking movement. (Armendáriz & Morduch, 2010 ).\n 5.5.1 Microfinance and Microcredit\nMicrofinance institutions (MFIs): are financial institutions that give access to financial services such as savings, credit, insurance and money transfer to people that otherwise would remain un-served by the traditional banking system that asks for collaterals. What makes microfinance (-ing) different from other anti-poverty tools is the idea that it improves the living conditions of the poor through their own efforts.

For them the main constraint is a small investment in \nworking capital, and microcredit allows overcoming this obstacle. The purpose of these organizations is the provision of financial services to those who would otherwise be excluded from the formal financial system.\nA microcredit:  is a small credit given to a client by a microfinance institution. \nMicrocredit is offered, often without collateral,  to an individual through group lending \nmechanism. Group lending is a mechanism that allows a number of individuals to \nobtain a loan through a group scheme. The group is taken as collateral in this case. The incentive to repay is based on peer pressure; if one person in the group defaults, the other group members must make up the payment amount. \nMicrocredit has been proven an effective tool against poverty, enabling those without \naccess to the formal financial system to borrow the small amount of funds they need and start or develop small businesses.\nMicro-entrepreneurs, or economically active poor, are business people who through \nmicrofinance take advantage of economic opportunities that otherwise would remain \nunserved due to financial constraints . \nMicrofinance institutions (MFIs) give not only microcredit, however, but also other financial services like saving service, insurance service and money transfer service that improve the well-being of the poor and helps poor people to stabilize income and to protect against risks. \n5.5.2 Clients of Microfinance\nThe clients of microfinance are the “economically active poor” or low-income persons that do not have access to formal financial institutions. This “economically active poor” clients of microfinances must have economic opportunities and entrepreneurial skills as the money they receive must not be used for consumption but for productive purposes.  The “poorest of the poor”, or “the destitute”, are generally excluded from the circle of microfinance and targeted by other development programs, because they don’t have economic opportunities or entrepreneurial skills. \nGroup lending mechanism has been proven to be a good option for lending the money \nto the economically active poor. In this mechanism, each member of the group is guarantee/collateral for the other. The effectiveness and sustainability of group lending mechanism depends on the strength of social ties and the influence of peer pressure in the society. \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Automated teller Machines (ATMs) will also let you transfer funds between your accounts or to other accounts, make deposits, bill payments and also exchange currencies. ATMs allow customers to complete basic transactions without the aid of a branch representative or a teller.  Service fees are commonly charged for cash withdrawals when using ATMs. \nII .

Debit Card Purchases\nDebit card purchases are similar to credit card transactions with some differences. You can make debit card purchases in person, online or over the phone. In debit card purchase, the money is taken directly out of your linked account and you can’t spend more than you have. \nWhen using a debit card to make a purchase you are paying for the item then and \nthere, drawing on funds in your bank account. When you use a credit card, however, you’re essentially borrowing money from the card company for the item. It pays the merchant, and then bills you for the amount.

Depending on their income, Ethiopians save some amount of money in “iqqubs” per week. This ranges from 100 birr to 10, 000 birr based on the capability of the members in that “Iqqub”. While most employees do this on a monthly basis, business people also save on either a weekly or even daily basis. The Iqub money is used mostly in social occasions such as weddings, funerals, sickness, and also to finish \nsome unfinished activities like building a house, etc. and it circulates among members regularly until all the members get their part of the saving. (Lakew & Azadi, 2020).\nIddir on the other hand is mostly for funeral and associated services. Membership is \nmostly based on locality and the contributions are monthly. It is based on the wisdom that, death to the family member is sure to come one day. Until that, the member will contribute some amount of money every month in “iddirs”. The Iddirs will give the member some amount of money so that he will undertake the necessaries. \nThese will be discussed briefly in the following sub-sections:\n1.The “iqqub”- or Saving club\nMembership in the “iqqub” is based on pre-established social ties. It consists of \nhomogeneous groups: people from the same work place , same ethnic background, \nsame trade or business activity, schooling background or neighborhood.

(AREDO, 1993)\nPeople prefer “iqqub” to the formal financial sector because of the following reasons \nas discussed by (AREDO, 1993):\n•\tThe strengthening of the ties of solidarity and friendship in the group,\n•\tThe forced savings of a contractual nature,\n•\tThe flexibility and adaptability of the “iqqub” to various situations and needs,\n•\tThe low risk of default,\n•\tThe low or practically non-existent costs of administration and transactions,\n•\tThe absence of minimum investment threshold,\n•\tTendency to gamble and the consequent attraction which the lottery holds for them. \n2.The “iddir”\n“Iddir” is an indigenous financial and social institution that almost exists everywhere \nthroughout Ethiopia.   “ Iddir” provides a wide range of services including financial \nand material assistance and consolations to a member in the event of difficulties as well as entertainment as the case may be. \nThe services provided by “iddirs” include funeral expenses, financial assistance to \nfamilies of the deceased and, in some cases, coverage of other risks such as medical \nexpenses, losses due to fire or theft, etc . Almost every “iddir” has its own by-laws \nspecifying the duties and responsibilities of members, procedures and functions of the officials.\nSocial ties are very important in “iddirs” also like the case of “iqqub”. A member is \nrequired to attend meetings, be present at funeral ceremonies, visit the sick, etc.  The \nby-laws of “iddirs” are observed because of powerful social sanctions and fines of \ndeviant behaviors among members of the “ iddirs”.\nMembers’ contributions vary from one “iddir” to another. Most of the common fund is deposited in the bank account purposely opened for the “ iddir” while only a small \nsum of money is kept with the officials for emergency purposes.

An answer to the question of why some countries are rich and others are poor can only be given by assessing their economic growth. The changes we realize in the types of economic activities undertaken and also the methods used in their performances are best explained by the changes in the level of the economy, i.e., economic growth. The capability that a country has to alleviate poverty and provide its citizens with a reasonable and higher standard of living depends, to a large extent, on how rapidly its economy grows. The majority of modern literature in economics is dedicated to an understanding of the processes of economic growth. \nIn this unit of grade 10\nth economics text book, we will discuss “macroeconomic \nvariables, definition and measurement of economic growth, sources of economic \ngrowth: economic factors and non-economic factors, why growth varies across economies, classification of countries by income levels: Low income, middle income and upper income,   measurement of productivity, the effect of productivity on economic growth, the weaknesses of using  GDP/GDP Per Capita, and the business cycle: its definition and phases”. \nThus, students should be thinking about their country’s economic status throughout this \nunit.

Economics is a social science that deals with making decisions of getting the best out of the limited resources that we have. If these decisions are made at individual decision makers level, the analysis will be categorized under microeconomics. If on the other hand, \nthese decisions are made at a country level, and the analysis will be categorized under macroeconomics.\nIndividual decision-making units in economics include individual consumer (buyer) \nand individual producer (seller) in the economy. Consumers try to maximize their satisfaction from the goods and services they consume. Producers try to maximize their profit from selling the goods and services. Thus, microeconomics gives a good \nanalysis of how much the consumer should consume (buy) with the available budget. Similarly, the producer decides on the quantity of input used in the production process to maximize profit from the goods and services produced with the limited factors of production available. This is known in economics as optimization. \nNations make decisions through their governments or leaders. The endowments of \ncountries such as land, forest, water, population, machineries, capital, etc. are limited. If not used economically, they will be wasted without attaining the macroeconomic goals of: increased economic growth, reduced unemployment, stable price, increased balance of payment, etc. Thus, macroeconomics is the best tool available in making\nthe decision of giving priorities in production and consumption at country level so that we attain the macroeconomic goals mentioned above. These macroeconomic decisions are made through government macroeconomic policies.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

On the other hand, the major macroeconomic \ngoals pursued by governments of countries are; improved current account balance; \nstable prices; increased economic growth; and reduced unemployment.   \nI .  Current Account Balance: countries sell their goods and services to other \ncountries (export) and also, they buy goods and services from other countries \n(import). Thus, current account balance is the difference between the dollar value of goods a country exports and the dollar value of goods a country imports. \n•\tTherefore, current account or trade balance = Exports (X) – Imports (M).\nThere will be two scenarios:\nScenario 1: If the value of exports (X) is greater than the value of imports (M), \nthere is a trade surplus. This is a desirable outcome. The country is benefitting from the trade.  This is true for developed countries exporting expensive man-ufactured commodities.Scenario 2: If the value of exports (X) is less than the value of imports (M), there is a trade deficit. This is not a desirable outcome. The country is now losing from the trade. Least developed countries face this scenario since they export cheap primary agricultural commodities. \nII .  Inflation: is an increase in the overall price level of goods and services over a \ncertain period of time. The rise in the general level of prices, often expressed as a percentage, indicates that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods. This implies that, when there is inflation, there will be a fall in purchasing power of currencies over time. High inflation is not desirable in an economy. This would mean that policymakers try and keep inflation low. \nThere are two types (causes) of inflation;\n⇒\tCost-push inflation: when the costs of production is high produc-ers increase price to be profitable; and \n⇒\tDemand-pull inflation: when growing demand (being able to pay higher prices) for goods that firms produce, allowing firms to even increase prices to gain more profit.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

In richer countries’ \n(such as; the United States, Japan, or Germany) average income, is more than ten times the average income of poor countries (such as India, Indonesia, or Nigeria). These large differences in income lead to large differences in the quality of life. People in richer countries have better nutrition, safer housing, better healthcare, and longer \nlife expectancy  as well as more automobiles, more telephones, and more televisions .\nIn different countries, economic growth rates are substantially different. Recently, some East Asian countries, such as Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, have achieved economic growth of about seven percent (7%) per year. At this rate, their average income doubles every ten (10) years. Even more recently, China has enjoyed an even higher rate of growth—about twelve percent (12%) per year. A country experiencing \nsuch rapid growth can, in one generation, go from being among the poorest in the world to being among the richest .\n6.3.1 Productivity as cause for differences in living standards among \ncountries\nExplaining the large variation in living standards around the world is in one sense very easy. As we will see, the explanation can be summarized in a single word—productivity. But in another sense, the international variation is deeply puzzling. To explain why incomes are so much higher in some countries than in others, we must look at the many factors that determine a nation’s productivity.\nWhy productivity is so important: Productivity’s key role in determining living \nstandards is as true for nations as it is for stranded sailors (Robinson Crusoe).

GDP can measure these two things simultaneously \nbecause, for the economy as a whole, they must be equal. Put simply, an economy’s income is the economy’s output. \nA nation can enjoy a high standard of living only if it can produce a large quantity \nof goods and services. Americans live better than Nigerians because American workers are more productive than Nigerian workers. The Japanese have enjoyed more rapid growth in living standards than Argentineans because Japanese workers have experienced more rapid growth in productivity.\nHow productivity is determined: Crusoe (in Robinson Crusoe) will be better at \ncatching fish (he will be more productive), for instance, if he has more fishing poles, \nif he has been trained in the best fishing techniques , if his island has a plentiful fish \nsupply, or if he invents a better fishing lure. Each of these determinants of Crusoe’s \nproductivity—which we can call physical capital, human capital, natural resources, \nand technological knowledge —has a counterpart in more complex and realistic \neconomies. Let’s consider each factor in turn.\nI .  Physical capital Per worker- Workers are more productive if they have tools \nwith which to work . Physical capital per worker is the amount of tools and \nmachineries available for each worker to work with.\nII .  Human Capital Per Worker- A second determinant of productivity is human \ncapital. Human capital is the economist’s term for the knowledge and skills that workers acquire through education, training, and experience . Human \ncapital includes the skills accumulated in early childhood programs, grade school, high school, college, and on-the-job training for adults in the labor force.  Producing human capital requires inputs in the form of teachers, \nlibraries, and student time. \nIII .  Natural Resources Per worker- A third determinant of productivity is natural \nresource. Natural resources are inputs into production that are provided by nature, such as land, rivers, and mineral deposits.  Differences in natural resources are responsible for some of the differences in standards of living around the world. The historical success of the United States  was driven \nin part by the large supply of land well suited for agriculture . Today, some \ncountries in the Middle East, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, are rich \nsimply because they happen to be on top of some of the largest pools of \noil in the world.

Japan, for instance, is one of the richest countries in the world, despite having few natural resources. International trade makes Japan’s success possible. Japan imports many of the natural resources it needs, such as oil, and exports its manufactured goods to economies rich in natural resources.\nIV .  Technological Knowledge- A fourth determinant of productivity is \ntechnological knowledge—the understanding of the best ways to produce goods and services. A hundred years ago, most Americans worked on farms because farm technology required a high input of labor to feed the entire population. Today, thanks to advances in farming technology, a small fraction of the population can produce enough food to feed the entire country. This \ntechnological change made labor available to produce other goods and services.\n6.3.2 Characteristics of Economic Growth\nSimon Kuznets, a renowned Economist and the father of national income accounting, identified five major characteristics of modern economic growth: \na)High rates of increase in per capita income: Modern economic growth \nessentially means high rates of growth of per capita income over a fairly long period of time. \nb)High rates of increase in factor productivity : Modern economic growth also \nrequires increase in the productivity of all the factors of production. \nc)High rates of structural transformation: Modern economic growth requires \na shift in the economic activities from less productive (agricultural) to more productive (industrial) areas. Growth of the entrepreneurial class, which has the desire and capacity to undertake new economic activities, is an essential prerequisite for structural transformation to take place. \nd)Increase in the rates of saving and investment : Economic growth takes place \nwhen the domestic saving and investment rates rise. The establishment and expansion of modern financial services is necessary for mobilizing domestic resources.\ne)Increasing application of modern scientific knowledge in the production process:Application of scientific knowledge in the production process increases the effi-ciency of resource utilization and besides provides substitutes for the resources that are scarce. \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Thus, GDP per person tells us the income and expenditure of the average person in the economy. Because most people would prefer to receive higher income and enjoy higher expenditure, GDP per person seems a natural measure of the economic well-being of the average individual. But the following are the limitations of GDP as a measure of economic performance of a nation;\nGDP , however, is not a perfect measure of well-being:  Some things that contribute \nto a good life are left out of GDP. One is leisure. Suppose, for instance, that everyone \nin the economy suddenly started working every day of the week, rather than enjoying \nleisure on weekends. More goods and services would be produced, and GDP would rise. Yet despite the increase in GDP, we should not conclude that everyone would be better off. The loss from reduced leisure would offset the gain from producing and \nconsuming a greater quantity of goods and services.\nBecause GDP uses market prices to value goods and services, it excludes the value \nof almost all activity that takes place outside markets.  In particular, GDP omits the \nvalue of goods and services produced at home.  When a chef prepares a delicious meal \nand sells it at his restaurant, the value of that meal is part of GDP. But if the chef prepares the same meal for his family, the value he has added to the raw ingredients is left out of GDP. Similarly, child care provided in day-care centers is part of GDP , \nwhereas child care by parents at home is not. Volunteer work also contributes to the well-being of those in society , but GDP does not reflect these contributions.\nAnother thing that GDP excludes is the quality of the environment.

Firms could then produce goods \nand services without considering the pollution they create, and GDP might rise. Yet well-being would most likely fall. The deterioration in the quality of air and water would more than offset the gains from greater production.\nGDP also says nothing about the distribution of income. A society in which 100 people \nhave annual incomes of $50,000 has GDP of $5 million and, not surprisingly, GDP per person of $50,000. So does a society in which 10 people earn $500,000 and 90 suffer with nothing at all. Few people would look at those two situations and call them equivalent. GDP per person tells us what happens to the average person, but behind the average lies a large variety of personal experiences.

Their \ntransactions are valuable to the society’s well-being but since they are illegal, they will not be counted in the GDP. \n•\tIn the end, we can conclude that GDP is a good measure of economic wellbeing for most—but not all—purposes.

On the other hand, the major macroeconomic goals pursued by governments of countries are; improved current account balance; stable prices; increased economic growth; and reduced unemployment.  \n Economic growth is when Real Gross Domestic Product (RGDP) increases in the \nshort run, whereas it refers to a sustained increase in per capita income and associated structural changes in the economy, in the long run. \nEconomic growth comes when resources are recreated, reorganized and reallocated in \na more efficient manner. Technological improvement brings economic growth since it increases productivity of factors of production.\nThe United Nations, as of 2010, categorize a group of countries with low income, low \nhuman capital, and high economic vulnerability as the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). This classification includes 49 countries of the world; 33 in Africa, 15 in Asia, plus Haiti. \nGDP is not a perfect measure of well-being because it excludes: the well-being that \none gets from leisure; it excludes the value of almost all activity that takes place outside markets; it  also excludes the quality of the environment/or its deterioration; it also excludes issues about the distribution of income; it also excludes Black market transactions. \nThe term business cycle is somewhat misleading because it suggests that economic \nfluctuations follow a regular, predictable pattern.

From the Monarchy up to 1974, the economy was primarily agricultural. The economy was based on a feudal system under which land ownership was highly inequitable with major portions of farmland being in the hands of wealthy landlords and the very few industries that existed were owned by foreigners.\nDuring the Military Regime (1974 – 1991), the economy shifted to a command \neconomy where socialist principles and ideologies ruled. Substantial land reforms were introduced in the agricultural, industrial and financial sectors. The government owned all the large-scale manufacturing industries, banks and insurance companies. In spite of all these measures, the regime failed to solve Ethiopia’s multifaceted problems. That ended when on May 28th, 1991, the EPRDF marched into Addis Ababa and seized power.\nAfter the EPRDF assumed power in 1991, the government followed a market-oriented \neconomy. It supported economic reform based on privatization of state enterprises, promotion of agricultural exports and deregulation through a move towards free market of the economy. The move facilitated significant sectoral growth performances.\nWith this in mind, this unit the following points will be discussed, “C omponents of \nMacro-economy (GDP); Overview of the main sectors of Ethiopian economy: The \nAgriculture sector, Role of the agricultural sector, Structure of the Agricultural Sector; Industry: The role of the industrial sector; Service: The role of the service sector, Components of the service sector; Agriculture versus industrial development, Arguments of industrial sector verses the rest of the economic sectors ”.    \nUnit ObjectivesBy the end of this unit, students will be able to;\n6Examine the macroeconomic performance of Ethiopia.\n6Analyze the role and performance of each sector in economic growth.\n6Write a brief report on Ethiopian Economy\n6Compute GDP, NGDP, RGDP and GDP deflatorThe Ethiopian Economy Unit\n7\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

At any moment, the Soressa family may be having lunch at Kaku Mame Restaurant; Haile Motors may be building a \ncar factory; the Ethiopian National Defense Force may be procuring Drones; and Ethiopian Airlines may be buying an airplane from Boeing. GDP includes all of these various forms of spending on domestically produced goods and services. \nTo understand how the economy is using its scarce resources, economists study \nthe composition of GDP among various types of spending. To do this, GDP (which we denote as Y) is divided into four components: consumption (C), investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX): \nY = C + I + G + NX, Where NX =Export(X)-Import(I).\nThis equation is an identity—an equation that must be true because of how the variables in the equation are defined. In this case, because each birr of expenditure included in GDP is placed into one of the four components of GDP, the total of the four components must be equal to GDP. Let’s look at each of these four components more closely.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Goods- include household spending on durable goods, \nsuch as automobiles and appliances,  and nondurable goods, such as food and clothing . \nServices- include such intangible items as haircuts and medical care. Household \nspending on education  is also included in consumption of services (although one \nmight argue that it would fit better in the next component).\nii.Investment\nInvestment is the purchase of goods that will be used in the future to produce more \ngoods and services. It is the sum of purchases of capital equipment, inventories, \nand structures. Investment in structures includes expenditure on new housing. By \nconvention, the purchase of a new house is the one form of household spending \ncategorized as investment rather than consumption. \nThe treatment of inventory accumulation is noteworthy. When Dell produces a \ncomputer and adds it to its inventory instead of selling it, Dell is assumed to have “purchased” the computer for itself. That is, the national income accountants treat the computer as part of Dell’s investment spending. (If Dell later sells the computer out of inventory, Dell’s inventory investment will then be negative, offsetting the positive expenditure of the buyer.) Inventories are treated this way because one aim of GDP is to measure the value of the economy’s production, and goods added to inventory are part of that period’s production.\nNotice that GDP accounting uses the word investment differently from how you might \nhear the term in everyday conversation. When you hear the word investment, you might think of financial investments, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds . By \ncontrast, because GDP measures expenditure on goods and services, here the word investment means purchases of goods (such as capital equipment, structures, and \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

It includes the salaries of government workers as well as \nexpenditures on public works. \nThe meaning of government purchases requires a bit of clarification. When the \ngovernment pays the salary of an Army general or a schoolteacher, that salary is part of government purchases. But when the government pays a Social Security benefit\nto a person who is elderly or an unemployment insurance benefit  to a worker who \nwas recently laid off, the story is very different: These are called transfer payments\nbecause they are not made in exchange for a currently produced good or service. Transfer payments alter household income, but they do not reflect the economy’s production. (From a macroeconomic standpoint, transfer payments are like negative taxes.) Because GDP is intended to measure income from, and expenditure on, the production of goods and services, transfer payments are not counted as part of \ngovernment purchases.\niv.Net Exports\nNet exports equal the value of foreign purchases of domestically produced goods (value of exports) minus the value of domestic purchases of foreign goods (value of \nimports). A domestic firm’s sale to a buyer in another country, such as Haile Motors’s sale of a car to Kenyans, increases net exports. \nThe net in net exports refers to the fact that value of imports is subtracted from \nthe value of exports. This subtraction is made because other components of GDP \ninclude imports of goods and services. For example, suppose that a household buys a Birr 300,000 car from Toyota, the Japanese carmaker. That transaction increases consumption by Birr 300,000 because car purchases are part of consumer spending. It also reduces net exports by Birr 300,000 because the car is an import. In other words, net exports include goods and services produced abroad (with a minus sign) because these goods and services are included in consumption, investment, and government purchases (with a plus sign). Thus, when a domestic household, firm, or government buys a good or service from abroad, the purchase reduces net exports, but because it also raises consumption, investment, or government purchases, it does not affect GDP.\nNet Exports = Total Export (E) - Total Import (M)\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

In particular, they want a measure of the total quantity of goods and \nservices the economy is producing that is not affected by changes in the prices of \nthose goods and services.\nTo do this, economists use a measure called real GDP. Real GDP answers a hypothetical \nquestion: What would be the value of the goods and services produced this year if we \nvalued these goods and services at the prices that prevailed in some specific year in \nthe past? \nyBy evaluating current production using prices that are fixed at past levels, \nreal GDP shows how the economy’s overall production of goods and services changes over time.\nTo obtain a measure of the amount produced that is not affected by changes in prices, \nwe use real GDP, which is the production of goods and services valued at constant \nprices. We calculate real GDP by;\n1.First designating one year as a base year\n2.Then use the prices of goods and services in the base year to compute the \nvalue of goods and services in all the years . \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

We can then use \nthe prices of Kitfo and Chumbo in 2010 to compute the value of goods and services \nproduced in 2010, 2011, and 2012. Table 2 shows these calculations. To compute real GDP for 2010, we use the prices of Kitfo and Chumbo in 2010 (the base year) and \nthe quantities of Kitfo and Chumbo produced in 2010. (Thus, for the base year, real GDP always equals nominal GDP.) To compute real GDP for 2011, we use the prices of Kitfo and Chumbo in 2010 (the base year) and the quantities of Kitfo and Chumbo\nproduced in 2011. Similarly, to compute real GDP for 2012, we use the prices in 2010 and the quantities in 2012. When we find that real GDP has risen from Birr 200 in 2010 to Birr 350 in 2011 and then to Birr 500 in 2012, we know that the increase is attributable to an increase in the quantities produced because the prices are being held fixed at base-year levels.\nTo sum up: Nominal GDP uses current prices to place a value on the economy’s \nproduction of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to place a value on the economy’s production of goods and services. Because real GDP is not affected by changes in prices, changes in real GDP reflect only changes in the amounts being produced. Thus, real GDP is a measure of the economy’s production of goods and services. (Mankiw, 2012).\nOur goal in computing GDP is to gauge how well the overall economy is performing.\nBecause real GDP measures the economy’s production of goods and services, it reflects \nthe economy’s ability to satisfy people’s needs and desires. Thus, real GDP is a better \ngauge of economic well-being than is nominal GDP . When economists talk about the economy’s GDP, they usually mean real GDP rather than nominal GDP. And when they talk about growth in the economy, they measure that growth as the percentage change in real GDP from one period to another.\n7.2.1 The GDP Deflator\nNominal GDP reflects both the quantities  of goods and services the economy is \nproducing and the prices of those goods and services. By contrast, by holding prices constant at base-year levels, real GDP reflects only the quantities produced. From these two statistics, we can compute a third, called the GDP deflator, which reflects \nonly the prices of goods and services.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

The GDP deflator for subsequent years measures the change in nominal GDP from the base year that cannot be attributable to a change in real GDP.\nThe GDP deflator measures the current level of prices relative to the level of prices \nin the base year. To see why this is true, consider a couple of simple examples. First, imagine that the quantities produced in the economy rise over time but prices remain the same. In this case, both nominal and real GDP rise together, so the GDP deflator is constant. Now suppose, instead, that prices rise over time but the quantities produced stay the same. In this second case, nominal GDP rises but real GDP remains the same, so the GDP deflator rises as well. Notice that, in both cases, the GDP deflator reflects what’s happening to prices, not quantities.\nLet’s now return to our numerical example in Table 7. 2. The GDP deflator is computed \nat the bottom of the table. For year 2010, nominal GDP is Birr 200, and real GDP is Birr 200, so the GDP deflator is 100. (The deflator is always 100 in the base year.) For the year 2011, nominal GDP is Birr 600, and real GDP is Birr 350, so the GDP deflator is 171.\nEconomists use the term inflation to describe a situation in which the economy’ s overall \nprice level is rising.  The inflation rate is the percentage change in some measure of \nthe price level from one period to the next. Using the GDP deflator, the inflation rate \nbetween two consecutive years is computed as follows:\nInflation rate in year 2 = 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝐺𝐺𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑌𝑌𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 2− 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝐺𝐺𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑌𝑌𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 1\n𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝐺𝐺𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑌𝑌𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 1𝑥𝑥100\nBecause the GDP deflator rose in year 2011 from 100 to 171, the inflation rate is       100 × (171 – 100)/100, or 71 percent. In 2012, the GDP deflator rose to 240 from 171 the previous year, so the inflation rate is 100 × (240 – 171)/171, or 40 percent.\nThe GDP deflator is one measure that economists use to monitor the average level of \nprices in the economy and thus the rate of inflation. The GDP deflator gets its name because it can be used to take inflation out of nominal GDP—that is, to “deflate” nominal GDP for the rise that is due to increases in prices.

Hence its \nperformance determines the economic well-being of the people. Also, many other economic activities, including transportation and manufacturing, rely heavily on the agricultural sector.\nMain Features of the Agricultural Sector: Agriculture contributes about 45% of the \noverall GDP of the country; generates more than 80% of export earnings; employs \nabout 85% of the population; and supplies about 70% of raw materials to the secondary activities (Central Statistics Office, 2006). The agricultural sector produces both crops and livestock. The crops produced include food crops, cash crops, fruits, and vegetables. It constitutes the greatest share of the country’s GDP and export earnings when compared to the livestock production.

It is a source of food and raw materials\nOne of the main roles of agriculture in the Ethiopian economy is being the source of food and raw materials. For example, agriculture supplies the country with food grains, dairy and meat products. A productive agricultural sector provides relatively abundant food and raw materials to the population.\nBackward linkages:  an efficient/productive agricultural sector supplies food and raw \nmaterial to the industrial sector and its labor force. In turn, it has to be supplied with \nmodern inputs and technologies to cope with responding to the growing demand of the non-farming and farming population. Without such support, the agriculture sector appears weak and non-supportive. It may even risk its own population facing food insecurity.\nFurthermore, productivity in the agricultural sector improves the level of income \nreceived by rural people. Increased income of rural people is believed to generate increased demand for manufactured goods from the industrial sector.\nForward linkages: productivity in the agricultural sector can promote the following \nforward linkages. First, it reduces the cost of living in the industry- based/urban areas which, in turn, reduces the pressure on wages and makes industrial profit higher. Second, increasing the provision of raw materials reduces the cost of raw materials and makes industrial profits higher. These two factors can contribute significantly to increasing industrial savings and investment that leads to the promotion of the sector.\nII . It is a source of capital\nAlthough the agricultural sector provides meager surpluses of savings and taxes to support investment, the transference of surplus from the agricultural sector to other sectors is made through the following three modalities:\n•\ttax;\n•\tdefining the terms of trade to protect domestic agriculture by imposing price controls on agricultural products, and\n•\tCompulsory delivery of agriculture commodities at very fixed prices.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

One is that agriculture does not require large amounts of capital for its expansion. The other view is that the investment requirements for agricultural transformation are so large that there may be a need for a net flow of capital from non-agriculture to agriculture.\nThe Derg regime removed a great deal of surplus from the agricultural sector to supply \nboth the urban consumers and its huge army with cheap foodstuffs. However, this surplus was used ineffectively. This indicates that the potential of the agricultural sector to produce surplus that could be transferable to the other sectors could be high.\nIII . It contributes to Gross Domestic Product\nOver the last four decades, the share of agriculture and allied sectors (fisheries and forestry) to the national GDP has been declining. The percentage share declined from 76 percent in the early 1960s to 45 percent in 2003/04. Consequently, it has been the major source of fluctuations in the Ethiopian economy.\nIV . It contributes to employment\nMore than 80% of the Ethiopian populations earn their livelihood from agriculture (crop cultivation and livestock rearing activities). High population growth and low urbanization have been an increasing major challenge to this sector that it could not absorb the growing surplus labor force. Neglect or less attention to urbanization and non-farm sector development has put the farm sector under a growing pressure. Nevertheless, it supports a large percentage of the labor force.\nIn the face of the increasing scarcity of other resources, particularly agricultural land, \nmeasures should be taken to improve labor productivity in the agriculture sector.\n Structure of the Agricultural Sector\ni.Farming Systems in Ethiopia\nThe agricultural sector of Ethiopia is composed of the crop-production, livestock, \nforestry, and fishery sub-sectors. About 65% of the sector’s GDP comes from crop-production, while animal husbandry contributes 25%. The remaining 10% is generated from the allied sectors, forestry, fishing and others.\nThe national 2001/2002 Sample Agricultural Figures provides some data on the major \nagricultural production system. The report has identified three categories of farms. \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

The pastoral/nomadic system, andc. The modern commercial farming system.\na. The small holder farming system\nIt is the most important or dominant system. It accounts for more than 90 percent \nof the agricultural production and for about 95 percent of the total area under crop production. It is characterized by mixed farming.\nThe total numbers of households in this category were estimated to be about 10.58 \nmillion heads. The average household size stood at around 5 members per household. Over 86 percent of this community cultivates farmlands with areas less than 2 hectare each. \nb. The Pastoral Farming System\nAbout 40% of Ethiopia’s land area is in the arid and semi-arid zones and is located in the lowlands, below 1,500 m. There rain-fed crop production is not possible because of low-level erratic rainfall, and people rely more on livestock for subsistence. The lowlands are home to about 20% of Ethiopia’s cattle, 25% of the sheep, and 73% of the goats, plus about one million camels. These animals support some 5.5 million people.\nIn addition to feeding this population, the livestock in the range lands account for a \nmajor portion of the country’s exports of live animals, in particular of cattle. Surplus sheep and goats sourced from the rangelands represent about 19% of the domestic supply.\nEthiopia’s range lands are also important for wildlife. The main areas of wildlife \nconcentration are in the southwestern part of the country, particularly in the Omo River basin and the Gambella region. In these areas, which have a high rainfall and fertile soils, tsetse infestation has greatly suppressed agricultural and pastoral activities. Although less abundant, wildlife also exists in the eastern part of the country, particularly in the Awash Valley and in the southern rangelands. The conservation and development of these resources are carried out through the development of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and reserves. In addition, 14 controlled areas have been established, of which the largest is the Borena controlled hunting area.\nThere is not much documented information about this system of farming.

Some studies have been undertaken about the pastoralists roaming in the Awash Valley, in connection the with development of medium-to large-scale irrigation schemes there.\nLivestock production is much greater than crop production in the pastoral nomadic \nsystem. General and empirical observations suggest that this system is characterized by chronic food shortages. Thus, agricultural products and productivity are extremely low. With the possible exception of livestock vaccination, there is virtually nothing that the government (or any other, non- governmental organization) has provided for long in terms of assistance or support to the pastoral-nomadic system. However, these days, the sub-sector has been the focus of serious concern through the expansion of extension service.\nc. The Commercial Farming System\nCommercial farming system was officially introduced during the third five-year plan(1968 – 73) of the Imperial Government of Ethiopia. Among the strategies envisaged to modernize agriculture and increase marketable surplus, the plan stated that avail -\nable government land would be utilized for the establishment of large commercial farms. As a result, many entrepreneurs rented and developed commercial farms in the \nAwash Valley, the Rift Valley and other areas . After the 1974 revolution, all these farms \nwere confiscated by the government. Additional government lands in many parts of the country were also developed into large-scale state farms. These were organized into enterprises which in turn were grouped under corporations, according to their locations and output specialization. A separate ministry, the Ministry of State Farms Development was set up to manage and expand state farms. Also, another separate ministry, the Ministry of Coffee and Tea Development, was established.\nThe state farm enterprise introduced intensive farming and extensive mechanized \nagriculture. The former was based on   irrigation, while the latter was marked by rain-fed agriculture, with or without the use of fertilizers and other chemicals. It is based on bringing unused land, into cultivation a predominant feature of modern agriculture in Ethiopia prior to 1974. \nState farms have been the most pampered of all production systems in Ethiopia. \nThere had been no limit for these farms in terms of receiving land, agricultural inputs, credits, price incentives and marketing facilities. Despite all these advantages, they were unproductive and inefficient. The major characteristics of many of them were \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

In fact, most of the state farms were run on government financial resources.\nThis system, comprising about 5% of the total cropland area, together with                            \nco- operatives, accounted for less than 10% of total agricultural production.\nThe efficiency of state farms is extremely low, relative to the high expenditure made in \nestablishing and operating them. The major crops grown in these farms include cotton, coffee, tea, sugarcane, fruits and vegetables.\nThe size and role of state farms declined after 1992 when the new government granted \nsome of the state farms to nearby farmers and investors. At present, there are only 13 state farms. They produce mainly wheat, maize, cotton, coffee, and tea on 156,040 hectares of land.\nUnder the current economic policy attempted have been made establish commercial \nfarms. Out of the total investment permits issued between 1992/93 and 1997/98, 1148 or 26.8% of them were in agriculture. However, only 508 projects became operational.\nWith the advent of market economy, the Federal Government has recognized the \ndecisive role that private capital can play in the expansion and development of large-scale modern farming in order to enhance the supply of food and raw materials and to create employment opportunities. As a result, the role of state farms is expected to fall significantly. The state may operate those state farms that are strategic to the economy, jointly with domestic or foreign private capital. In order to encourage domestic and foreign private capital, without any capital limitation, the government is committed to creating an enabling environment.\nĂActivity 7.3\n1.Discuss with your desk mate the types/structure of agriculture are practiced \nin your area\n2.List out the advantages that the society can get from the agricultural sector\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

This could be due to the short history of industrialization in the country. Its growth was modest, not exceeding 6.7 percent for the last four decades except during the years from 1997/98 to 2009/2010. (Belayneh, Weldeselassie, Legesse, Tasew, Denu, & Bansal, 2011).\nThe industrial sector is dominated by three sub-sectors: manufacturing (38%), \nconstruction (25%), and electric and water supply (18%). The remaining sub- sectors, electricity, mining and quarrying, etc., constitute the remaining 19%.\nMain Features of the Industrial Sector:\n•\tThe sector contributes about 13% of GDP and 9.5% of employment.\n•\tThere are about 130 state-owned and 7,000 private manufacturing industries of \nall sizes, mainly engaged in the production of consumer goods. Main products of these manufacturing industries include:\notextiles, foodstuffs, tobacco, beverages, cement, leather and leather products, wood, metallic and non-metallic products, paper, plastic, tiles, clothing/apparel, canned and frozen meat, sugar and molasses, oil cakes and petroleum products.\n•\tThe growth performance of the industrial sector saw an appreciable improvement in recent years, compared to the average growth rate of 6.7% over the 10 years 2001/02 -2009/10.\nLooking at the growth performance of each sub-sector, the construction sector registered the highest growth rate between 2002 - 2010.

During the years 1991/92 - 1997/98, large- and medium-scale manufacturing contributed 38.4% of the gross value of industrial production, while small-scale manufacturing and handcrafts contributed around 18.7%. The contributions of mining, quarrying, and electricity-supply activities were 3.9%, 15.8%, and 23.2%, respectively. From this we can conclude that the manufacturing \nsub-sector dominated the Ethiopian industrial sector , providing more than 57% of the \nsectoral output.\nSince the manufacturing sub-sector is the most dominant and dynamic component of \nthe industrial sector, and also due to availability of time series data, we will concentrate on this sub-sector as we analyze the contribution of the industrial sector to the national economy.\ni.Out Put Contribution\nAccording to ISIC, the manufacturing sector is characterized by the physical or chemical transformation of materials or components into new products, whether the work is performed by power-driven machines or by hand, and whether it is done in a factory or in the worker’s home.\nFood and beverages accounted for about 48% of the gross value of output of \nmanufacturing establishments in 2007/08, followed by non-metal (17%) and chemicals \n(9%). These three industrial activities accounted for more than 74% of the entire gross value of products in large- and medium-scale manufacturing organizations during the same period.\nIn terms of the value added by the large- and medium-scale industry sub-sector, the \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

(Belayneh, Weldeselassie, Legesse, Tasew, Denu, & Bansal, 2011).\nii.Employment Contribution\nThe industrial sector, in general, and the manufacturing sub-sector, in particular, serves as important sources of employment, especially for the rapidly growing urban population in Ethiopia. In 2007/08, there were 1,677,906 persons engaged, out of which 678,911 were employees in the industrial sector. The number of persons engaged and employees during this period showed an increase of 6.4 and 5.8 percent, compared to that of 2006/07, respectively. These increases in the number of persons engaged and employees could be attributed to the increase in the number of establishments created in 2007/08. (Ibid).\nWhen we examine the employment capacity of each industrial group in the \nmanufacturing sector, as of 2007/08:\n•\tThe food and beverage group employed 50%,\n•\tThe non-metal, and paper and printing industrial groups contributed 14% and 10.9% of the sector’s employment, respectively.\nThese three industrial groups, together, employed close to 75% of the total workforce in the manufacturing sub-sector for the year 2007/08.\nThe relative importance of the rest of the industrial groups, in terms of employment, \nvaries between 2.1% in wood and furniture manufacturers to 8.8% in textile-product manufacturers. The decline in the share of employment of these sectors is mainly due to increased employment opportunities in other industrial groups such as in non-metal, paper and printing.\niii.Foreign Exchange Contribution\nMore than 90% of the nation’s foreign currency earnings come from the agricultural sector. The poorly developed industrial sector of Ethiopia contributes very little to the foreign currency earnings of the nation.\nTextiles generate 41.5% of the sector’s foreign exchange, which is the largest \ncontribution.

However, it contributes the largest share to the GDP, export trade earnings, and employment. It also provides raw materials for the various industries in the country to a great extent.

Since the 1970s, development economists have come to realize that the agricultural sector needs to be viewed as a leading and dynamic sector. They further state that, without the development of the agricultural sector, the growth of the industrial sector will become weak.

To do this, GDP (which we denote as Y) is divided into four components: consumption (C), investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX). \nWhen studying changes in the economic performance of a country over time, \neconomists want to separate the nominal effect and the real effect of this change. In particular, they want a measure of the total quantity of goods and services  the \neconomy is producing that is not affected by changes in the prices of those goods and services (RGDP).\nOn the eve of the February 1974 revolution, the state of the Ethiopian economy \nexhibited respectable moderate rates of growth of GDP and per capita GDP , although it had begun to show signs of deceleration towards the end.

Process Innovation\nProcess innovation is about implementing a new or improved production or delivery \napproach, including changes in operational methods, the techniques used and the equipment or software.\nExamples:\nyThe first firms betting on SaaS (software as a service) technology, and using, for \ninstance, cloud contact centers from Talk desk, changed the way their customer support processes used to be organized\nyThe first hotels that decided to make decisions based on big data using, for instance, insights from the Climber Hotel, made changes on their decision-making approach\nIII . Product Innovation\nProduct innovation is the introduction of a new or improved good or service. These \ninventions or changes may have to do with improving technical specifications, the materials or the software used or even advancing on UX (user experience). However, product innovations don’t need to improve all functions or performance specifications. An improvement to or addition of a new function can also be merged with a loss of other functions or the downgrade of some other specifications.\nMoreover, a product innovation must add available to potential users but doesn’t \nnecessarily need to generate sales. Because if it did, then innovations with low demand or, for instance, digital products like apps that are free would be excluded. At the same time, routine changes or updates aren’t considered product innovations as they are only correcting errors or making some seasonal changes.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

First, \nfrom a sustainable development perspective, as it promotes sustainability throughout a product’s entire life cycle, it helps to address challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity, and biodiversity. Second, it can also boost a company’s performance and competitiveness. By embracing new and greener processes, technologies and services, eco-innovation can help organizations access new markets, increase productivity and profitability across the value chain, strengthen their reputation or attract new investors.\nExample:\nyA while ago, Procter and Gambler realized householders could save on their \nelectricity bill by switching to cold-water washings and started developing cold-water detergents (product innovation)\nyAs part of its sustainability strategy, IKEA is changing its fleet to electric vehicles (process innovation)\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

One of his most famous arguments has to do with the concept of “creative destruction”. In Schumpeter’s vision, capitalism is a dynamic and innovative market system that is constantly changing. These changes, he says, happen because of new ideas and processes that take over the current paradigm (status quo) and create new ways of producing goods, services or entirely new industries.\nThe claims destruction and imbalance are what makes capitalism develop and grow, \nand not the usually accepted idea of economic equilibrium. In this way, the Austrian economist calls this imbalance “creative destruction” because innovation often leads to market chaos: for instance, products get obsolete, companies close and people get unemployed. Still, he believes these are necessary consequences for new solutions that increase life quality to come to light.\nWe’ve been watching these examples of creative destruction across humankind’s \nhistory. We’ve gone over the first industrial revolution to the boom in using petroleum and we today we are a highly technological society of information. These periods of innovation make the old models obsolete and create the need for everyone and everything to innovate – and the transformation is drastic.\nFrom a business perspective, only companies with a great strategic vision survive an \nepisode of creative destruction. Companies like Nokia and Kodak, that were once market leaders in their own industries, failed to see how the cellphone and photography industries would change. At the same time, from a sustainability strategy, as we’ve discussed upper on this article, companies making radical changes and developing true sustainability strategies (from managing waste in a circular way to using renewable energy) will probably be the ones thriving in the future.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

While these two types of businesses have a lot in common, there are some key differences that you should know about when creating your company so that you don’t make any critical mistakes early on.\nThe initial decisions that you make when forming your business will fuel your early \nsuccess or cause you to experience numerous hurdles at a time when you likely don’t know how to navigate such problems. While there are no strict guidelines that determine what a startup is, the general definition of a startup is any company that’s in the initial stages of operations but expects significant growth in the near future.\nFor many organizations, innovation is difficult to understand and execute. There \nremains a clear discrepancy between how big business and start-ups approach it. As a result, big business is looking to start-ups and entrepreneurs to identify disruptive ideas and opportunities for their business, and to unlock innovation through the spirit, blood, sweat and tears of entrepreneurship.\nOn the other hand, a small business is any kind of business that only has a certain \nnumber of employees, the maximum of which differs by industry. Though these types of businesses may sound the same, understanding the differences between the two will be integral to your future success as an entrepreneur.\nStartups are entirely different than small businesses when it comes to business growth \nand revenue. For instance, startups are focused primarily on top-end revenue and growth potential. A startup is considered to be a temporary business model wherein the focus is on rapid growth.

While small businesses are perfectly content with \noperating in a small portion of a large market, startups usually want to obtain as much market share as they can with the product or service that they provide.\nStartups won’t be profitable in the initial stages of business development since they \nwant to grow within the shortest time possible. It will sometimes take years for a startup to make its first dollar of profit. The main goal is to create a product or service that can be successfully placed on the market, which could bring in millions of dollars of profit in the long run. Among the most successful startups is Uber, which now has a market value of $50 billion. Whether your goal is to create a small business or startup, you should know the difference between these two business types when forming your own company.\nStartup businesses are attempting to create a product or service that’s viable on the \nmarket, they will usually need to put in significant amounts of capital for product development, which usually can’t be done without the right investments. In many cases, startups will obtain funding from angel investors or venture capital firms.\nFunding for most startups involves seed funding, which means that the startup will \napproach potential angel investors for money. These investors are individuals who want to invest in a company that they believe is going to eventually make it big. These investors will get a share of the business for their money, which usually equates to 5-10 percent. \nActivity 8.2 \n1. Define startup businesses \n2.

What are businesses organizations? \n2. What are the types of business organizations?\nBusiness organizations may be owned and managed by a single individual or group of \nindividuals who may form a partnership firm or a joint stock company. Such arrangement of ownership and management is termed as a form of business organization. A business organization usually takes the following forms: sole ownership, partnership business and Corporations.\n8.3.1 Sole Proprietorship \nThe term ‘sole’ means single and ‘proprietorship’ means ownership. So, only one person is the owner of the business organization. This means that a form of business organization in which a single individual owns and manages the business, takes the profits and bears the losses, is known as sole proprietorship form of business organization. A type of business unit where one person is solely responsible for providing the capital and bearing the risk of the enterprise, and for the management of the business. It is very simple to establish a sole proprietary concern. Any person who is willing to start a business and has the necessary resources can set up this form of business organization. To start and operate the business in this form, practically does not require any legal formalities to be fulfilled. In some cases, like restaurant, chemist shop etc. however, permission from the competent authority is required to be obtained before starting the business.\nCharacteristics of Sole Proprietorship Form of Business Organization\na) Single Ownership- This business organization has a single owner who himself/\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

Thus, its formation is quite easy and simple.\nd)No Separate Entity:  The business unit does not have an entity separate from \nthe owner. The businessman and the business enterprise are one and the same, and the businessman is responsible for everything that happens in his business unit.\ne) No Sharing of Profit and Loss: The sole proprietor enjoys the profits alone. At \nthe same time, the entire loss is also borne by him. He alone bears the risks and reaps the profits.\nf)Unlimited Liability:  The liability of the sole proprietor is unlimited. In case \nof loss, if his business assets are not enough to pay the business liabilities, his personal property can also be utilized to pay off the liabilities of the business.\ng) One-man Control: The controlling power of the sole proprietorship business \nalways remains with the owner.

The partners divide the profits of the business among themselves. In general partnerships, all partners have unlimited liability. In limited partnerships, \ncreditors cannot go after the personal assets of the limited partners.\nCharacteristics of partnership form of business organization Based on the definition of \npartnership as given above, the various characteristics of partnership form of business organization, can be summarized as follows:\na)Two or More Persons: To form a partnership firm at least two persons are required. The maximum limit on the number of persons is ten for banking business and 20 for other businesses. If the number exceeds the above limit, the partnership becomes illegal and the relationship among them cannot be called partnership.\nb)Contractual Relationship:  Partnership is created by an agreement among \nthe persons who have agreed to join hands. Such persons must be competent to contract. Thus, minors, lunatics and insolvent persons are not eligible to become the partners. However, a minor can be admitted to the benefits of partnership firm i.e., he can have share in the profits without any obligation for losses.\nc)Sharing Profits and Business: There must be an agreement among the partners to share the profits and losses of the business of the partnership firm. If two or more persons share the income of jointly owned property, it is not regarded as partnership.\nd)Existence of Lawful Business: The business of which the persons have agreed to share the profit must be lawful. Any agreement to indulge in smuggling, black marketing etc. cannot be called partnership business in the eyes of law.\ne)Principal Agent Relationship: There must be an agency relationship between the partners. Every partner is the principal as well as the agent of the firm. When a partner deals with other parties, he/she acts as an agent of other partners, and at the same time the other partners become the principal.\nf)Unlimited Liability:  The partners of the firm have unlimited liability. They \nare jointly as well as individually liable for the debts and obligations of the firms. If the assets of the firm are insufficient to meet the firm’s liabilities, the personal properties of the partners can also be utilized for this purpose.

A lot of time, resources and money can be saved in knowing what to do and the order in which to do it. A good rule of thumb is to never commission a business plan until a feasibility study has been completed first. A proof of business concept, also known as a feasibility study, is normally less than 20% of the cost of a business plan and although a feasibility study will not be anywhere close to the in-depth “nuts and bolts” view of a business plan, it will do exactly what the name implies. It will show if a project is feasible before any other steps are taken or major financial burden is incurred. There are very big differences between a feasibility study and a business plan.\n8.4.2 Feasibility Studies\nA feasibility study is designed to discover if a business or project is “feasible” or if it is not: (In short, does the business or project warrant further investment of time, money and further study or is it a non-starter). A feasibility study is a relatively inexpensive way to safeguard any wastage of further investment (will it work or won’t it). If a project is seen to be feasible from the results of the study, the next logical step is to commission a full business plan. Will the investment made in the feasibility study itself then be wasted? No. Because the research and information uncovered in the study will be of good use in the business planning stage and will also reduce the research time and therefore the cost of the business plan. On the other hand, a business plan is designed to “plan” in advance how a business or project will be started, implemented and managed.

FEASIBILITY STUDIES demonstrate \nto a prospective project owner or investor that a given concept is financially viable and whether further study and/or a business plan is warranted. For a feasibility study, basic data is obtained through a series of queries, questions and meetings, wherein the client provides some of the research and other data and facts need to be gained from a variety of sources. The typical feasibility study contains, among other items, notes on financial projections, a general description of the business, general details describing how the company / project will be formed, managed and marketed, statements concerning the competition and a cash-flow projection based on averages. Further notes can be included as to general details of the project and revelations found during the research stage. The study will normally be completed quickly and in very general format compared to that of a business plan.\nA feasibility study should answer five questions. \n1.Will it work or not? \n2.Is it profitable or not? \n3.What will it basically cost to fund or start? \n4.Is it worth doing? \n5.Is it worth commissioning a business plan?\n8.4.2 Business Plans\nA business plan is a detailed road map for building a given company. A business plan \ncontains all that the feasibility study has plus specific timelines, detailed budgets with forecasts, letters of intent, resumes of staff, background, competition, strengths and weaknesses, work sheets (with full supporting references and notations) and appendi -\nces.

It will also show staffing levels and salaries along with costs of employment, sales levels with monthly and seasonal trends, setup costs, building/office costs, utility and telephone costs, legal, insurance and accounting costs, office furniture and supplies costs and a myriad of other costs and projections.

The process of preparing a feasibility plan is a testing process - a validation process to determine what could go wrong and what needs to go right for an enterprise to root and grow. Preparing a feasibility plan requires a tremendous amount of research and thinking, which often lead to significant changes in the original idea. The good news is that the stronger the feasibility plan the easier the business plan is to write and the more likely it is that your business will receive financial support and succeed.\nFeasibility Plan Narrative\nThe feasibility plan is not a formal document but it can be considered a structured formal commercial report. It is your first reality check. (The marketplace will be the real check.) As such, the plan should be very carefully thought through, extraordinarily well documented and clearly written. A feasibility study (proof of business concept) can exist in its own right or be in part of whole a supporting document (appendix) for the formal business plan. Within a formal business plan many decisions or business models will be used and the justification for those actions must be clearly demonstrated and this is often achieved by being able to reference to findings of the original business concept feasibility study\nA feasibility plan should at least touch on most issues included in the final business \nplan. In the feasibility plan, the focus is on getting the design right and testing its coherence, rather than on convincing investors and other partners to extend their support. Often the feasibility study’s validity is demonstrated through a cost benefit analysis. A cost - benefit analysis is a relatively simple and widely used technique for deciding whether a business model or decision is financially viable. As its name suggests, to use the technique simply add up the value of the benefits of a course of action, and subtract the costs associated with it.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

It’s an integral part of corporate, individual and even government decision making.\nEven when big companies like Macy’s (M) - Get Macy’s Inc Report move to repurchase \nhundreds of millions of dollars of their own debt, executives are using CBA. In fact, most actions undertaken by companies involve CBA in some form or other. \nBut what actually is cost benefit analysis, and how is it used? What are some examples \nof cost benefit analysis?  \nWhat is cost benefit analysis: Cost benefit analysis is a process used primarily by busi-\nnesses that weighs the sum of the benefits, such as financial gain, of an action against \nthe negatives, or costs, of that action. The technique is often used when trying to de-cide a course of action, and often incorporates dollar amounts for intangible benefits as well as opportunity cost into its calculations.\nAlthough CBA can be used for short-term decisions, it is most often used when a \ncompany or individual has a long-term decision.\nCBA is an easy tool to determine which potential decision would make the most \nfinancial sense for the business or individual. The process also takes indirect benefits or costs into consideration, like customer satisfaction or even employee morale. And opportunity cost often plays a big role when deciding between several options. When listing potential costs and benefits, companies or analysts will often factor in things like labor costs, social benefits and other factors that may not be immediately obvious. \nStill, CBA is similar to net present value (or NPV), which is often used by investors. So, what’s the difference between CBA and NPV?  \nCost Benefit Analysis vs. Net Present Value\nWhen performing a cost benefit analysis, or CBA, it is generally helpful to weigh the \ntotal benefits and total costs of a future project at their present value - which is where net present value comes in. Given that CBAs are often done with a long-term view \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

If the net present value is positive for the calculation (meaning the benefits outweigh the costs), the action or decision will generally be a good investment. If negative, the opposite is likely true.\nIn CBA, net present value is used to calculate net present costs and net present benefits.How to calculate Cost Benefit AnalysisFor standard CBA, the formula, the benefit/cost ratio, is fairly simple:Benefit/cost, simplified as b/c.Cost Benefit Analysis StepsCost benefit analysis is fairly simple to execute, and can be helpful when considering \na new course of action or strategy.\nStep 1: Compile listsThe first thing to do when running a cost benefit analysis is to compile a comprehensive \nlist of all the costs and benefits associated with the potential action or decision. \nConsider not only the obvious costs (like the cost of installation for new software, or \nfor the software itself) but also possible intangible costs like the opportunity cost of picking one software over another, or over another option like hiring a new employee. \nAdditionally, consider all the possible benefits of the course of action or decision - how \nmuch might it add to your revenue? What other benefits may be inherent in the action that would make it outweigh the costs? For example, would a new software improve efficiency or capabilities that could promote new business or make current operations run smoother? Be sure to also consider intangible benefits as well as obvious, fiscal ones.\nStep 2: Give the costs and benefits a monetary valueOnce you have two comprehensive lists of costs and benefits for the action, assignment. \nFor some, the values will be obvious - like the cost of installing the software might be $500. However, it is also important to try to assign monetary values to direct or indirect and tangible and intangible costs or benefits if possible. For example, installing a new \nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

If not, the company or individual should re-examine the potential action and make adjustments accordingly. \nThis equation can also be set up for multiple different options or projects and can help \ncompanies compare options side by side.\nĂActivity 8.4 \n1.What is business plan?\n2.What are the components of a business plan?\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"

It can be summarized into two key elements: creativity and implementation.\nBusiness Startups won’t be profitable in the initial stages of business development \nsince they want to grow within the shortest time possible. It will sometimes take years for a startup to make its first dollar of profit. \nThe main goal in business startups is to create a product or service that can be \nsuccessfully placed on the market, which could bring in millions of dollars of profit in the long run. Among the most successful startups is Uber, which now has a market \nvalue of $50 billion.\nBusiness organizations may be owned and managed by a single individual or group of \nindividuals who may form a partnership firm or a joint stock company. Such arrangement of ownership and management is termed as a form of business organization. A business organization usually takes the following forms: sole ownership, partnership business and Corporations.\nCost benefit analysis is a process used primarily by businesses that weighs the sum of \nthe benefits, such as financial gain, of an action against the negatives, or costs, of that action. The technique is often used when trying to decide a course of action, and often incorporates dollar amounts for intangible benefits as well as opportunity cost into its calculations.\nEthiofetena.com Ethiopian No 1 Educational Website"
