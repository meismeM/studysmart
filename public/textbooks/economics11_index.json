            "text": "INTRODUCTION\nEconomics, at its very heart, is the study of people. It seeks to explain what drives human \nbehavior, decisions and reactions when faced with difficulties or successes. When you study economics you gain a toolkit of skills, approaches and ways of thinking that you can apply to a wide range of problems.  Studying economics helps students gain the necessary skills so they can understand how economic markets around the world work. In the process, they build their analytical and problem-solving skills which will help them succeed now as students and in the future as working professionals. It enables people to understand people, businesses, markets and governments, and therefore better respond to the threats and opportunities that emerge when things change.  Lessons and assignments will help young adults become financially literate by exploring personal finance strategies pertaining to saving, budgeting, investing, and more. This will give students the knowledge necessary to make practical economic decisions and become savvy consumers.\nThis textbook is intended to support the learning of economic literacy so that students \npossess the tools to understand their economic world and how to interpret events that will, either directly or indirectly, affect them. Moreover, students will be supported to relate and translate economic literacy to explain economic reality on the ground. They will also be helped to acquire and develop their knowledge on what to expect in the future and how to manage their economic decisions.\nFinally, as per the Ethiopian General Education Curriculum Framework (GECF), \nEconomics for \nGrade 11  is one of the compulsory general subjects in Social Sciences and \nAgriculture. Career and Technical Education that offer economics as a course are Business Sciences, Language and Social Sciences, Performing and Visual Arts and Agriculture. Economics for \nGrade 11  (consisting of 7 units) is covered in the total of 87 hours and 45 \nminutes per year, 3 periods each week with 45 minutes per period. In line with the above expectations, the student profile and the textbook contents are presented below .\nSTUDENT PROFILE\nAt the end of Grade 11 Economics  study, students are expected to be in a better position \nin terms of the following:\nKnowledge\n\tKnowledgeable in subject area (principles, theories, applications, etc.)"

The remaining \nagents are business firms, government and the entrepreneurs. These agents pursue their own goals. Consumers, for instance, aim to maximize satisfaction from what they consume given their limited resources. \nIn this section, we study the satisfaction maximization behavior of a representative \nconsumer with pre-defined assumptions to shape the behavior of the agent.  We start the analysis by reviewing the cardinal utility theory followed by derivation of the demand curve.  The next activity is a study of consumer behavior using ordinal utility theory. \nThe key task in this unit is to study how a representative consumer makes the final \nconsumption decision and chooses from the alternative combination of goods and services. This will enable you to identify the quantities of goods and services that the consumer would buy and indicate the corresponding best utility. In the later parts of the unit, you will learn about responsiveness of the optimal combinations of goods to changes in either the price or the income of the consumer. This constitutes a post optimization analysis. \nLearning Outcomes  \nAt the end of this unit, you will be able to: \n\tdifferentiate between cardinal and ordinal utility approaches.\n\tdefine the concept of indifference set, curve and map and the theory of ordinal utility\n\t\ndetermine the optimum of the consumer using the ordinal utility approach"

It is an extra utility due to a change in consumption. The law of diminishing marginal utility says that as the amount of a good consumed increases, the marginal utility of the good decreases.\nCommodities are desired because of their ability to satisfy wants. Goods and services \nhowever, differ in their ability to satisfy wants. For example, an individual may choose coffee rather than tea. Another person may choose tea rather than coffee but both consumers will derive some level of satisfaction by consuming the good they have chosen. Given any \ntwo consumption bundles, the consumer can compare and decide that one of consumption \nbundles is better than another, or that they lead to the same satisfaction. The consumer is expected to state his/her preference.\nAs we saw in \nGrade 10 Economics , cardinal utility assumes that utility is measurable \nin absolute or cardinal numbers. The unit of measurement is called “utils”. We use the \nconcept of marginal utility, which is an extra utility or satisfaction from new consumption to show consumer optimum.\nThe consumer faces limited money income, and this shows that scarcity of resources and \nhence, choice is mandatory. We want to find the best choice for the consumer, and this is defined by the point at which the marginal utility ratios for any two goods equals the price ratios and the consumer spends his/her entire income. Alternatively, we can state consumer optimum is the point where marginal utility per money spent is the same for all commodities and income equals expenditure.\nSuppose that the consumer consumes two commodities X and Y then at optimum point: \n or  and income = expenditureXX X Y\nYY X YMU P MU MU\nMU P P P= =\nDerivation of the Demand Curve\nBased on the definition for consumer optimum, we can derive the demand curve for a \nconsumer.  The derivation of the demand curve is based on the concept of diminishing marginal utility which is discussed in the previous grade. If the marginal utility is measured using monetary units, the demand curve for a commodity is the same as the positive segment of the marginal utility curve (see \nFigure 1.1 )."

How do we measure it?\n2. Is utility maximization essential for you? How about for \nyour neighbors? \n3. Can people spend their income arbitrarily, i.e. without \nconsidering how best to use it?\nPreferences\nPreference is simply the ability of the consumer to state or express choices given \nalternatives. If a consumer faces two consumption bundles, say, X and Y , three things might happen. He/she may prefer X to Y , or Y to X or get same level of satisfaction from both X and Y . The first case is where the consumer prefers X to Y , and we can write it as X>Y\n. In the second case, the consumer prefers Y to X and hence, we can write the \nchoice as Y>X . Finally, when a consumer gets the same level of satisfaction from any two \ncombinations of goods, we say that the consumer is indifferent between the two goods or \nis unable to make choice of one good over another. This case is written as X~Y .\nWhen a consumer prefers a consumption bundle (x) to a bundle (y), it means that the \nx-bundle gives the consumer higher utility than the y-bundle. A  bundle (x) is preferred to \n(y) if and only if the utility of (x) is larger than the utility of (y).\nThe ordinal utility approach argues that utility cannot be measured in cardinal numbers as suggested by the cardinalist approach.  The consumer is expected to rank different consumption bundles according to his/her preferences. The ordinal utility concept is based on the fact that it may not be possible for consumers to express the utility of various commodities that they consume in absolute terms, like, 1 util, 2 utils, or 3 utils, but it is always possible for the consumers to express the utility in relative terms. Consumers would also be able to rank commodities in the order of their preference as 1\nst, 2nd, 3rd and \nso on.\nThis utility approach is based on some assumptions. We use indifference curves (ICs) \nto show satisfaction levels of consumers.  ICs are locus of points showing alternative"

Marginal rate of substitution is the slope of the indifference curve. \n\tComplete ordering: all possible combinations of goods can be ordered into preferred, \nindifferent or inferior combinations when compared to a given combination of the goods.\nThe total utility (U) of the consumer depends on the quantities of the commodities consumed, i.e.\n1 23    (  , , , , )U f x x x Xn= ….\nPreferences are transitive or consistent: it is transitive in the senses that if the consumer prefers market basket X to market basket Y , and prefers Y to Z, and then he/she must also prefer X to Z. \n\tConsistency of preference implies that if market basket X is preferred to market \nbasket Y (X>Y) then, Y cannot be preferred to X at another time (Y not >X) for the \nsame consumer.\n\tLimited money income: the consumer is confronted with limited money income so \nthat optimization is mandatory.

For example, if they are confronted with any two \nconsumption bundles A and B, A is preferred to B if A contains at least more of one commodity.  \n Activity 1.2\n1. Give examples from your community that supports the assumption of rationality.\n2. Do people buy and consume a good that reduces their satisfaction or utility?\nSome of the above listed assumptions are easy to understand and conceive while others need further elaboration. Rationality of agents is such a key assumption in consumer utility maximization process. We assume that consumers always aim for the best possible combination of the goods they buy that gives them the maximum possible satisfaction.   We will look the other assumptions after we study indifference curves.\n1.2.1 Indifference Curve, Set and Map\nAfter completing this section, you will be able to:\n\tdefine an indifference curve.\n\tdifferentiate between indifference curve and indifference map.\n\tdraw indifference curves.\nThe ordinal utility approach is based on two very important tools or instruments. One is the indifference curve while the other is budget line. First, let us discuss indifference curves and we will move on to the budget line. \nAn indifference curve (IC) is a concept used to represent an ordinal measure of the tastes \nand preferences of the consumer. Since it uses ICs to study the consumer’s behavior, the ordinal utility theory is also known as indifference curve analysis. There are three interrelated terminologies which are linked with concept of indifference: the indifference schedule (set), curve and map.\nIndifference set (schedule): this is a tabular presentation of the various combinations of"

It is a combination of \ngoods for which the consumer is indifferent, preferring none of the consumption bundles. \nTable 1.1  below is a typical indifference schedule that a consumer faces when comparing \ntwo goods. The numbers are hypothetical ones which are used to generate the standard shape of an IC. Under ordinal utility theory, we don’t measure utility in cardinal numbers as indicated in the table. We use the numbers to get familiar with the shape of an indifference curve in this approach. Once we have done that, we don’t rely on the cardinal numbers. \nThe consumer faces four different possible ways (A to D) of combining his/her consumption \nof the two goods leading to the same level of satisfaction. All the four combinations of the two good X and Y give the consumer an equal level of total utility. Thus, the individual is indifferent between the combination presented as A, B, C or D.\nLooking at \nTable 1.1 , combination B shows that the consumer faces 3 units of good (X), \nthe orange, and 15 units of good (Y), the banana and this generates the same utility as any \nother combination that is indicated in the table, say combination D where the consumer  has 7 units of orange, and 6 units of banana. In this movement, the consumer is buying more of one good (X) and less of another good (Y).\nIndifference curves: an indifference curve is a line that shows various combinations of two goods that provide the consumer with the same level of utility or satisfaction. It is the locus of points (combinations or bundles of goods), which yield the same utility (level of satisfaction) to the consumer, so that the consumer is indifferent between the combinations. An indifference curve is an iso-utility curve.\nIf we draw a graph based on the data in \nTable 1.1  above on a two-dimensional X-Y plane, \nwe get an indifference curve as shown. This is the conventional shape of an indifference \ncurve. There are other shapes of an IC that apply to some special types of goods."

Indifference  curves have a negative slope (downward sloping to the right): indifference \ncurves are negatively sloped because the consumption level of one commodity can be increased only by reducing the consumption level of another commodity for a movement along an indifference curve. This means, that if the quantity of one commodity increases with the quantity of another remaining constant, the total utility of the consumer increases. On the other hand, if the quantity of one commodity decreases with the quantity of another remaining constant, the total utility of the"

Hence, in order to keep the utility of the consumer constant, as the \nquantity of one commodity is increased, the quantity of another must be decreased.\n2. Indifference curves do not intersect each other: if they do intersect, the point of their \nintersection would mean two different levels of satisfaction from a single combination of goods, which is impossible. When ICs intersect, the transitivity rule is violated.  \nFigure 1.4 . shows that the problem with intersecting ICs. Combination E and C are on \nthe IC1 and hence, the consumer is indifferent between them. Similarly, combinations \nE and D are on the same IC2, and hence, must lead to the same utility. The transitivity \nrule means that the consumer should be indifferent between combinations C and D which is not true. The consumer prefers D to C as it contains at least more of the X good relative to C. Hence, indifference curves cannot intersect with each other .\n3. A higher indifference curve is always preferred to a lower one the further away from \nthe origin an indifferent curve lies, the higher the level of utility it denotes. Baskets of goods on a higher indifference curve are preferred by the rational consumer, as they contain more of the two commodities than the lower ones.\n4. Indifference curves are convex to the origin : this implies that the slope of an indifference \ncurve decreases (in absolute terms) as we move along the curve from the left downwards to the right. This assumption implies that the commodities can substitute one another at any point on an indifference curve, but are not perfect substitutes. \n1.2.3 The Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) \nMarginal rate of substitution of X for Y is defined as the number of units of commodity Y that must be given up in exchange for an extra unit of commodity of X so that the"

It is the rate at which one commodity \ncan be substituted for another while keeping the level of satisfaction the same. When a consumer continues to substitute X for Y , the rate goes on decreasing as the two goods are assumed to be imperfect substitutes in a standard case. \n,XYNumber of units of Y given upMRSNumber of units of X gained=\nThe MRSX,Y is a standard notation which shows how we want to increase consumption of \nthe first commodity (X) by sacrificing the second commodity (Y). If we write MRSX,Y it \nmeans that we want to know how much of the X-good that the consumer is willing to give up getting one more unit of the Y-good.  It is the negative of the slope of an indifference curve at any point for any two commodities such as X and Y , and is given by the slope of the tangent line at that point. Note that the slope of indifference curve is give as \n,XYyMRSx∆=∆.\nIn other words, MRS refers to the amount of one commodity that an individual is willing to give up to get an additional unit of another good while maintaining the same level of satisfaction or remaining on the same indifference curve. \nNote that (MRS\nX,Y) measures the downward vertical distance (the amount of y that the \nindividual is willing to give up) per unit of horizontal distance (i.e. per additional unit of \nx is required) to remain on the same indifference curve. That is,\n,XYYMRSX∆=∆\nBecause of the reduction in Y, MRS is negative.\nHowever, we multiply the value we get from the above expression by negative (-1) and express MRS\nX,Y as a positive value. We already know that there is a substitution between \ncommodities (i.e. when the quantity of X increases, the quantity of good Y decreases) which gives the MRS a negative value. For interpretation purpose, we convert the negative MRS to positive MRS. In addition; note that MRS is defined only for a movement along the same indifference curve.\nThe rationale behind the convexity of an indifference curve is that there is a fall in \nwillingness to exchange the two goods as more and more of the goods are traded.

Referring to Table 1.1  above, we can calculate \nMRS at various points on the IC. For example, MRSX,Y (between  points  A and  B) = ΔY/\nΔX = -8/2 = -4. The consumer is willing to forgo 8 units of banana to obtain 2 more unit \nof orange. For interpretation we say MRS= 4.\nMRSX,Y (between  points  B  and  C) = ΔY/ΔX = -6/2 = -3 and we use the absolute value and \nhence MRS = 3. If the consumer moves from point B to point C, he/she is willing to give \nup only 6 units of banana(Y) to obtain 2 unit of orange (X), so the MRS is 3 (∆Y/∆X = -6/2). Having still less of banana and more of orange at point C, the consumer is willing to give up only 3 unit of banana to obtain the same 2 units of orange. In this case, the MRS falls to 3/2. In general, as the amount of Y increases, the marginal utility of additional units of Y decreases. Similarly, as the quantity of X decreases, its marginal utility increases. \nOverall, the MRS decreases as we move downwards to the right. The diminishing slope \nof an indifference curve in absolute terms is the main reason why we have a convex IC in the standard case.  \n1.2.4 Marginal Utility and MRS\nThe point in this section is to show the derivation of the MRS using MU concepts. A utility function \nU(X, Y)  can be used to measure the marginal rate of substitution (MRS). Recall \nthat the MRS measures the slope of the indifference curve at a given bundle of goods. It shows the rate at which a consumer is willing to substitute a small amount of good Y for good X without affecting total satisfaction. When calculating MRS we are moving on the same indifference curve, and hence there is no change in the total level of satisfaction. The consumer gives up one good and receives another good to maintain the same level of satisfaction. This interpretation gives us a simple way to calculate the MRS. Consider a change in the consumption of each good, (ΔY , ΔX), that keeps utility constant so that the consumer is moving along the same indifference curve. \nThen, we must have:\nMU1 * ΔX + MU2 * ΔY = ΔU = 0\nThis is true because the gain in utility due to consumption of more units of good X is \ncanceled out by  a loss (decrease) in utility due to a decrease in consumption of good Y . Overall, the change in total utility due to such substitutions should be zero as far as the consumer is on the same indifference curve."

Note that we have Y as numerator on the left and as a denominator on the right-hand \nside of the equality. Similarly, X is the denominator on the left-hand side but a numerator \non the right-hand side. This is the standard expression and we need to note this. \nThe algebraic sign of the MRS is negative, showing that if you want to get more of good \nX you must get less of good Y in order to keep the same level of utility. The negative sign shows that the possibility of trade-off or substitution between the two goods. However, economists often refer to the MRS by its absolute value, that is, as a positive number. We will follow this convention. Hence, we can write MRS as:\n,X\nXY\nYMUMRSMU= . \n1.2.5 Special Types of Indifference Curves \nSo far, we have studied the shape of what is called a “standard indifference curve” which is downward sloping and convex to the origin. In this situation, we assume that the two commodities such as X and Y can substitute one another to a certain extent but are not perfect substitutes. There is imperfect substitutability between the two commodities. \nThis is not the only possible shape for an indifference curve and next we will introduce \ntwo additional shapes of an indifference curve depending on the assumptions about the nature of the goods we study. These are indifference curves for perfect substitutes and perfect complements.\nPerfect Substitutes : these are\n goods which can be substituted for one another at a constant \nrate. The two goods are essentially the same. If two commodities are perfect substitutes, \nthe indifference curve becomes a straight line with a negative slope. MRS for perfect substitutes is constant. All that matters to the consumer is the total number of the goods. A simple example is the case where the consumer faces a choice between a blue pen and a black pen. For many consumers, it does not matter whether you use a blue pen or a black pen. Hence, the consumer is willing to trade one black pen for one blue pen and will get the same level of satisfaction. Despite the number of exchanges, we assume that the rate of exchange remains the same (1:1 in this case). We say that the MRS between the two goods remains the same or it is constant."

It could be 2:1 or 2:3 or another \nnumber. What is important is that this rate remains the same no matter the number of exchanges we assume. In order to reflect this constant slope, the indifference curve is drawn as a straight line as shown in \nFigure 1.5 panel a .\nThe utility function is given as U(X, Y) = aX + bY , where a and b are constants and X and \nY are goods with perfect substitutability.\nPerfect Complements: these are goods which are to be consumed always jointly at a \nconstant rate. A typical example is where a consumer wears a left shoe with a right shoe. The combination is 1:1 in this case. Utility is defined by such combinations and having more of only the right shoe, keeping the left shoe constant at one does not change total satisfaction.\nIn terms of the shape of the indifference curve, we have a new shape due to the assumptions \nabout the two goods. If two commodities are perfect complements the indifference curve takes the shape of a right angle as indicated in panel b of \nFigure 1.5  panel b.

Discuss in groups of four and report what you have discussed to the whole class.\nNote that, in economics we study demand of a consumer but not wish of a consumer. A consumer needs some amount of income to buy goods and services. Demand is wish backed by purchasing power. The budget line gives a summary of the buying ability of a consumer.\nIn this section, we will study about the budget line and its properties. We start with a \ndefinition of the budget line. Next, we introduce a simple table providing a summary of possible combinations of two goods that a consumer would be able to buy with his/her available income and the prices of the two goods. We limit the analysis to two-goods case as it is not possible to study three or more goods on a two-dimensional X-Y plane. Assumptions of a budget line, slope of a budget line and finally changes in budget line will be discussed. \nIn the previous section, we saw that indifference curves show the rate at which the consumer \nis willing to substitute one good for another, utility remaining the same. Indifference curves only tell us the consumer’s preference for any two goods; they cannot tell us which combination of the two goods will be chosen or bought. In this section, we will introduce a line which summarizes the buying abilities of a consumer. \nA utility maximizing consumer would like to reach the highest possible indifference curve \non his/her indifference map. But the consumer’s decision is restricted by his/her income and price of the two commodities. Therefore, in addition to consumer preferences, we need to know the consumer’s income and price of the goods. In other words, individual choices are also affected by budget constraints that limit people’s ability to consume given the prices they must pay for various goods and services."

A budget line is a line or a graph \nwhich indicates different combinations of two goods that a consumer can buy with a given income at a given prices. In other words, the budget line shows that the basket of goods that consumers can purchase, given their income and prevailing market prices. Together with an indifference curve, a budget line is an important function which is required to derive consumer optimum.  Next, we will study the assumptions and properties of a budget line.\nAssumptions to Draw a Budget Line\nIn order to draw the budget  line facing the consumer, the following assumptions are important.\n\tThere are only two goods, X and Y , bought in quantities  X and Y\tEach consumer is confronted with market determined prices, Px  and Py, of good \nX and good Y respectively  \n\tThe consumer has a known and fixed money income (M). \nA change in any of these assumptions leads to a change in the position of the budget line and this will be studied later.\nThe Budget Constraint or Budget Equation \nIf the consumer spends all his/her income on two goods (X and Y), we can express the budget constraint as:\nXY M  P X  P Y= + , where, PX = price of good X, PY = price of good Y , X = quantity of \ngood X, Y= quantity of good Y , and M = consumer’s money income.  \nThe budget constraint is sometimes called the “budget equation”. According to the above budget equation, the amount of money spent on X plus the amount spent on Y equals the consumer’s money income.\nFor example, a household has 100 Birr per month to spend on bread (X) at Birr 4 each and \nSugar (Y) at Birr 20 each. That is\n PX = 4, PY = 20, M = 100birr.\nTherefore, our budget line equation will be: 4X + 20Y = 100."

What are the factors that affect the position of a budget line?\n2. Mention at least two factors that might cause a change in a budget \nline.\nAs we have seen above, the budget line depends on the price of the two goods and the income of the consumer. Any change in the price of the goods or the income of the consumer results in a shift in the budget line. Let us examine the impact of these changes one by one.\nThe tips to understand the effect of these factors is to examine how the three important \nproperties of a budget line change. These are changes in the slope, the X-intercept, and the Y-intercept of the budget line due to the suggested changes being considered.\n1.3.3 Effects of Changes in Income\nIf the income of the consumer changes (keeping the prices of the commodities unchanged) the budget line also shifts (changes). Increase in income causes an upward shift of the budget line that allows the consumer to buy more goods and services. In contrast to this, a decrease in income leads to a downward shift of the budget line that leads the consumer to buy less of the two goods. In order to show this, what we need to do is to calculate the new X and Y intercepts with the new income. Since the X-intercept is given as M/P\nx, a rise in \nincome increases the maximum amount of good X that the consumer can buy. Similarly, the maximum amount of good Y that the consumer can buy is given by M/Py and an increase in income increases the quantity that can be bought of good Y . Connecting these two points will give us a new budget line. \nFigure 1.7 .presents a parallel shift in budget line \ndue to changes in consumer income.  \nIt is important to note that the slope of the budget line (the ratio of the two prices) does \nnot change when income rises or falls. The budget line shifts from Bo to B1 when income \ndecreases and to B2 when income rises."

The preferences of a consumer are indicated by the indifference \ncurves and the budget line specifies the different combinations of X and Y which the consumer can purchase with the limited income. Therefore, the consumer tries to obtain the highest possible satisfaction within his/her limited budget or money income. \nThis occurs where an indifference curve is at a tangent to the budget line so that the slope \nof the indifference curve (MRS\nX,Y) is equal to the slope of the budget line (PX/PY). Thus, \nthe condition for utility maximization, consumer optimization, or consumer equilibrium occurs where the consumer spends all the income (i.e. the consumer is on the budget line) and the slope of the indifference curve equals to the slope of the budget line. Hence, at optimum position,\nX\nX,Y\nYPMRSP= .\nNote that, the consumer cannot purchase any bundle lying above and to the right of the budget line. This is true because, indifference curves above the region of the budget line are beyond the reach of the consumer and are irrelevant for equilibrium consideration. The question then arises as to which combinations of X and Y the rational consumer will purchase. Graphically, the consumer optimum or equilibrium is depicted in \nFigure 1.11 .\nAt point ‘A’ on the budget line, the consumer gets IC1 level of satisfaction. When he/\nshe moves down to point ‘B’ by reallocating his/her total income in favor of X he/she derives greater level of satisfaction that is indicated by IC\n2.

This equilibrium occurs at the point of tangency between the highest possible indifference curve and the budget line. Put differently, equilibrium is established at the point where the slope of the budget line is equal to the slope of the indifference curve.\n1.4.1 Effects of Changes in Income and Prices on Consumer’s Equilibrium\nNow we know how to arrive at the consumer optimum position. The next question is to study how this consumer optimum position changes when the income of the consumer changes or the price of the goods change.\nNote \nChanges in income and prices of the two goods are the main factors that cause a \nchange in the position of the budget line, and hence optimum position.\nLet us first consider the effect of a change in income on the equilibrium of the consumer all other things remaining constant. From our discussion on the budget line, we noted that an increase in the consumer’s income (all other things held constant) results in an upward parallel shift of the budget line. This allows the consumer to buy more of the two goods. On the contrary, when the consumer’s income falls, ceteris paribus, the budget line shifts downward, remaining parallel to the original one. \nConsider the case of an increase in income. Following the shifts in the budget line \noutward, the consumer will be able to meet one of the many ICs which were not previously achievable. This creates a new equilibrium position. A further increase in income shifts the budget line outward and hence another equilibrium position will be achieved and so on. We have several consumer optimum positions following the change in income as shown in \nFigure 1.12 . The points R and S show that the new optimum points following the increase \nin income.\nIf we connect all the points representing equilibrium market baskets corresponding to all \npossible levels of money income, the resulting curve is called the income consumption"

ICC is a locus of points representing various combinations of the two \ncommodities that are purchased by the consumer at different levels of income, all other \nthings remaining the same. The ICC joins the points of consumer optimum (equilibrium) as income changes (ceteris paribus). Or, it is the locus of consumer equilibrium points resulting when only the consumer’s income varies.\nFigure 1.12  shows that the ICC of a normal commodity case. Normal goods are goods for \nwhich consumption increases with income. Examples are meat and milk. There are other goods called “inferior good” of which consumption decreases as income of the consumer increases. Traveling by public bus is a typical example of an inferior good. Note that for some people travelling by bus could be a normal good if they were travelling on foot previously. In general, however, as income increases or as people get richer, they tend to reduce their consumption of inferior goods. \nFinally, a change in price of one or both of the goods changes the position of the budget \nline and hence, affects consumer optimum. This process leads to a new curve called the “price consumption curve” which is discussed below in detail.\n1.4.2  Price Consumption Curve and Deriving the Demand Curve\nHere, we study the effect of change in price on the consumption of goods holding money income constant. In the discussion of budget line, we saw that an increase in the price of good X, for example, decreases the maximum amount of good X that the consumer can buy without affecting  the vertical (Y) intercept of the line. In this case, the budget line rotates inward on the X-axis as presented in \nFigure 1.13 .\nA decrease  in the price of X will result in outward rotation of the budget line and this"

What are the assumptions of perfectly competitive market?\n2. Compare and contrast a perfectly a competitive market with a \npure monopoly market?\n3.  How do perfectly competitive firms make price and output decisions?\nThe characteristics of perfectly competitive market imply that every firm is insignificant as compared to the market size and since the product that it supplies is by no means different from the products supplied by other firms in the market, each individual firm cannot determine the prices for goods and services that are supplied to the market.  In these markets, the prices for goods and services are determined by the interaction of all consumers and producers in the market, i.e. the interaction of demand and supply forces. Then, every firm will assume this price as a given and make its decision accordingly . \n2.2.1 Demand, Revenue and Cost Curves  \nIn Figure 2.1 , price is on the Y-axis and quantity is on the X-axis. Panel A represents the \nindustry and Panel B represents the case of a firm. The market demand curve is DD and \nthe market supply  curve is SS. Furthermore, the point at which the market’s demand and \nsupply curves intersect with each other is the equilibrium point. The price at this level is the equilibrium price and the quantity is the equilibrium quantity. All firms receive this price in a perfectly competitive market. As a result, in the perfectly competitive market firms are the price-takers and the industry is the price-maker. This implies that every individual firm in such markets faces a horizontal demand curve, indicating that the firm can sell whatever quantity (Q) of goods at the market-determined price. The average  revenue curve is the \ndemand curve of the firm."

Does maximizing profit (producing where MR = MC) imply an actual economic profit?\nAs shown in \nFigure 2.7 , the answer is that shutting down can reduce variable costs to \nzero, but in the short run, the firm has already paid for fixed costs. As a result, if the firm produces a quantity of zero, it would still make losses because it would still need to pay for its fixed costs. So, when a firm is experiencing losses, it must face a question: should it continue producing (break even) or should it shut down?\nIf price falls in the zone between the shutdown point and the zero profit point (breakeven \npoint), then the firm is making losses but will continue to operate in the short run, since it is covering its variable costs. However, if price falls below the price at the shutdown point, then the firm will shut down immediately, since it is not even covering its variable costs. The intersection of the average variable cost curve and the marginal cost curve, which shows the price where the firm would lack enough revenue to cover its variable costs, is \ncalled the  “shutdown point” “ (see Figure 2.8 )."

The supply curve indicates the relationship between price and quantity supplied. In other words, supply curve shows the quantities that a seller is willing to sell at different prices. That way, if the firm shuts down, it has to bear fixed costs. That is why in the short run, the firm will supply commodity till price is either greater or equal to average variable cost. Thus a firm will continue supplying the commodity till marginal cost is equal to price or average revenue.  As a result short run supply curve of a perfectly competitive firm is that portion of marginal cost curve which is above average variable cost curve. \nFrom \nFigure 2.9 , it is clear that there is no supply if price is below OP1. At price less \nthan OP1, the firm will not be covering its average variable cost. At OP1 price, OQ1 is the \nsupply. In this case, firms’ marginal revenue and marginal cost cut each other at M and \nOQ1 is equilibrium output. If price goes up to OP2, the firm will produce OQ2 output. This \nfirm’s short run supply curve starts from A upwards through B (SS)."

It is also a production period that allows the entrance and exit of firms into and out of the market. So, the most important variable that determines the long - run equilibrium of perfectly competitive markets is the adjustment to the number of firms in the market. In other words if the firms, which are already in the industry, are making pure economic profits, then new firms will start to enter the market since the return in the industry is larger than the return that can be generated somewhere else. \nOn the other hand, if firms are making economic losses in a given industry in the short \nrun, after making all the necessary adjustments if these losses cannot be eliminated in the long run, then firms will start to leave the market since the return in the industry under consideration is smaller than what can be earned elsewhere. Therefore, this adjustment to the number of firms in the market will continue until there is no more incentive for new firms to enter into the market as well as for the existing firms to leave from the market. i.e. at that point where firms are earning a return in a given industry which is exactly the same as the returns elsewhere, then the firm is said to be at a long-run equilibrium."

This curve is tangential to \nthe market price defined demand curve. In the long run, a firm just earns normal profits. If a firm earns supernormal profits in the short run, then the industry will attract new firms into it. Eventually, this leads to a fall in prices of the goods and an increase in prices of the factors as the industry expands. These changes continue until the LAC curve is tangential to the demand curve.\nOn the other hand, if firms make losses in the short run, then they leave the industry in the \nlong run. This results in a rise in price and a drop in costs as the industry contracts. These changes continue until the remaining firms in the industry cover their total costs and make normal profits.\nIn Figure 2.10 , OP is the price and the firm which is making supernormal profits by \nworking with the plant whose cost is SAC1. Therefore, the firm has an incentive to build \nnew capacity and move along its LAC. Simultaneously, the excess profits attract new firms to the industry.

What are the sources of monopoly? \nMonopoly is at the opposite end of the spectrum of market models to perfect competition. \nA monopoly  firm has no rivals; rather it is the only firm in its industry. There are no close \nsubstitutes for the good or service a monopoly produces. Not only does a monopoly firm have the market to itself, but it need not worry about other firms entering. In the case of monopoly, entry by potential rivals is prohibitively difficult.\nA monopoly does not take the market price as given; it determines its own price. It selects \nfrom its demand curve the price that corresponds to the quantity that the firm has chosen to produce in order to earn the maximum profit possible. The entry of new firms, which eliminates profit in the long run in a competitive market, cannot occur in the monopoly \nmodel. A firm that sets or picks price based on its output decision is called a  price setter. A \nfirm that acts as a “price setter” possesses  monopoly power. \n2.3.1 Demand, Revenue and Cost under Monopoly \nAt the end of this section, you will be able to: \n\tunderstand the shape of a demand curve under monopoly."

However, the firm’s demand curve as perceived by a monopoly is the same as the market demand curve. The reason for the difference is that each perfectly competitive firm perceives the demand for its products in a market that includes many other firms; in effect, the demand curve as perceived by a perfectly competitive firm is a tiny slice of the entire market demand curve. In contrast, a monopoly perceives demand for its product in a market where the monopolist is the only producer .\nAs shown in Figure 2.11 , a monopolist perceives the demand curve that it faces to be the \nsame as the market demand curve, which for most goods is downward-sloping.

The cost curves (TC, AC and MC) have their typical shape as discussed in “perfect competitive market”. \nTotal revenue, by contrast, is different from perfect competition.  Since a monopolist faces \na downward - sloping demand curve, the only way it can sell more output is by reducing its price.\nIt is assumed that the shapes of cost curves confronting a monopolist are the same as those \nfaced by a perfectly competitive firm. Most will have low marginal costs at low levels of production, reflecting the fact that firms can take advantage of efficiency opportunities as they begin to grow.

How do we determine price and output in a monopoly market?\n2. What kind of profit can a monopolist earn?\nShort - run Equilibrium of the monopolist is a point where profits are maximized or losses are minimized. There are two approaches that indicate the equilibrium position, namely, total revenue - total cost (total approach) and marginal revenue-marginal cost (marginal approach).\n1. Total Revenue-Total Cost Approach \nAnalogous to the perfectly competitive firm, the monopolist reaches maximum profit when it produces and markets output levels that result in a greatest positive difference between total revenue and total cost, (or minimizes loss when, the negative difference between total revenue and total cost is least). \nWe can illustrate profits for a monopolist with a graph of total revenues and total costs, \nusing the data for the monopoly firm in \nTable 2.3 .  Total revenue for the monopoly firm \nfirst rises, then falls. Low levels of output bring in relatively little total revenue as the quantity is low. High levels of output bring in relatively less revenue as the high quantity pushes down the market price. The total cost curve is upward sloping and the curve grows steeper as output increases. Profits will be highest at the quantity of output where total revenue is most above total cost (at three unit quantity demanded). The profit-maximizing level of output is not the same as the revenue-maximizing level of output, which should make sense, because profits take costs into account and revenues do not."

What do you think price discrimination is?\n2. Have you ever faced price discrimination in a market?\nPrice discrimination occurs when a monopolist sells different units of output at different \nprices. The objective is to maximize profit (revenue) by receiving consumer surplus. The monopolist practices price discrimination to various degrees. The degree of price discrimination refers to the extent to which a seller can divide the market and can take advantage of it in extracting the consumer surplus. In economic literature, there are three degrees of price discrimination which are practiced by the monopolist. There are three types of price discrimination – first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree.\n1. First degree  (or perfect/primary)  price discrimination  requires the monopoly seller \nof a good or service to know the absolute maximum price (or  reservation price ) that \nevery consumer is willing to pay. By knowing the reservation price, the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price he/she is willing to \npay, and thus transform the  consumer surplus  into revenues. So, the profit is equal to \nthe sum of consumer surplus and  producer surplus. The marginal consumer is the one \nwhose reservation price equals to the marginal cost of the product. The seller produces more of his/her product than he/she would to achieve monopoly profits with no price \ndiscrimination, which means that there is no  deadweight loss. This is sometimes \nreferred to as “take or-leave-it” price discrimination; since the monopolist charges the maximum price that the consumer is willing to pay otherwise denying the sale of any"

In \nthis case, the demand curve also becomes the MR curve of the monopolist. Example:  \nConsider the case of service which is provided by a medical doctor. A doctor who knows or guesses the paying capacity of his/her patient can charge the highest possible price presumably that the richest patient can pay and the lowest fee to the poorest one. In practice, first-degree discrimination is rare.\n2. Second degree price discrimination, or nonlinear pricing, occurs when prices differ \ndepending on the number of units of the good bought, but not across consumers. That is, each consumer faces the same price schedule, but the schedule involves different prices for different amounts of the goods purchased. Quantity discounts or premium are the obvious examples. Price varies according to quantity demanded. Larger \nquantities are available at a lower unit price. This is particularly widespread in sales to industrial customers, where bulk buyers enjoy higher discounts. In reality, different pricing may apply to differences in product quality as well as quantity. For example, airlines often offer multiple classes of seats on flights, such as first class and economy class. This is a way to differentiate consumers based on preference, and therefore, allows the airline to capture more consumers’ surplus.\n3. Third degree price discrimination , means charging a different price to different \nconsumer groups and it is the most common type.  The monopolist divides the \nentire market into submarkets and different prices are charged in each submarket. Therefore, third-degree price discrimination is also termed as “market segmentation”. If a monopolist is faced with two or more markets, completely separated from each other each having a demand curve with different elasticity, then the monopolist is required to allocate its output between the different markets so that it can maximize profit in all markets. Profit in each market is maximized only when MC = MR in each market. Thus, the monopolist allocates its output between the markets so that in all the markets MC = MR.  For instance, railways charge lower fares to senior citizens and Students get discount in cinemas, museums, and historical monuments.\nThere are several factors or bases for price discrimination: income of the consumers, geographical location, age, quantity of purchase, relationship with the seller, frequency of visit to the shop, are a few among others."

What is a monopolistic competition?\n2. What is a unique feature of a monopolistically competitive \nmarket?\nThe models of perfect competition and pure monopoly represent two forms of market structures.  But, we can immediately identify that some markets are quite different from either perfect competition or pure monopoly.  But the two models can be combined somehow to treat such cases. After all, many firms have some control over price, i.e. do not face a perfectly elastic demand curve, but are not really pure monopolists. The monopolistic competition lies between the two extremes of pure competition and monopoly. In real life, monopoly is relatively rare, for there are few suppliers in sole control of raw materials, and patent rights exist only for limited periods. It is therefore, difficult for suppliers to keep other suppliers from entering the industry to compete with them. The more usual situation is that the elements of monopoly exist alongside the elements of competition. It \ninvolves many  firms  competing against each other, but selling products that are distinctive \nin some way. Firms producing such products must also compete with other styles, flavors and brand names. The term “monopolistic competition” captures this mixture of mini-monopoly and tough competition. Examples include stores that sell different styles of clothing, restaurants or grocery stores that sell different kinds of food and even products like golf balls or beer that may be similar but differ in public perception because of advertising and brand names."

How do firms in the same industry such as fast-food vendors, gas \nstations, or chocolate companies differentiate their products?\n2. Is the difference mainly in the minds of consumers or in the products themselves? Discuss this in groups of four and report what you have discussed to whole class.\nWe call products that are distinctive in one way or other differentiated products. The \nconcept of differentiated products is closely related to the degree of variety that is available. If everyone in the economy wore only blue jeans, ate only white bread, and drank only tap water, then the markets for clothing, food, and drink would be much closer to being perfectly competitive. The variety of styles, flavors, locations and characteristics creates product differentiation and monopolistic competition.\nThe structure of a market is also affected by the extent to which those who buy from it prefer \nsome products to others. In some industries, the products are regarded as identical by their \nbuyers as, for example, basic farm crops. In others, the products are  differentiated  in some \nway so that various buyers prefer various products. Notably, the  criterion  is a subjective \none; the buyers’ preferences may have little to do with  tangible  differences in the products \nbut are related to  advertising, brand names, and distinctive designs. The degree of product \ndifferentiation as registered in the strength of buyer preferences ranges from slight to fairly large, tending to be greatest among infrequently purchased consumer goods and prestige goods, particularly those purchased as gifts. A firm can try to make its products different from those of its competitors in several ways: physical aspects of the product, location from which it sells the product, intangible aspects of the product, and perceptions of the product. \nA general class of product is differentiated if any significant basis exists for distinguishing \nthe good (or service) of one seller from those of others. Such a basis may be real or fancied, as long as it is of any importance whatever to buyers, and leads to a preference for one variety of the product over another. Product differentiation may reflect real differences among products, when the intrinsic characteristics of the products are different, or may"

Real differentiation occurs when there are differences in specification of the product, or differences in inputs, or location of the firm. For instance, sports wear shoes are produced by several firms and some are made of synthetic materials and some are made of leather. Spurious or fancied differentiation is established by advertising, difference in packaging, design, simple brand name and the like.  \nWhatever the bases for product differentiations are, the intention is to persuade the \nconsumer to accept some product as unique over the other and render for the firm a sort of \nmonopoly power. As a result of product differentiation, producers will get some discretion in the determination of price. The firm in this case is not a price-taker; rather it has some monopoly power which it can exploit.  However, it faces keen competition from producers of close substitute products. Thus, its discretion over price is limited.  In general, in this market structure, there are both monopolies as well as competition elements, hence the name of the model referred to us “monopolistic competition”.\n Activity 2.4\nProduct differentiation plays an even more crucial role in monopolistically competitive industries.  Identify how the firms in your area practice product differentiation and present your findings to the class.\nThe following are among the reasons why product differentiation plays a crucial role in monopolistic competitive industries: \tTacit collusion is virtually impossible when there are many producers. \tHence, product differentiation is the only way that monopolistically competitive \nfirms can acquire some market power. \nWhatever form it takes there are two important features of industries with differentiated products: \n1. Competition among sellers: producers compete for the same market, so entry by more producers reduces the quantity each existing producer sells at any given price."

Value in diversity: in addition, consumers gain from the increased \ndiversity of products. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \nA monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between monopoly and competition. The demand curve that a perfectly competitive firm faces is perfectly elastic (panel a), meaning it can sell all the output it wishes at the prevailing market price. The demand curve that a monopoly faces (panel b) is the market demand. It can sell more output only by decreasing the price it charges. The demand curve that a monopolistically competitive firm faces Panel c) falls in between. The demand curve as a monopolistic competitor faces is not flat, but rather downward-sloping, which means that the monopolistic competitor can raise its price without losing all of its customers or lower the price and gain more customers. Since there are substitutes, the demand curve facing a monopolistically competitive firm is more elastic than that of a monopoly where there are no close substitutes. \n2.4.2 Costs under Monopolistic Competition\nThe firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve, which implies a downward-sloping marginal revenue curve.  In the situation of monopolistic competition, if any firm wants to sell maximum quantity of its production then it has to decrease the cost.

But under monopolistic competition the product is differentiated. Therefore, there \nis no  “industry”  but only a “group” of firms producing a similar product. Each firm \nproduces a distinct product and is itself an industry. An operational definition of product group is that the demand for each single product is highly elastic and it shifts appreciably when the prices of other products in the group change. In other words, products forming the group should have high price and cross elasticity. In the product group, the demand for each product has high cross elasticity so that when the price of other products in the group changes, it shifts the demand curve. We will call the firms that are producing close substitutes “product groups”. For example, a firm producing soap, shampoo and chocolate cannot be called an industry. \n2.5  Oligopoly Market\nAt the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\tdiscuss collusive oligopoly and non-collusive oligopoly.\n\tidentify the similarities and the differences between collusive oligopoly and non-collusive oligopoly.\n\tdifferentiate oligopoly market from the other market structures.\nStart-up Activity\nHow do you differentiate an oligopoly market from the other market structures?"

In oligopoly, due to the small number of large firms and hence, the large market share of each firm, the actions of one firm affect and are affected by the actions of the other firms in the market, and this is known as “strategic interdependence”. At least some firms have large market shares and thus, can influence the price of the product. The oligopolistic firms are aware of their interdependence and always consider their rivals’ reaction when setting prices, output goals, advertising budgets and other business policies. When the firms sell homogeneous products such as cement, steel or aluminum, they are called “pure oligopolies” whereas if the firms are selling differentiated products, such as cold drinks and automobiles, they are called “impure” or “differentiated oligopoly”. Examples of oligopoly are the pharmaceutical market, the automobile, the steel, the photographic equipment and the beverage (including soft drinks) industries. Duopoly is a special case of an oligopoly where two firms operate and have power over the market. The aircraft manufactures Boeing and Airbus can be considered as duopolies.\nThere are two types of oligopoly: collusive and non-collusive oligopoly  \n2.5.1 Collusive Oligopoly\nCollusive oligopoly refers to a form of oligopoly in which the competing firms collude so \nas to minimize competition and maximize joint profit by reducing the uncertainties arising due to rivalry and selling the goods and services at a monopoly price. The oligopolists enter into a contract to establish the levels of price and output, in the market and the products sold are homogeneous. In this type of oligopoly firms know that if they increase or decrease their prices will be a shift in the demand curve, as the products that are offered by the entire firm are homogeneous so customers can purchase them from any of the firms. By deciding not to compete with each other, the firms can set up a monopoly price on the output to be produced by each firm. By doing this, oligopolists can achieve the maximization of joint profit, (i.e. by working as a single firm). In fact, firms enter into pricing agreements with each other instead of competing or price wars. Such agreements both explicitly (or formal) and implicit (or informal) may be called “collusion”. Collusion can be of two types:\n1. Cartels: the word ‘cartel’ is used for those agreements whereby a common sales agency exists which carries out the selling activities of all the member firms."

            "text": "2.5  Oligopoly MarketGrade 11 Economics Student Textbook\n62Producer firms enter into a formal agreement that states the price and output, of all \nfirms that are members of the cartel. So in a cartel firms, jointly fix the price and output policy by way of agreements. \n2. Price leadership: when a formal collusive agreement becomes difficult to launch, oligopolists sometimes operate on informal tacit collusive agreements. One of the most common forms of informal collusion is price leadership. Price leadership arises when one dominant firm initiates price changes and other firms follow. There is an implicit understanding between the oligopolists to coordinate prices, whereby the dominant firm initiates the price changes and all the other firms follow, or match the change in price. \nAll firms will aim to achieve more strength and power over rival firms. As a result, in an oligopolistic industry, a few powerful competitors emerge that cannot be eliminated easily by other powerful firms. Under these circumstances, some of firms act together or collude with each other to reap maximum advantage. \n2.5.2 Non-collusive Oligopoly\nNon-collusive oligopoly refers to the oligopoly in which firms are in competition with each other. They compete with each other and determine independently the price of their products. In other words, it is a market in which there are few firms, each firm pursues its own price and output policy independent of the rival firms. Thus, every firm tries to increase its market share through competition. This is because, there are only a few big firms in the market, there is cut-throat competition. Therefore, in this market, aggressive advertisement develops brand loyalty. The firms survive in a strategic environment, as they begin with a particular strategy without colluding with competitors.\nIn a non-collusive oligopoly:\n1. Firms are independent of each other.\n2.

They compete on the amount of output produced, independently and concurrently. \n•\tBertrand Model: in this model few firms produce homogeneous goods and sell them to many customers. Identical products are produced at a constant marginal cost. Each firm in the industry considers the price of competitors as fixed, at the time of determining the price to be charged. So, the prices are set independently. This model is similar to that of cournot except that the firms compete in terms of price. Here, they end up producing the competitive level of output.\nThough one can make unambiguous predictions about perfect competition as well as monopoly, this is not possible in the case of competition exists. It is, thus, a perplexing market structure. One important characteristic of an oligopoly market is interdependence among sellers. Each seller’s price-output decision is influenced by the perceptions of countermoves of rival sellers. Given the large number of possible reactions, we come up with different models based on different assumptions about the behavior of the rival sellers, the extent and form of exit and entry and the likelihood of collusion between firms. \n Activity 2.5\n1.

Alternatively, profits will be highest where marginal revenue, which is price for a perfectly competitive firm, is equal to marginal cost. If the market price which is faced by a perfectly competitive firm is above average cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm is making profits. If the market price is below average cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm is making losses.\nA monopolist is not a price taker. This is because when a monopolist decides what quantity \nto produce, it also determines the market price. For a monopolist, total revenue is relatively low at low quantities of output, because not much is being sold. Total revenue is also relatively low at very high quantities of output, because a very high quantity will sell only at a low price. Thus, total revenue for a monopolist will start low, rise, and then decline. The marginal revenue for a monopolist from selling additional units will decline. Each additional unit sold by a monopolist will push down the overall market price, and as more units are sold, this lower price applies to more and more units. The monopolist will select the profit-maximizing level of output where MR = MC, and then charge the price for that quantity of output as determined by the market demand curve. If that price is above average cost, the monopolist earns positive profits.\nMonopolistic competition refers to a market where many firms sell differentiated products. \nDifferentiated products can arise from characteristics of the good or service, location from which the product is sold, intangible aspects of the product, and perceptions of the product. If the firms in a monopolistically competitive industry are earning economic profits, the industry will attract entry until profits are driven down to zero in the long run. \nOligopolies can also be non-collusive, where firms do not cooperate or collude and \ntherefore live in a strategic environment and have to take into account the possible actions of rival firms and how to react. Therefore, members of an oligopoly may look to non-price competition, such as product development, to distinguish those products from that of competing firms, investing in research and development to increase their monopoly power and sales so giving them a competitive edge. \nReview Questions  \nPart I: True or False\nWrite “True” for the correct statements and “False” for the incorrect ones."

Have you ever heard or read about gross domestic product (GDP)?\n2. What do you think about GDP?\n3. Why is learning about GDP important?\nGross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services which are produced in a country each year. GDP captures the value of all current final products which are produced within the boundary of a country without considering the ownership of the products. What matters is that the goods are produced within the territory. GDP can be represented by the total income of everyone in the economy or total expenditure made on the economy’s goods and services by different agents.  GDP measurement is time specific. \nNote \n )Gross domestic product (GDP) : the total market value of all final goods \nand services produced annually within a country’ s borders each year.\n3.2.2 The concept of Gross National Product (GNP)\nGross national product (GNP) is the total market value of goods and services which are produced by the nationality of a given country for a given period.  From this definition we can easily identify that unlike GDP, GNP includes some outputs that are produced by a citizen of a country who is living abroad and excludes the output produced by foreign"

GNP captures market values of final goods which are produced \nby nationals of a country wherever they are.  It does not include production by non-nationals even though they operate in the country in question. \nNote \n )Gross national product (GNP) : the total market value of all final goods and \nservices which are produced annually by resources of a country irrespective \nof the location of these resources.\nHence, the major difference between the two is how they treat income that is received by foreign resources and national resources. The concept of net foreign factor income (NFFI) captures this deviation between GDP and GNP. NFFI is the difference between the aggregate amount that a country’s citizens and companies earn abroad and the aggregate amount that foreign citizens and overseas companies earn in that country. NFFI could be generally considered not to be substantial in most nations since payments which are earned by citizens and those paid to foreigners more or less offset each other. NFFI is sometimes written simply as net factor income (NFI).\nTherefore, GNP can be obtained from GDP by adding net factor payment to GDP.\nGNP  GDP  net foreign factor income= + .\nThis applies where net factor payment or income is the difference between factor payment \nfrom aboard and factor payment to abroad.  In other words, payments of factor income (wage, profit and rent) to the rest of the world are subtracted from receipts of factor income from the rest of the world.  For example, Ethiopians who own apartments in New York earn rental income for their building.  This income earned is included in USA GDP but not in the GNP of USA, but it is included in GNP of Ethiopia.\nNote \n )GDP  is a flow concept and not a stock measure.\nA stock is a quantity which is measured at a given point in time, whereas a flow is a quantity measured per unit of time. A flow shows the amount of new addition to the existing value while a stock shows the total accumulated value of something. Note that a flow represents the change in the stock.\nWhen building theories to explain economic variables, it is often useful to determine \nwhether the variables are stocks or flows and whether any relationships link them."

These are: the expenditure, the income, and the value-added approaches.\n3.3.1  The Expenditure Approach\nExpenditure approach of measuring GDP involves adding the market value of all \nfinal products in the economy over a given period of time. To compute GDP using the \nexpenditure approach, add the amount of money that is spent by buyers on final goods and services. A \nfinal good (or service) is a good in the hands of the final user, or ultimate \nconsumer. Examples include orange juice or mobile phones. \nThe words “ final goods and services ” are important in computing GDP for not all goods \nare final goods. This is because some goods are intermediate goods.  Intermediate goods \nare goods that are used as inputs in the production of other goods.

On the other hand, production of wheat flour could be \nboth a final and an intermediate good. It is a final good when it is bought by final consumer or intermediate good when it is used by a bakery to make a bread or cakes from the flour. In this case, the bread or cakes should be taken as final products. Hence, there is high risk of double counting in GDP measurement in this approach. \nDouble counting  is counting \na good more than once when computing GDP. If we measure the expenditure on both the wheat flour produced and the cakes in GDP computation, we will overestimate the GDP since we are double counting. \nNote \n )Intermediate god: a good that is an input in the production of a final good. \nThe expenditure approach of GDP accounting represents the demand for final goods and \nservices. This demand (expenditure) for domestically produced goods is comprised of \nfour main components depending on what makes the expenditure. These are consumer \nexpenditure (C), business investment (I), government expenditure (G) and foreign \nexpenditure or net export (NX).\nConsumption spending (C): spending made on domestically produced final goods and \nservices by household.  It is divided into three major subcategories. Expenditure made on durable goods, non-durable goods and services. Durable goods are goods whose life span is expected to be more than 3 years. Examples include household equipment such as sofas, beds, tables, etc.  Non-durable goods are goods which last for a short time such as cloth and food. Services include the work done for consumers by individuals and firms, such as haircutting, cleaning, training and doctor visiting.\nBusiness investment spending (I): spending on goods and services which are used for \nproduction of other goods.  It includes business fixed investments such as spending on new plants and equipment by firms, residential investment and inventory investment. Residential investment is the purchase of new housing by households. Inventory investment refers to changes in inventories of goods.\nGovernment purchase or spending (G): spending made on domestic goods and services \nby federal, state and local government.  It includes investment made by government on \ndifferent types of infrastructures, military equipment and spending made for services of \ngovernment employees."

In this approach, depending up on the owner of factor input, the components of GDP include the following:\n\tEmployment compensation payment made for labor in the form of wages and salaries.\n\tRent payments for use of land, building and other capital inputs.\n\tInterest income which is received by households on their saving deposit.\n\tProfit payments made to the owner of firms in return for the output produced after deduction of the cost of production. \nAggregating the above returns to factor input gives the national income of an economy.  So, to arrive at GDP, we add back \nindirect business ta xes (IBT) and depreciations to \nthe national income. Indirect business taxes like sales taxes are payments that represent \nthe difference between what buyers pay for final product and what sellers receive. They \nare income to the government.  Similarly, depreciation is capital consumption allowance \n(CCA) which represents consumption of fixed capital which can be considered as a cost \nof production. Depreciation is estimated saving from profits for future maintenance of the \nequipment.

Each stage involves separate market transaction and flow of income.  For example, there are four different stages having their own market transaction in production of bread.

Finally, the baker sells the bread to the consumer.\nUnder such cases, GDP can be estimated by calculating the value added at each stage of \nproduction.

Nominal GDP is the value of goods and services measured at current prices. Real GDP rises only when the amount of goods and services has increased, whereas nominal GDP can rise either because output has increased or because prices have increased.\nMathematically, GDP is the sum of market values (\n*iiPQ ) of all current final goods for all \nconsumers.

Real GDP is GDP adjusted for price changes. It is GDP computed using a base-year price.\nNominal GDP rises much more rapidly than real GDP since prices tend to move upwards \nover time. The difference between the growth rate of nominal and real GDP occurs because the price of goods is rising over time or there has been inflation. That is, real GDP shows what would have happened to expenditure on output if quantities had changed but prices had not. For the base year, for instance, real GDP equals nominal GDP since they both use the same price and quantity.  Hence, the deviation of the nominal GDP from the real GDP would be larger during inflation.\nGrowth in real GDP is associated with changes in real factors such as changes in available \namount of capital and labor resources in the economy. Changes in the efficiency with which factors of production work is another source of productivity change and hence causes real GDP changes. Through productivity change, same factors produce more output. \nDue to this, growth rate in nominal GDP tends to overstate (exaggerate) changes in \nmacroeconomic performance when the economy suffers from a higher inflation rate.  The growth rate of the real GDP is the most common and better indicator of changes in macroeconomic performance over time."

Firstly, \nthe GDP deflator measures the price of both consumer and producer goods which are produced in the economy, whereas CPI measures the prices of goods and services that are bought by consumers only. Thus, an increase in the price of goods bought by firms or the government will show up in the GDP deflator but not in the CPI.

What did you observe and why?\nHouseholds decide how much to spend on goods and services and save depending on \ntheir income after tax. Income that is left in the hand of consumers after tax is deducted is \ncalled \ndisposable income . It is calculated as gross income (Y) minus personal taxes (T).  \nThis is the amount of income that determines household consumption. The consumption spending of individuals depends on their real personal disposable income\n()YT−. \nNote \ndY YT= − . where Y is gross income, T is personal income tax, and Yd is the \ndisposable income .\nThe relationship between consumption and disposable income is summarized in John Maynard Keynes’s General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money , which was \npublished in 1936. Keynes made the consumption function central to his theory of economic fluctuations, and it has played a key role in macroeconomic analysis ever since. For Keynes, there is a non-linear positive relationship between consumption spending and disposable income.  Households save a greater proportion of their income if their real income increases more than the increase in consumption.  But for simplicity let us assume a linear relationship between consumption and disposable income. Linear relationship means that the rate of change in consumption as income changes remains the same or is constant.\nIn general, consumption is directly related to disposable income and is positive even at \nzero disposable income. \nHence, it is given as:\n0d C C cY ,  &  0 c 1                     = + <<\nwhere Yd is the disposable income and C0 is the minimum consumption that a household \nneeds to survive at zero income.

APC is the ratio of the total consumption expenditure (C) to the total income (Y\nd) at a given level of income in an economy. It is a measure of \ntendency to consume income on average. \nHence, APC can be calculated as:\ndCAPCY= .\nIf a consumer has 4000 ETB and makes consumption expenditure of ETB 3000, the APC for this household will be:\ndC 3000APC 0.75Y 4000= = = .

We can aggregate the household consumption expenditure to generate national consumption expenditure. Generally speaking, consumption expenditure is a macroeconomic variable and it is crucial to any economy’s performance. There are at least six main determinants of consumption.\nThe major determinants of consumption expenditure at individual and national levels are: \n\t\nMoney income :  income  is the primary determinant of consumption. An increase in \nincome results in an increase of consumption expenditure. When income decreases, \nconsumption expenditure tends to decrease too.\n\tDistribution of income : consumption expenditure per unit of income is more for poor \npeople than the rich people. \n\tLevel of direct taxes : a higher level of direct taxes leads to a lower level of personal \ndisposable income, and thus to a decrease in consumption expenditure. This principle \nalso acts inversely. \n\tExpectation about future income and prices : if prices and incomes are expected \nto rise in the future, present consumption will increase. When people expect a fall in either income or prices, they tend to lower current consumption.\n\t\nRate of interest : increases in the rate of interest leads to a reduction of consumption \nexpenditure and an increase in saving. This is true because interest rate acts as cost of holding money outside banks and financial institutions. This principle also acts inversely. \n\t\nLevel of wealth : A higher wealth level leads to higher consumption expenditure .

An iqub is a form of revolving savings and is an example of informal financing. The origin of iqub is associated with the ancient customary practices such as community-level labour exchange arrangements and existed before \nthe emergence of the modern banking system in the country (Aredo, 1993).  It is based on pre-established social ties.It is very common among people who are in small-scale to medium-scale businesses who need additional finance to either expand their business or settle temporary financial problems. The iqub has a management established for administering the funds (a chairperson and a secretary), sometimes with special privilege of taking the first collected money and an implicit agreement to provide seating arrangements and other facilities. Members of an iqub agree to contribute a fixed amount of money periodically. The frequency is determined by the members. Each time the members meet, the iqub management decides on who should take the money, usually by lottery method and sometimes based on urgency of the need for cash. A member who needs the money urgently may be given a privilege.  Historically, people who did not have collateral to borrow from banks and other formal financial institutions used this type of arrangement. It is also a means of supporting friends and families who are struggling in business due to financial problems."

Sometimes one person, a person in need of finance, takes the initiative to begin a new iqub. The duration of the iqub depends on the number of members and the frequency of \nsaving. The most common frequencies are daily, weekly, bi-monthly and monthly. Accordingly, an iqub may last from a couple of weeks to 1 to 2 years. An existing iqub will end when all members get the chance to take the collected sum. At this point, a new iqub may be arranged in a different place or the next round of the same iqub may commence. The mechanism of iqub is like the group loan in banks. Every member will name \na guarantor, usually any member, who agrees to pay if the person is unable to contribute the required money.

In an economic \noutlook, an investment is the purchase of goods that are not consumed today, but are used \nin the future to generate wealth. In a strict sense, investment should lead to an increase in \nstock of capital, finished goods or raw materials. \n4.4.1 Investment Types\nThere are different ways of categorizing investment. It can be divided into two as induced \nand autonomous. Sometimes we divide investment as private and public investment depending on who makes the investment. \nGross Investment and Net Investment \nGross investment or gross capital investment is a company’s capital investment before deducting depreciation. Gross investment is the total amount that the economy spends on new capital. This figure includes an estimate for the value of capital depreciation since some investment is needed each year just to replace the used-up or worn-out plant and machinery.\nNote \n )The value of a piece of equipment decreases as we use it in the production process and this is called \ndepreciation of capital. Any investment that is \nmade for the purpose of compensating for such depreciation which is caused by production in a current year is not real investment; rather, it is what is sometimes known as \nreplacement investment .\nNet investment is the gross investment minus the depreciation on the existing capital.\n     Net investment Gross investment Depreciation = −\nIf gross investment is higher than depreciation, then net investment will be positive. A positive net investment increases the productive capacity of the economy .\nAutonomous Investment \nAutonomous investment is the expenditure on capital formation, which is independent of the change in income, rate of interest or rate of profit.

Generally, government makes autonomous investment because \nof the welfare consideration.\nInduced Investment \nInduced investment is investment which is made with the motive of earning a profit or income. This kind of investment depends directly upon profit expectations. It is income-elastic. Factors like prices, wages and interest changes which affect profits influence induced investment.\nIf national income goes up, induced investment also goes up – an increase in income induces \ninvestment. This occurs because an increase in national income leads to an increase in the demand for goods and services, which increases investor interest in meeting that demand, and therefore leads to investment. Thus, we can say that induced investment takes place when levels of income and demand in the economy go up. \nThe Investment Functions \nAs discussed above, induced investment is a positive function of income. Figure 4.6  \npresents the graphs of autonomous and induced investments. \nThe autonomous investment is a horizontal line and is independent of the income or profit \nlevel. The induced investment varies directly with profit or income. When income rises, more investment projects are profitable and hence more investment. \nPanel (a)  of Figure 4.6  \nshows the nature of induced investment while panel (b)  shows the graph of autonomous \ninvestment."

The origin of public investment is associated with the need to provide certain goods, infrastructure or services that are deemed to be of vital national interest and cannot be provided by the private sector.  Examples include investment to provide police services and national defense, supply of electricity, clean water, and sewage services, etc.\nPublic investment can be divided into three broad classes: physical investment, human \ninvestment, and consumption investment. Physical investment refers to tangible investment in infrastructure (for example, transport, telecommunications and buildings) while human or intangible investment is on education, skills, and knowledge. Consumption investment \nrefers to investment in consumption of goods and services (for example,  social security \nbenefits and  pensions).\nToday, there is a growing pressure on governments to reduce their public investment in areas where the private sector can operate. There is a growing demand for privatization of state-owned industries and deregulation of markets. Now, governments spend more money on goods and services which are provided by the private and not-for-profit sectors through the development of various public-private partnerships.\nInterest rates\nNote \n )There are two types of interest rates that affect profitability of investment \nand hence income. These are nominal interest rate and real interest rate .\nNominal interest rate refers to the interest rate before taking inflation into account. Hence, \nit is not corrected for inflation. Nominal interest rates are the interest rate that the bank pays. Almost all the interest rates that are reported in the newspaper are nominal rates."

To calculate the real interest rate, we subtract the actual or expected rate of inflation from the nominal interest rate.\nIf i denotes the nominal interest rate, r the real interest rate, and \n the rate of inflation, \nthen the relationship among these three variables can be written as \n . The real \ninterest rate is the difference between the nominal interest rate and the rate of inflation. \nFor example, if the nominal interest rate is 15% and the inflation is 8%, the real interest rate is 7%. If you save your money in a bank, you will receive the nominal interest rate but because of the inflation, the real gain is the amount of the real interest rate (in this case 7%). \nNote \n )Real interest rate equals to nominal interest rate minus inflation.\n4.4.2 Determinants of Investment \nAs outlined below, investment depends on interest rate, income, expectations about \nfuture sales and business taxes. \n•\tAs the interest rate rises, the cost of a given investment project rises and businesses invest less. Interest rate measures the cost of borrowed funds used to finance investment funds. Thus, if interest rate increases, the cost of investment increases. Due to this, the investment becomes less profitable and these would cause decline in the quantity of investment demand.\n•\tBusinesses invest because they expect to sell the goods they produce. If businesses become optimistic about future sales, investment spending grows and aggregate demand increases. If businesses become pessimistic about future sales, investment spending contracts and aggregate demand decreases.\n•\tBusinesses naturally consider expected after-tax profits when making their investment decisions. An increase in business taxes lowers expected profitability. With less profit expected, businesses invest less. As investment spending declines, aggregate demand declines. A decrease in business taxes, on the other hand, raises expected profitability and investment spending."

The reason is that an \nincrease in national income leads to an increase in the demand for goods and services and in investors’ interest in supplying them, which leads to increased investment.\nFurthermore, there are other factors which affect the performance of existing investments. \nThe Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (CSA) and the World Bank (WB) collect information on the main challenges that firms face. These factors are most often reported as key challenges that affect the performance of firms.   The main factors include: \n\tlack of infrastructure such as access to electricity, road, land, water and \ncommunication \n\taccess to finance \trules and regulations such as tax rules, customs duties and other procedures \tlack of raw materials \tpractices of the informal sector\tlack of market for output\nThe World Bank encourages countries to solve these and other related challenges to improve the business environment for firms.

Investment means expenditure on capital spending such as machineries and equipments. Investment influences the rate of economic growth because it is a component of aggregate (total) demand (AD) in the economy and more importantly influences the productive capacity of the economy. Hence, investment boosts economic activities.\nInvestment adds to the stock of capital, and the quantity of capital available to an economy \nis a crucial determinant of its productivity. Investment thus, contributes to economic growth.\nInvestment changes the capital stock. Capital investment refers to a company’s acquisition \nof assets such as real estate, manufacturing plant, machinery, computers, vehicles and production equipment. Capital investments are long-term investments and they allow companies to generate revenue for many years by adding or improving production facilities and boosting operational efficiency. \nA business does not see an immediate increase in revenue when it makes investments in \ncapital goods. Changes in the capital stock shift the production possibilities curve and the economy’s aggregate production function.\nStart-up Activity\n1. Is consumption spending good or bad for the economy? \n2.

This is generally incorrect because an appropriate level and combination of consumption spending creates demand for producers. According to the accelerator theory, such rises in demand for goods and services will trigger a rise in demand for investment. \nDefinition\nAccelerator theory  states that capital investment outlay is a function of \noutput.\nIf a firm operates in an industry where demand is rising and there is excess demand for the goods in the market, the firm is expected to respond to this situation.  Firms that are operating in this industry respond to this growth in demand in different ways, which may include expansion of production and full utilization of the existing capacity to produce. Some companies also meet such increase in demand by selling their existing inventory .\nAlternatively, a company in an industry may respond to the sustained rise in demand for its product by investing more in capital goods, equipment and technology with the aim of increasing its production capacity. In this case, the firm increases its investment spending. This enables the firm to meet the growing demand and narrow the gap between demand and supply. \nThus, demand for capital goods (investment) is driven by a change in demand for products \nbeing supplied by the company. This triggers the accelerator effect, which states that when there is a change in demand for consumer goods (an increase or decrease), there will be a higher percentage change in demand for capital goods.\nOverall, this relationship says that when consumption spending increases, demand also \nincreases and this in turn will lead to an increase in investment demand. The accelerator effect happens when an increase in national income (GDP) results in a proportionately larger rise in capital investment spending.\nLet \ntY be the level of output or gross domestic product (GDP), in time period t Let tK be \nthe capital stock available in period t and tI the level of investment in period t.

This means that changes in demand or income accelerates investment.  \nUnit Summary and Review Questions \nUnit Summary\nDisposable income is the amount of income that determines household consumption. The average propensity to consume (APC) is the ratio of total consumption expenditure (C) to total income (Yd) at a given level of income in an economy. The marginal propensity \nto consume (MPC) shows that the rate of change in household’s tendency to consume from the change in income. \nAverage propensity to save  is the ratio of total savings (S) to the total income (Y).  \nMarginal propensity to save (MPS)  is the ratio of the change in saving to the change \nin disposable income. The sum of average propensity to save and average propensity \nto consume equals to 1 (unity). The sum of marginal propensity to save and marginal propensity to consume equals to 1(unity).\nInvestment varies inversely with real interest rate. This relationship holds because the \ninterest rate represents the cost of borrowing money from banks and other financial institutions to the investor.  Real interest rate  equals nominal interest rate  minus \ninflation. The accelerator theory argues that investment spending in an economy is \nrelated to demand for goods and services."

International trade \nrefers to the exchange of goods and services between two or more countries. \nDomestic trade and international trade are quite different. First, movement of goods \nand services from one nation to another are subjected to different commercial policies (tariffs, quotas, etc) whereas there is almost nothing that governs movement of goods and services from one place (region) to another in one nation. Second, factor inputs such as labor and capital move freely within a country, but not between different countries. Moreover, international trade is governed by different national policies, political units, and monetary systems. Hence, it is necessary to treat international trade as a separate subject.\nBoth domestic and international trade plays an important role in the modern economy. \nIn this unit, we will study the potential role and gains from trade. We will also study both domestic and international trade theories. Moreover, we will identify the reasons for and effects of different trade and commercial polices that govern the movement of goods, services and factors of production among nations.\nInternational trade is administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which \nwas created on 1 January 1995. Prior to the creation of WTO, there was an arrangement called the “General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)” which was the basis for countries to engage in international trade. From 1948 to 1994, the GATT provided the rules for much of world trade. Today, WTO is the only global international organization"

Why do you think that nations trade with each other? Answer this first individually. Then compare your answer with the student next to you, and finally, report what you have understood to the class.\nDomestic trade refers to the exchange of goods or services within an individual country \nor territory. It is sometimes called “local trade” or “internal trade”. Under domestic trade, the market is constrained by the borders of that country and all the products must be bought and sold by people who live within the domestic market.\nDomestic trade can be further divided into retail trade and wholesale trade. Retail trade \ninvolves selling goods and services for direct consumption while wholesale trade involves agents other than a standard consumer. Wholesale trade is the backbone of the domestic market. A retailer is normally the final seller of a product. A retailor makes its purchases from wholesalers and sales are made to the customers directly. Retailers have a credit arrangement with wholesalers to buy the goods and can repay after their sales are made in cash. Retailers sell goods in small quantities relative to wholesale trade and are distributed all over the country where consumers live.\nWhy do we need to engage in domestic trade?\nHistorically, countries used to rely on domestic trade only due to lack of skills, transportation, information, etc. Domestic trade plays a crucial role in the economic growth of a country. By allowing different types of goods and services to reach all parts of the country, it improves the standard of living of the residents of the country as well as the employment rate of the country. Hence, domestic trade improves the economic performance of a country by improving resource distribution and efficiency.  For example, under capitalism, domestic trade develops due to private ownership of the means of production."

Political issues, international disagreements and wars have less effect on the economy when a country has a strong domestic trade. Under such situations, countries with few manufacturing plants are likely to struggle during wartime, since they have difficulty obtaining goods, services and equipment.\nNote \n )Domestic trade improves economic performance of a country by improving \nresource distribution and efficiency.\nDomestic trade has several benefits over international trade, some of which are discussed here. First, transaction costs which are associated with making sales tend to be much lower \nfor domestic markets due to a lack of  tariffs and customs duties. Second, transportation \ncosts are also much lower, and goods can be put on the market more quickly as they have a shorter distance to travel. Through development of domestic trade, a country will be able to keep money within a country, which can be used to finance future growth of the economy both in the long run and the short run.\nThe biggest problem and limitation of domestic trade is the limit to the selection of \nproducts which are available for sale. In a pure domestic trade market, countries only trade what they have managed to produce, and some countries have limited capacity and resources to meet their demand. Hence, countries may not meet the demand of their people by relying only on their domestic trade patterns. This is why today, all countries engage in international trade and would like to benefit from international specializations and differences in endowments. \n Activity 5.1\n1.

There are different reasons for the difference in the prices of a commodity among nations which may include differences in resource endowments, the level of technology and technical skills or know-how. \nFor instance, Ethiopia imports computers from abroad because the country lacks the \ntechnology of production, capital and know-how that are necessary for computer production. The implication of this is that if Ethiopia tries to produce these goods domestically, the economy faces high production costs leading to high domestic prices relative to international prices for computers.  This motivates domestic residents to prefer foreign computers. Hence, it is worthwhile for the country to import computers cheaply from abroad rather than producing them domestically at a higher cost. Moreover, nature has distributed resources unevenly in the world which makes production of some goods in some countries impossible. \nThus, international trade has enabled the countries in the world to consume those goods \nand services which they themselves could not produce.

They also appeared in other countries such as Spain, France, \nPortugal and the Netherlands. They were concerned with the process of nation building, i.e. how to make a given nation powerful economically and politically. They wrote essays on international trade that advocated an economic philosophy known as “mercantilism”. \nThe underlying view of the mercantilists was the belief that a country’s wealth is based \non the holdings of precious metals like gold. Such revenues would contribute to increased spending and a rise in domestic output and employment.  According to them, for a nation to be powerful economically and politically, the nation should accumulate as much gold \nand precious metals as possible which were used as the medium of exchange at that time.\nTo accumulate large amount of gold and precious metals, a country should export more \nthan its imports. Exports were considered good because they generate revenue to the exporting nation, but imports were considered bad since they imply payments to other countries. Increasing export would enable a country to obtain a large amount of gold and precious metals; whereas decreasing imports would prevent the country’s holdings of gold and precious metals being depleted. \nThus, if a country could achieve a favorable trade balance (a surplus of exports over \nimports), it would enjoy payments that are received from the rest of the world in the form of precious metals, primarily gold and silver. Such surplus receipts contribute to a rise in domestic output and employment.\nTo promote a favorable trade balance, the mercantilists advocated government regulation \nof trade. They advocated the imposition of tariffs, quotas and other commercial policies to minimize imports to protect a nation’s trade position. This situation implied that international trade was a zero-sum game, in which one country’s economic gain was achieved at the expense of another.  \nThe idea of the mercantilists was refuted by some groups of thinkers called the classical \nthinkers, who perceived that a nation’s wealth is reflected in its productive capacity ( i.e. its ability to produce final goods and services), and not in its holdings of precious metals.\nThe static (not changing over time) view of the world economy by the Mercantilists \nwas also later criticized. Adam Smith advocated a dynamic view of the world economy, which suggested that both trading partners could simultaneously enjoy higher levels of consumption and production with free trade."

Today, there are public officials who argue that exports are “good” because they create jobs in a country, and imports are “not good” as they take jobs from the same country.

This is roughly the period from the 1760s –the 1850s.  Adam Smith and David Ricardo were among the principal advocates of this economic thought. Classical economic theory was essentially about growth and development of a country. They wanted to investigate the nature and causes of the wealth of nations and the distribution of the national product among the factors of production. \nAdam Smith’s Principle of Absolute Advantage \nAdam Smith (1723-1790) was a Scottish philosopher and an economist, educated at the Universities of Glasgow and Oxford and subsequently a Professor of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow University. He was a leading advocate of free trade on the grounds that it promotes the international division of labor. \nIn 1776, Adam Smith published his famous book, “An Inquiry into the Nature and \nCauses of the Wealth of Nations ”, in which he attacked the mercantilist view on trade and \nadvocated free trade as the best policy for all nations. According to Smith, trade between \ntwo nations is based on absolute advantage.\n To explain the concept of absolute advantage,"

He argued that a tailor does not make his own shoes but exchanges \na suit for shoes from a shoemaker. Through exchange, both the shoemaker and the tailor gain. In the same manner, a country could gain by trading with other countries. \nAccording to Smith, nations could benefit from international exchange of goods by \nconcentrating on the production of goods that they could make most cheaply. He advocated a laissez faire\n (pronounced “lay-zay fair”) approach to economic systems which argue \nthat economic affairs of society are best guided by the decisions of individuals. Laissez faire is French for “let people do as they choose” or “allow to do”.\nSmith advocated a policy of laissez faire , which allows individuals to pursue their own \nactivities within the bounds of law and order and respect for property rights. The proper \nrole of the government was to see that the market was free to function by removing the barriers to effective operation of the market.\nNote \n )A laissez faire approach to economic systems argues that economic affairs \nof society are best guided by the decisions of individuals.\nIn other words, he argued that mutually beneficial trade can be achieved based on what he referred to as “\nabsolute advantage ”. This is sometimes called  “absolute cost advantage”.  \nThe absolute cost advantage is the ability of one country to produce one of the two goods at a lower cost relative to its trading partner\n. For example, Ethiopia produces coffee at a \nlower cost and sells it to many European countries, hence, Ethiopia has absolute advantage in the production of coffee. On the other hand, European countries, such as Germany and France, have an absolute advantage in the production of processed goods such as machines and perfumes. We say Ethiopia has absolute cost disadvantage in the production of these \nitems, and hence needs to import them from countries with absolute advantage.\nSmith argued that trade is mutually beneficial, and it is a positive-sum game, but not a zero-\nsum relationship as assumed by the mercantilists. He presented a powerful argument for expanding trade and reducing the many trade controls that characterized the mercantilist period. The view of Adam Smith and his colleagues about international trade is called “classical thoughts”."

Let us assume trade between Ethiopia and China of \ncoffee and cloth production. For simplicity, assume that each country is endowed with    2 units of labor only. \nEthiopia has an absolute advantage in the production of coffee while China has an absolute \nadvantage in the production of cloth. The absolute advantage is indicated by difference in productivity. To put the example clearly, Ethiopia produces 4 kgs of coffee as opposed to the 1 kg of coffee per labor hour in China. Hence, Ethiopia is more effective in coffee production and has an absolute cost advantage. Regarding the cloth production, China is more productive since one laborer hour produces 5 yards of cloth as opposed to 2 yards in Ethiopia. The total output before trade is 5 kgs of coffee and 7 yards of cloth. This situation is sometimes called “autarky”.\nNote \n )Autarky  is a situation where there is no international trade and a country is \nassumed to be self-sufficient.\nAssume that the two countries will completely specialize in the production of a good in which they have absolute advantage. As indicated in \nTable 5.1  Ethiopia will move all    its \nresources towards the production of coffee and China will produce only clothes.  With 2 \nunits of labor, Ethiopia will produce 8kgs of coffee and China will produce 10 yards of \ncloth. Before trade, total world production is 5kgs of coffee and 7 yards of cloth, if the two \ncountries use 1 labor to produce each good. \nNow, let us introduce international trade. Assume that the two countries want to trade some \nof the excess amount of the goods they have produced through specialization. Assume also \nthat the rate of exchange is 1 kg of coffee for 1 yard of cloth (1:1) for simplicity and they \nwant to exchange 4 units of the goods. From this, we can understand that Ethiopia sales 4 \nunits of coffee and would receive 4 units of cloth in return. \nAfter trade, consumption equals to 4kgs of coffee and 4 yards of cloth in Ethiopia and 4kgs \nof coffee and 6 yards of cloth in China. In this way, the total gains due to specialization and \ntrade is 2kgs of coffee and 4 yards of cloth. The lion share of the gains from trade goes to \nChina and this is due to productivity difference and the assumed terms of trade or rate of \nexchange. This example can be taken as a proof showing that both countries could benefit \nfrom trade and, thus trade is not a zero-sum game."

There are at least two major \nweaknesses in Smith’s analysis of international trade. First, the initial assumptions that labor is the only factor of production and that it is homogeneous could be challenged. Labor may not be the only factor of production and it is not of the same quality in the two countries. However, it should be underlined that rejecting the assumptions does not necessarily imply rejecting the law of absolute advantage. Second, Smith’s concept of absolute advantage explains only a small part of the world trade, such as those between developed and developing countries. Most of the world trade, especially trade among developed countries, cannot be explained by absolute advantage. \nFinally, the principle of absolute advantage does not show what will happen if one country \nhas an absolute advantage in the production of both goods.  This task was left to David Ricardo, a British economist, who formulated the principle of comparative advantage, \nsometimes referred to as the principle of comparative costs .\nDavid Ricardo’s Principle of Comparative Advantage\nDavid Ricardo (1772–1823) was a British Economist who is best remembered for his theories of Rent and comparative cost .

He is credited for formalizing the \nconcept of comparative advantage . \nThe original idea of comparative advantage dates to the early part of the nineteenth \ncentury. David Ricardo formalized the idea by using a simple numerical example in his 1817 book entitled, The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. In what follows, \nthe assumptions of Ricardo’s model and the definition of comparative advantage are presented. This is followed by numerical example for illustration.\nThe following are the assumptions of Ricardo’s law of comparative advantage:\n\tThere are two-countries, two goods, and labor as the only factor of production.\n\tThe goods are homogeneous (identical) across firms and countries, and labor \nis homogeneous within a country but heterogeneous (non-identical) across countries.\n\tThe factor of production is mobile between alternative uses and within a country, but immobile internationally.\n\tThe labor theory of value is employed, i.e. the cost of a good is determined by the amount of labor used to produce.\n\tThe level of technology is fixed with constant costs of production.\n\tThere is full employment.\n\tThe economy is characterized by perfect competition and free trade.\n\tThere are no government-imposed obstacles to economic activity, and\n\tTransportation costs are zero. \nAccording to Ricardo’s principle of comparative advantage, even if a nation is more efficient (that is, has an absolute advantage) than another nation in the production of both goods, there is still a basis for mutually beneficial trade. The more efficient nation should specialize in the production and export of the goods in which its absolute advantage is greater and import the goods in which its absolute advantage is smaller. Similarly, the less efficient nation should specialize in the production and export of the goods in which its absolute disadvantage is smaller and import the goods in which its absolute disadvantage is greater."

Furthermore, he introduced the concept of \nopportunity cost , which is defined as the next best alternative \nforgone. For our purpose, let us assume two countries (Ethiopia and Germany) producing automobiles and wine. \nTable 5.2  illustrates Ricardo’s law of comparative advantage. The \nnumbers in the table are numbers of labor hours which are required to produce one unit of the good. \nAs can be observed from Table 5.2 , in Ethiopia, it takes 100 hours of labor to produce 1 \nunit of automobile, while it takes 80 hours of labor to produce 1 unit of wine. In Germany, it takes 40 hours of labor to produce 1 unit of automobile, while it takes  60 hours of labor to produce 1 unit of wine. Thus, according to this example, Germany has an absolute advantage (that is, uses fewer labor hours) in the production of both goods. From Adam Smith’s perspective, there is no basis for trade because Germany is more efficient in the production of both goods, and Ethiopia has an absolute disadvantage in both goods. \nBased on the comparative advantage of Ricardo, however, we can see that Germany is \nrelatively more efficient in the production of automobiles than of wine and that Ethiopia’s relative disadvantage is smaller in the production of wine. In other words, automobile production is relatively cheaper (or wine production is relatively more expensive) in Germany.\nThis situation is illustrated by using the concept of opportunity cost (relative cost) \nas indicated in \nTable 5.3  below, which is derived from Table 5.2 .

Similarly, the opportunity cost of wine production is defined as number of units of automobiles that must be given up in order to produce one more unit of wine.\nNote \n)\tThe opportunity cost of wine production is defined as the number \nof units of automobiles that must be given up in order to produce \none more unit of wine.\nTable 5.3  shows that in Ethiopia, 1 unit of automobile is equivalent to 1.25 units of \nwine, while 1 unit of wine is equivalent to 0.8 units of automobile. On the other hand, in Germany, 1 unit of automobile is equivalent to 0.67 units of wine, while 1 unit of wine is equivalent to 1.5 units of automobile. \nTherefore, Ethiopia has a comparative advantage in the production of wine as the \nopportunity cost of wine in terms of automobiles is lower in Ethiopia (as indicated by the single asterisk in \nTable 5.3  above). \nSimilarly, Germany has a comparative advantage in the production of automobiles, as the opportunity cost of automobile in terms of wine is lower in Germany (as indicated by the double asterisk in \nTable 5.3  above).

Another \ndrawback of Ricardo’s theory is the assumption of constant returns to scale and thus, constant cost of production in both nations.\n5.4 Balance of Payment Components \nAfter completing this section, you will be able to: \n\tdefine “balance of payment”\n\tdifferentiate between current account balance and capital account balance\nStart-up Activity\nWhat do you think about balance of payment from your point of view? Why is it important?

The third activity is capital transfers, which are concerned with financial receipts and payments.\nThese transactions are recorded in what is called the “balance of payment (BoP)” of a \ncountry. The balance of payments record of a country is a systematic record of all economic transactions of a country with the rest of the world during a given period of time. It is a double entry system of record of all economic transactions between the residents of the country and the rest of the world that is carried out in a specific period of time.\nAny transaction in BoP involves debit and credit items.

These credit items are recorded with a plus sign. \nOn the other hand, debit items in the balance of payment accounts reflect transactions \nthat give rises to payment outward from the home country. The main items are imports, investments made in foreign countries by domestic nationals and payments of interest and dividends by the home country on earlier investments which are made by foreign investors. By convention, debit items (which lead to a payment of outflow) are recorded with a minus sign.\nThe BoP of a given country is one of the most important economic indicators which are \nused by policy makers to predict the effect of international conditions on the domestic economy. It shows that how many goods and services that the country has been exporting, importing and whether a country has been borrowing from or lending to the rest of the world.\nThere are two main accounts in the balance of payment: the current account and the \ncapital account and each of them can be further subdivided into other sub accounts. The \ncapital account is sometimes called the “financial account”.\n5.4.1 The Current Account (CA)\nThe current account includes transactions in goods, services, investment incomes, and current transfers. The current account\n records inflows and outflows of foreign currency \nresulting from flows of goods, flows of services and unrequited (or unilateral) transfers. It is composed of three balances: trade balance, net services  and net transfers.\nTrade balance : shows that the balance in the trading of merchandise goods by excluding \ntrade in services. Hence, it is narrower than the current account. Trade balance shows that balance of export and import of goods by excluding current transfer income and trade in services. The implication is that;\n)\tWhen the value of exports is more than that of imports, the country is said to have a trade surplus or favorable (or positive) foreign trade. \n)\tWhen import values are more than export values, the country is said to have a trade deficit, i.e. unfavorable (or negative) foreign trade. \n)\tWhen the value of exports equals the value of imports, we call it a trade balance."

What do you think is the status of the trade balance and current account \nbalance of Ethiopia over the past couple of years?\n2. Do you expect the trade balance to be in deficit or surplus? Why?\nNet services : the difference between the export and import of services is called “net \nservices”. There are many services that are made use of in international trade, for example, shipping, insurance and banking services. Ships must be hired for transporting goods from one country to another. The merchandise which is carried by the ships has to be insured for any loss and damage in transit. Banking services are used to facilitate receipts from and payments to foreign dealers. The net receipt of such services is recorded as net services in BoP.\nNet transfers : transactions such as gifts, remittances, donations, etc., are unrequited or \nunilateral receipts and payments, because residents of a country receive them ‘for free’. This is to say that nothing has to be paid in return, either at present or in the future, for such receipts. The difference between the receipts and payments of such transfers is known as “net transfers”. Hence, current account balance is the sum of trade balance, net services and net transfers during a given period of time. \n5.4.2 The Capital Account (KA)\nThe capital account, broadly defined, includes transactions in financial instruments and central bank reserves. The capital account records transactions concerning the movement of financial capital into and out of a country. Capital comes into a country by borrowing, sales of overseas’ assets and investments in a country by foreigners. These items are said to be capital inflow and recorded as credit items while capital that leaves the country due to lending, buying of overseas’ assets and purchases of domestic assets which are owned by foreigner residents. These items represent capital outflow and are recorded as debit. The balance on capital account measures the outflow and inflow of funds’ purchase and"

It may be positive (surplus) or negative (deficit). \nOverall balance of payment (BoP), therefore, is the sum of current account balance (CA) \nand capital account balance (KA). \nCA KA BoP+=\nWhen a country is in current account deficit, it must pay the differences between imports and exports from a surplus in the capital account surplus. If there is no surplus or the surplus in the capital account is not enough to cover the deficit in the current account, the country will pay the difference from the official reserve accounts. The country needs to settle its bills. This is why countries enter into a situation where they have to restrict or control international trade flows. \nBalance of Payment Statement \nBy adding the balance on the capital account and the balance on the current account, we get the complete balance of the payments account. When receipts and payments are equal, the balance of payments is said to be in balance. If the total BoP receipts are more than the payments, the excess goes to a third account, the Foreign Exchange Reserves. In addition \nto this, when payments exceed receipts, there is a depletion of foreign exchange reserves."

When the interventions aim to discourage international trade, the policies are “restrictive policies”. Trade restriction is a policy that is introduced by countries on the trade of goods and/or services between two or more countries to limit the volume of trade and associated transactions. There are two broad measures which are used to restrict trade flows. Trade restrictions are imposed on foreign trade, particularly on imports. \nTrade restrictions are broadly of two types as price related and quantity related restrictions. \nImposition of a tariff is an example of price restriction while import quota is an example of quantity restriction. \nTariff restrictions : are in the form of taxes on the import of goods, called “custom duty” or \n“import duty”. Such taxes raise the price of imported goods in the domestic market. These high prices of imported goods are expected to reduce their demand in the domestic market and thus, to act to restrict imports. Note that tariff increase government revenue. \nQuantitative restriction (Import quota ): these restrictions take the shape of fixing the \nmaximum quantity of goods that are permitted to be imported. Thus, the government may determine the total import quota of goods, i.e. the total amount of goods that can be"

This naturally limits the quantity of imports.\nReason for trade restrictions\nThere are several reasons for restricting trade including:\n\tto protect domestic jobs (job protection argument)\tto protect small and infant industries (infant industry argument)\tto maintain the domestic standard of living\tto equalize production costs\tfor the purpose of national security\tfor cultural and sociological considerations\nFurthermore, there are two broad trade strategies that countries use to enhance macroeconomic performances. These are import substitution (IS)  strategy and export \npromotion (EP) strategy. Import substitution strategy aims to replace imported items by \ndomestic products through special support packages to promote domestic producers. The idea of import substituting industrialization was a popular strategy in many developing countries over the period from the early 20\nth century until the late 1970s. This strategy \nwas born due to lack of access to imports or shortage of foreign currencies to pay for them.  Import substitution strategy has at least two important effects. The first is that infant or young industries are protected from competing with cheap imports via tariff barriers, various quantitative restrictions and other measures. Second, the tariffs on imports help to increase government revenue. \nNote \n )Import substitution  is a trade and economic policy that advocates replacing \nimports with domestic production.\nThere are alternative ways of defining export promotion (EP) strategy which gives preferential treatment to the export sector to generate revenue in foreign currency.  This entails providing incentives over and above those which would prevail in a neutral strategy. \nNote \n )Export promotion  refers to the act of policy measures which actually or \npotentially enhance exporting activity at the company, industry, or national \nlevel."

It is sometimes called “forex market” or “currency market”. This is a place where the trading of one currency for another takes place. This market determines foreign exchange rates for every currency. It is based on the interactions of demand and supply for currencies. \nThe demand for foreign currencies arises due to factors such as tourists visits to another \ncountry, import demand for goods from other nations and demand to invest abroad. The supply of a nation’s foreign currency arises from earnings such as from tourist expenditure, export earnings and foreign direct investment.\nExchange rate is simply the price of one currency in terms of another currency. There are \ntwo major systems of exchange rates. There are fixed exchange rate and flexible exchange rate systems. In this section, we will study each of them and differentiate between nominal and real exchange rates. \n5.6.1 Nominal and Real Exchange Rate.\nNominal exchange rate refers to the rate at which currency can be exchanged for another currency. The nominal exchange rate is the number of units of the domestic currency that can purchase a unit of a given foreign currency. There are two ways of expressing the exchange rate. We can express the price of one unit of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency or the price of one unit of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency.  For example, at the time of going to press, Ethiopia buys 1 USD for close to 45 ETB. That means the price of 1 USD is 45 ETB, so the exchange rate for USD is equal to 45 ETB. Hence, the nominal exchange rate is 45. Similarly, the exchange rate between European Euro and Ethiopian Birr is close to 53.\nNote \n )Nominal exchange rate is usually expressed as the domestic price of the \nforeign currency."

This is the amount of a USD used to buy one unit of ETB. Currently, 1ETB buys just 0.022 USD. In this way, the exchange rate equals to 0.022. In this subject and in most economic analysis, the first definition of exchange rate is used (i.e. price of one unit of a foreign currency as measured by the local currency). \nWhen a person buys a foreign currency, he/she is interested in what can be bought with \nthat currency. The real exchange rate tells us how many goods and services in the domestic \ncountry can be exchanged for the goods and services in a foreign country . \nDefinition of real exchange rate (RER) depends on the type of nominal exchange rate that \nwe use. We can use the foreign currency value or the domestic value per unit of foreign currency. For our discussions, let us use the domestic currency that is required to buy one unit of a foreign currency (i.e. 1 USD equals 45 ETB).\nUnder this assumption, \nthe real exchange rate is the ratio of the price level abroad \nand the domestic price level , where the foreign price level is converted into domestic \ncurrency units via the current nominal exchange rate . The real exchange rate between \ntwo currencies is the product of the nominal exchange rate and the ratio of prices between \nthe two countries.\nThe real exchange rate is represented by the following equation: \nForeign PriceReal exchange rate Nominal exchange rate*Domestic Price= \nOr symbolically , *pRER ep=\nWhere, in our example, e is the nominal ETB-USD exchange rate,  P*  is the average price \nof a good in the foreign market, and  P is the average price of the good in Ethiopia.\nThe real exchange rate tells us how many times more or less goods and services that can be \npurchased abroad (after conversion into a foreign currency) than in the domestic market for a given amount. As indicated above, the nominal exchange rate between ETB and USD is 45.  If the price of a burger is 60 Birr in Ethiopia and 5 USD in the USA, the real exchange rate will be:\n5   45ETB 1 Real exchange rate *60 1  1 USDUSD Burger\nETB USDEthiopian Burger\n="

This means that the same 5 USD would buy 2.25 extra units of burger in Ethiopia as opposed to the previous value of 3.75. \nNote \n )If the real exchange rate is 1, it costs the same amount of money to buy a \ngiven good in both countries.\nNow, let us consider how exchange rate is determined in a given economy.  There are two different methods of determining the price of foreign currency (exchange rate): fixed and \nflexible exchange rate system .\n5.6.2 Fixed Exchange Rate Systems\nA fixed exchange rate is a situation where the price of one currency in terms of another currency is fixed by a government or national bank. In a fixed exchange rate system, exchange rate is determined by the national bank of a country at the point where the demand for foreign currency equals its supply. This can be possible through intervening in the foreign exchange market by buying and selling of foreign currency accordingly. For this purpose, monetary authorities have to hold an inventory of foreign currency that can be supplied in exchange for domestic currency.\nUsing a fixed exchange rate system has some advantages which include stability of the \nvalue of local currency and provision of greater certainty for exporters and importers, and help, the government maintain low inflation.\nUnder a fixed exchange rate system, a change in exchange rate requires intervention by the \ngovernment or the central bank and we say that there is either devaluation or revaluation"

If we measure the exchange rate as the price of 1 unit of the foreign currency \nin terms of local currency, as we did above, devaluation refers to an increase in the foreign exchange rate while revaluation is the opposite.\nDevaluation of a local currency is generally expected to encourage export earnings and \ndiscourage imports. With devaluation, imports become expensive while exports become cheaper in the international market.  \n5.6.3 Floating Exchange Rate Systems\nA floating or flexible exchange rate is a regime where the price of the domestic currency is set by the foreign exchange market based on the interaction between supply and demand of the currencies.  Floating exchange rates is more common in the real world. A floating exchange rate does not mean that countries do not try to intervene. This is usually the case of managed floating where a government or central bank manipulates its currency’s price, in order to maintain a currency price which is favorable for international trade.\nNote \n )The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) closely follows the determination of \nthe exchange rate between Ethiopian Birr and other foreign currencies in \nEthiopia in line with the managed floating system.\nA change in the value of exchange rate under a flexible exchange rate regime constitutes appreciation  or depreciation. Given our definition of the exchange rate as the price of \n1 unit of the foreign currency, appreciation refers to a decrease in the foreign exchange rate while depreciation is the opposite. If the exchange rate between United States Dollar (USD) and Ethiopian Birr (ETB) increase from its  value of 45 to 50, we say that there is depreciation of ETB, if the exchange rate decreases to 30, for instance, we say the Birr has appreciated. \n5.7 Regional Integration and Globalization Practices in the Ethiopian \nContext \nAfter completing this section, you will be able to: \n\tdefine regional integration. \n\tdiscuss the advantages of regional integration.\n\tdistinguish between the different stages of regional integration."

What kind of regional integration you noticed in Ethiopia?\n2. Why do you think countries undergo regional integration?\nRegional integration is the process by which two or more countries agree to cooperate \nand work together to achieve peace, stability and wealth. Regional integration is an arrangement among countries to meet a pre-defined common goal. Integration aims to \nreduce costs for both consumers and producers  and to increase trade between the countries \nthat are involved  in the agreement. Regional integration is sometimes called “economic \nintegration”.\nThe regional agreement is based on one or more written agreements that describe the areas \nof cooperation in detail. There are different degrees of integration. The simplest being free \ntrade area and the final stage is political integration. \nNote \n )Regional integration, or economic integration, is an agreement among \nnations to reduce or eliminate trade barriers and agree on macroeconomic \npolicies.\n5.7.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Economic Integration\nEconomic integration will lead to three broad advantages for all member countries. These advantages include trade benefits, employment benefits, and improved political cooperation. It can reduce the costs of trade and hence, improve the availability of goods and services and increase consumer purchasing power in member nations. Concerning employment opportunities, economic integration tends to improve employment because \ntrade liberalization leads to market expansion, technology sharing, and cross-border \ninvestment.\nFinally, due to the stronger economic ties between member countries through integration, \nthere will be an incentive and a platform for political cooperation. Member countries are \nexpected to resolve conflicts peacefully that will lead to greater  stability in their region."

Despite its benefits, there are costs \nthat may fall into three categories:  trade diversion, reduced employment and reduced \nnational sovereignty.\n•\tTrade diversion refers to the possibility of shifting trade from an efficient non-members country to a less efficient member country. Due to the agreement, member countries might be forced or encouraged to trade with member countries although there might be non-member countries that can supply the good cheaper which induces inefficiency in the system. \n•\tFirms may relocate their business in cheaper countries due to the opening of borders. This may lead to loss of jobs and unemployment in the high-cost member countries. \n•\tIt also implies erosion of national sovereignty. Members of economic unions typically are required to adhere to rules on trade, monetary and fiscal policies which are established by the management of the economic union external to any nation. This sometimes creates inconsistencies with pressing national issues and goals.  \nThere are four main types of regional economic integrations with different levels of integration:\nFree trade area : this most basic form of economic cooperation in which member countries \nremove all barriers to trade between themselves. They are free to independently determine their own trade policies with non-member nations. An example is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nCustoms union : this form of regional integration builds on the agreement under free \ntrade area and restricts member countries to trade with non-member countries in a similar manner.

Like \ncustoms unions, in common market there is a common trade policy for trade with non-member nations. In this regional integration, the primary advantage to workers is that they no longer need a visa or work permit to work in another member country of a common market. An example is the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).\nEconomic union: this is final stage of economic integration. Under economic union, \ncountries enter into an economic agreement to remove barriers to trade and adopt common economic policies. An example is the European Union (EU).\nNote \n )There are four types of regional economic integrations with different levels \nof integration. These are free trade areas , customs unions , common \nmarkets  and economic unions .\n5.7.2 Globalization Practices in Ethiopian Context\nGlobalization refers to the increasing interdependence of world economies, population and cultures. The main drivers could be the growing scale of cross-border trade of commodities and services, the flow of international capital and the wide and rapid spread of technologies. Globalization reflects the increased interconnectedness and interdependence of peoples and countries.\nCountries may enjoy several benefits due to globalization. Some of these benefits include \naccess to new markets and technology, exposure to a new way of life and culture and an improved standard of living.\nGlobalization allows companies to find lower-cost ways to produce their products. It also \nincreases global competition, which drives prices down and creates a larger variety of choices for consumers. Lowered costs help people in both developing and developed countries to live better on less money.\nGlobalization can imply a substantial technological up-grading in developing countries \nthrough opening different channels. On the one hand, a developing country can implement embodied technological change (ETC) by purchasing secondhand capital goods from more industrialized countries. Similarly, a late starter developing country can enjoy the “last comer” benefit of jumping directly on a relatively new technology ."

It is divided into domestic and international trade. Domestic trade  refers to the exchange of goods or \nservices within an individual country or territory. Domestic trade can be further divided into retail trade and wholesale trade. Retail trade involves selling of goods and services \nfor direct consumption while wholesale trade  involves agents other than a standard \nconsumer. International trade  refers to the exchange of goods and services between two \nor more countries which is sometimes called “foreign trade”. \nThere are three basic theories that discuss the nature and role of international trade. These \nare the theories of mercantilists, Adam Smith and David Ricardo. The mercantilists \nbelieved that a country’s wealth is based on the holdings of precious metals like gold and they encourage exports and discourage imports. The absolute advantage theory of Adam \nSmith suggested that international trade is possible only when a country has absolute cost advantage in the production of at least one good. Later, Ricardo developed the theory of \ncomparative advantage. According to this principle, mutually beneficial trade between two countries could take place even if one country has an absolute cost advantage in the production of both goods.\nThe balance of payments of a country is a systematic record of all economic transactions \nof a country with the rest of the world during a given period.

Economic development implies both more output and changes in the technical and institutional arrangements by which it is produced and distributed. Economic development must therefore, be conceived of as a multidimensional process involving the major changes in social structures, popular attitudes, and national institutions, as well as the acceleration of economic growth, the reduction of inequality, and the eradication of poverty.

The gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of goods and services which are provided by a country over a period of time, often one year or one quarter. The GDP is calculated by estimating the gross output of goods and services by the country, and subtracting the intermediate consumption (the cost of materials and services used to produce the goods or services sold).  Growth is not indicated by the GDP itself, but rather growth is determined by the percentage in increase of the GDP from one time period to another.\n GDP growth = (GDP in current period - GDP in the previous period) / GDP in the previous \nperiod * 100. \n( ) ( ) GDP in current period Gt  GDP in the prev ious period (Gt 1)GDP growth * 100GDP in the previous period (Gt 1)−−=−\nEconomic growth rate typically refers to the increase in the inflation-adjusted market \nvalue of the goods and services that are produced by an economy over a specific period. It is conventionally measured in percentage terms since it is the easiest way to make a comparison over time and space.

Furthermore, economists often focus on the percentage change in the real GDP per capita because it improves the comparison between countries and also isolates the effect of changing the population."

In other words, it measures how efficiently production inputs, such as labor and capital, are being used in an economy to produce a given level of output. Productivity is considered to be a key source of economic growth and competitiveness and, as such, is basic statistical information for many international comparisons and country performance assessments. There are different measures of productivity and the choice between them depends either on the purpose of the productivity measurement and/or data availability. One of the most widely used measures of productivity is gross domestic product (GDP) per hour worked. This measure captures the use of labor inputs better than just output per employee.\nHigher productivity means producing more from a given amount of inputs or producing a \ngiven amount with fewer inputs.

The understanding and measurement of development has shifted from one dimension, i.e. income, to multiple dimensions, i.e. capabilities and freedoms. An increasing GDP is often seen as a measure of welfare and economic success. However, it fails to take into account for the multi-dimensional nature of development or the inherent short-comings of capitalism, which tends to concentrate income and, thus, power in the hands of few. One expanded indicator, which attempts to measure the multi-dimensional aspect of development, is the Human Development Index (HDI), conceived by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not only of rich, but also of"

HDI is important because it not only gives a better indication of well-being but also it is better than measuring income alone. It has been used in the Human Development Report which was published since 1989. The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite criterion consisting of three indicators of development to measure the level of welfare of the people of a country:\n\tLife expectancy indicators (LEI) – this refers to life expectancy at birth the number of years a newly born baby is expected to live. High life expectancy at birth indicates that a high level of development and vice versa.\n\tEducational attainments indicators (EAI) – this refers to the level of education which is attained by the people of the country on an average basis. The constituents of educational attainments are:\na. adult literacy rate\nb.  gross enrollment ratio\nAdult literacy measures the percentage of people aged 15 and over who can understand, read and writes a short and simple statement in their everyday life. The gross enrolment ratio shows the percentage of population enrolled at primary, secondary and university level.

Have you ever made a choice in economic matters in your family?\nThe capability approach was first articulated by the Indian economist and philosopher Amartya Sen in the 1980s, and remains most closely associated with him.  He argues that the “capability to function” is what really matters for status as a poor or non-poor person. As Sen put it, “Economic growth cannot be sensibly treated as an end in itself. Development has to be more concerned with enhancing the lives we lead and the freedoms we enjoy. That is, we should look at people’s capabilities: their abilities and possibilities to live a good life make choices about their education, economic activities, and their freedom to participate in decision making. Development has the role of strengthening autonomy and substantive freedoms, which allow individuals to fully participate in economic life. Hence, economic development occurs when individual agents have the opportunity to develop the capacities that allow them to actively engage and contribute to the economy."

The \ncapability approach goes directly to the quality of life that people can actually achieve. This quality of life is analyzed in terms of the central concepts of functioning and capability . \n“Capabilities” are what people can achieve if they so choose, such as being well-nourished, getting married, being educated, and travelling; “functioning” refers to the use that a person makes of the commodities at his/her command. Whether someone can convert a set of means to resources and public goods into a functioning (i.e. whether he/she has a particular capability) crucially depends on certain personal, sociopolitical, and environmental conditions, which, in capability literature, are called ‘conversion factors.’ Capabilities have also been referred to as “real” or “substantive freedoms” as they denote the freedoms that have been cleared of any potential obstacles, in contrast to mere formal rights and freedoms. Freedom is integral to Sen’s approach which distinguishes between people’s capabilities (what they can potentially be and do) and what they choose to do with them (their actual functioning). \nConsider that a rich and healthy person who, for religious reasons, fasts for a specified \nperiod thus temporarily reducing his calorie intake below that considered to be the basic need. Consider also a poor female farmer who does long hours of hard physical work in the fields for low payment and cannot afford to buy sufficient food for herself and her children. The rich man had the possibility of being well nourished and chose to fast whilst the poor women was so disadvantaged by the labor market that she had no options. Over the short term at least, the man’s daily calorie intake (his functioning of being well nourished) may have been less than the women but nevertheless his potential (capability) to be well nourished was much greater than hers. The capability approach has been employed extensively in the context of human development, for example, by the United Nations Development Programme, as a broader, deeper alternative to narrowly economic metrics such as growth in GDP per capita.\n Activity 6.4\nIdentify an example in your locality to illustrate the differences and similarities between functioning and capabilities."

Until the 1990s, the approach was fragmented and disjointed, initiated by its specialized agencies or funds at various World Summits and Conferences to address three dimensions of development — economic, social, and environmental. The Millennium Declaration and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) saw the convergence of the development agenda of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and other development agencies.\nThe MDGs have provided a unified focus in the development community unlike anything \nthat preceded them. The eight goals listed in table 6.2  are ambitious: to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and empower women; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and foster a global partnership for development. The goals were then assigned specific targets deemed achievable by 2015 based on the pace of past international development achievements."

The \nrole of agriculture in economic development has been considered as largely passive and supportive or secondary. In the Western economies, the industrial sector was given priority, based on the assumption that it has the greatest potential to adopt technology and to create forward and backward linkages with the other sectors.\nHowever, the desirability of placing such heavy priority on industrial growth is \nquestionable for most developing countries like Ethiopia. Since the 1970s, development economists have come to realize that the agricultural sector needs to be viewed as a leading and dynamic sector. They further state that, without the development of the agricultural sector, the growth of the industrial sector will become weak. Hence, the agricultural sector has to be the leading sector, and this is the approach of the current Ethiopian strategy of development. \nLearning Outcomes  \nAt the end of this unit, you will be able to: \n\tdefine the uni-modal agricultural strategy.\n\tdefine bi-modal agricultural strategy.\n\tunderstand the different  policies and strategies applied by the Imperial, Derg, \nand recent government."

It is based on the concept that specific peasants are not separated from their means of production and retain a degree of control over land and family labor  in spite of international secular differentiations (e.g. in  Japan, Thailand and China).

There were targets for the production of agricultural marketable products like cereals, cotton, cattle, and coffee; and for the rate of growth of agriculture were set. To achieve the production targets three main approaches were outlined: \na. Execution of land reform, \nb. Introduction of tools implements and machinery as well as elementary training of the producers so as to raise productivity,\nc.  Per capita income and consumption so as to transform the subsistence economy into a monetized economy.\nThe land reform policy was completely ignored, a fact which basically accounted for the failure and above all, there was lack of progress in policy measures and organizational programs, which were essential for the success of the plan. Because of all these, the agricultural sector could not develop as much as it was anticipated in the plan.\nIn the later era of the regime, it is argued that modernization of peasant subsistence \nagriculture in all areas of the country simultaneously is hardly possible, but no time should be lost in making a start in strategically selected areas in which good results can soon be seen. This being the strategy, two main approaches for the development of Ethiopia agriculture were indicated in the third five-year plan. These were the package program and the development of large-scale commercial farms:\n1. Large-Scale Mechanized Commercial Farm (LSMCF): the main objective of \nthis path was to facilitate agricultural exports and to create new employment opportunities. As the name implies, LSMCF requires bringing extensive areas of land under cultivation with the use of modern agricultural inputs such as modern technology, machinery, equipment (tractors and combines), chemical fertilizers and hired labor, in contrast to the family labor which is used in the small-holder farming system. The government took some fiscal measures to encourage the expansion of these farms in the country. Among the resulting policy measures were credit arrangements, tax holidays for the first five years for investments in excess of 200,000 Birr, low land use fees, tax-free import of heavy machinery, and possibilities of remitting profits to investor countries of origin. As a result, some foreign-owned profitable plantations were developed. They mostly produced food and fiber. However, these results were too small to achieve the given incentives. They accounted for almost 5% of the total agricultural output and 3% of the total area that was cultivated. The 1974 popular uprising led to the nationalization of"

Establishment and development of package projects: the basic objective of donors \nand the government in initiating the package project in Ethiopia was to repeat the success of the Green Revolution of India in Ethiopia. The Green Revolution was a type of agrarian revolution which was characterized by the large-scale use of improved and high yield variety (HYV) seeds and other inputs. The package approach was successful in improving the productivity of farmers in Mexico, India, Bangladesh, Israel, etc. There were two types of package projects: comprehensive package projects and minimum package projects. \nComprehensive Package Projects were designed to supply important inputs such as chemicals, fertilizers, improved seeds and farm tools, credits, pesticides, and know-how. The supplies of these inputs were for the purpose of: \n\traising the living standard of the  peasants;\n\tcreating labor-intensive employment opportunities; \tencouraging peasant participation in the development process; and\texpanding experimental stations for propagating new ideas in agricultural \ntechnology and providing improved farm tools. \nAs part of the comprehensive package projects  the Chilalo Agricultural Development Unit \n(CADU), the Welayita Agricultural Development Unit (WADU), and the Adaa District \nDevelopment Package Project (ADDP) were established. Some achievements  were \nobserved in these project areas. For example, income of participating farmers increased, productivity in crops and livestock was increased significantly, and the adoption of modern inputs expanded in the project areas. But there were also some adverse effects,  \nincluding an increase in the eviction of tenants. Another problem which is associated with these projects was their huge cost.  Because of these problems, the comprehensive package project was too difficult to be duplicated in other areas of the country. Therefore, a relatively less costly package program, known as the “minimum package program”, was launched, substituting for the comprehensive package projects which covered larger areas. \nThe minimum package program is designed in order to raise production and income of \nsmallholders quickly over a wide area with a minimum reliance on scarce resources. These \nprojects involved the diffusion of a few proven imports of agriculture such as chemical fertilizer, improved seeds, and farm implements. The small amount of resources allocated made the projects unsuccessful."

Industry-led development was deployed as the main development strategy. Rural land and other productive assets were nationalized, and land was distributed among farmers. Commercial farms were put under government control, and land tenancy was abolished. Furthermore, private commercial laborers and commercial farming were marginalized, and large collectivization programs were promoted through resettlement and civilization programs. \nThe new policy paradigm was manifested in different sectors of the economy.  The \ncomprehensive and the minimum package projects were launched during the Imperial Regime were continued in the Derg period. CADU was transformed into Arsi Rural Development Unit (ARDU) and then to Bale-Arsi Rural Development Unit (BARDU), which resulted in the thinning of resources over wide areas. Finally, all these projects were transformed into Peasant Agricultural Development Extension Projects (PADEP) which was organized along pluralist principles. The government also organized the small holders along socialist lines for the purpose of the collective production and marketing of agricultural output and distribution of inputs. In general, the agricultural sector policies of the military government were characterized by the following: \n\tnationalization of all private and commercial farms; \n\t prohibition of private investment in the agricultural sector; \tinvoluntary collectivization of peasants into peasant associations, and into \nproducers’ and service cooperatives; \n\tforced villagization and settlements; \tgovernment control of virtually all agricultural input and output markets; \tforced food-grain quota deliveries at predetermined low prices; and\t restriction of the movement of agricultural outputs from one part of the country \nto another. \nThese improper government interventions were the primary reasons for the lack of success \nin the development of the agricultural sector, in particular, and the national economy, in general."

The overriding objective of the government was given as attaining fast economic development. The government adopted Agricultural Development-Led Industrialization (ADLI) in 1994, which revolved around enhancing the productivity of smallholder agriculture and industrialization based on the utilization of domestic raw materials via adopting labor-intensive technology. The essence of this strategy rests on the belief that the agricultural sector can serve as the driving force for the rest of the economy. This means that the strategy aims at better use of the massive agricultural labor force in rural areas. It has internal forward and backward linkages with the industrial sector. This strategy has been adopted by the government to fit in the Ethiopian context. An extensive extension program which had been launched in 1994/95 was the Participatory Demonstration and Training Extension System (PADETES).  In this system, packages of fertilizer, improved seed and credit, as well as information on input use and better agricultural practices were delivered to the vast majority of smallholders in the rural areas by government. In this regards, improvement of productivity through extending the use of modern technology had attracted the attention of government. However, even though government had extended different packages, particularly the fertilizer credit package, the average agricultural output failed to sustain the high population growth. The Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program was an integrated rural and agriculture development strategy which was launched in 2002 on account of the limited success of PADETES. It was the first full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that was developed and implemented by the Ethiopian government through:\n\tStrengthening agricultural extension services\n\tTraining extension agents in Technical and V ocational Education and Training \n(TVET) and training farmers in Farmers Training Centers\n\tWater harvesting and irrigation \timproved marketing opportunities\tRestructuring peasant cooperatives \tSupporting micro-finance institutions. \nHowever, heavy dependency of the agricultural sector on the amount and timing of \nrainfall means that the output continuously fluctuates.

Among the top priorities identified by the government are: small and large-scale irrigation development, financing agricultural inputs, increasing productivity of crops and livestock, improving agricultural production methods using mechanization, post-harvest loss reduction, developing a research-based food security system, and natural resource management. In addition, as part of the Home-Grown Economic Reform Agenda, the government is looking to the agro-processing sector as one engine to spur future economic growth.\n7.3 Problems of the Agricultural Sector \nAt the end of this section, you will be able to: \n\tunderstand major problems in the sector.\n\texplain the different measures to alleviate problems in agricultural sector ."

Natural problems: these problems are related to recurrent drought and its \nnegative effects. Almost all the farming and livestock practices in the highlands of Ethiopia depend on rainfall. The variability of rainfall in time and amount affects the country’s crop production and live-stock rearing; millions of cattle have died. \nB.

About 75% of rural household farms are located far away from transportation and communication lines, and this that prevents farmers from accessing proper markets and information about prices for their products. \n\tLack of credit facilities : this prevented farmers from using even the meager \nresources available at hand. Now, however, reforms have created accesses to micro-finance loans, opening the gate to increasing small holder productively . \n\tLack of effective land-ownership entitlement: without effective land ownership \nentitlement, there will be poor work attitudes, improper use of common resources, and poor output. \n\tErosion and land degradation : erosion and degradation, contribute to the \nrecurrence of drought. Without preventative measures, this situation will accelerate in the near future, putting millions of hectares out of use. \n\tTraditional practices : these are rural practices that result in misusing work time, \nunproductive consumption and retaining resources especially livestock resources unscientifically, resulting in very low output per ox, sheep, goat, etc. \n\tThe use of backward technology."

However, industrialization is not a structural inevitability. Industrialization requires careful management of policy options and consistent monitoring of sectorial dynamics. \n7.4.1 The Imperial Regime (pre-1974)\nA conscious move to stimulate industrial growth began in the mid-1950s. The plan envisaged achieving industrial development through the development of import-substituting light industries which produced consumer goods for the domestic market. In the plan it was anticipated that foreign direct private investment would play the leading role in financing the investment capital required for the sector. Various policy measures were introduced to encourage investment in manufacturing including protection of the domestic industry through high tariffs and banning of certain imports, fiscal incentives, and provision of credit. The plan also foresaw other roles for the government in boosting industrial development including infrastructure and human resource development and direct investment in selected sectors mainly those which require high capital such as oil refinery, cement, sugar, and textile.\nThe driving philosophy of the industrial policy in the imperial period can be characterized \nas in favor of market and private sector but sought gaps whereby the government should play a role including direct ownership in selected sectors. In practice, the incentive structure was biased towards import-substituting, larger, capital-intensive, and foreign-dominated industrial activities.\nThe implementation of these initiatives attracted foreign investors and gave boost to the \nmanufacturing sector in Ethiopia. However, by the end of the plan period, the overall industrial base of the country remained weak and was characterized by a dual structure – a rudimentary small-scale and handicraft sub-sector and a modern medium-large-scale sub-sector, each contributing about half of the manufacturing value added. In this period the modern medium- and large-scale manufacturing sector (MLSM), which employs ten or more people and use power-driven machinery, was predominantly foreign owned.\n \n 7.4.2 The Derg Regime (1974-91)\nThe military government nationalized most of the MLSM enterprises, which were later reorganized under state corporations.

Private \ninvestment was restricted to not exceed half a million Birr (approximately a quarter of a million US$) and entrepreneurs could participate in only one venture. Price controls were instituted covering a wide range of products and the labor market was highly regulated.  Imports were also subjected to quantitative restrictions and higher tariffs in this period. \nThe manufacturing sector exhibited a sharp decline particularly in the first few years \nfollowing the revolution. In 1977/78 the government initiated a successive production campaign locally known as ‘zemecha’ to improve productivity mainly through increasing capacity utilization and have partly reversed the declining trend. Nevertheless, the government had no industrial policy per se until the mid-1980s. The main focus of the industrial development plan in this period was to promote the import-substituting and labor intensive industries. The Public sector investment was considered as the main mechanism in progress towards industrialization. In March 1990, the regime adopted a mixed economic policy to shift the country from one of a centrally managed economy to a modest liberal economy. This initiative was, however, too late and short-lived without bearing fruit, as there was a regime change in May 1991.\n7.4.3 The Post-1991 Regime\nIn 1998, the Ethiopian government adopted an export promotion strategy in an effort to address the lack of progress in export diversification. The strategy aimed at promoting high value agricultural exports (e.g. horticulture products and meat) and labor-intensive manufacturing products (clothing, textiles, leather and leather products). This strategy was, nonetheless, relatively narrow in scope. A comprehensive industrial policy was then formulated in 2002/03.  In 2002/03, after a decade in power, the EPRDF-led government formulated a comprehensive industrial development strategy (IDS).  The IDS is based on the Agricultural Development Led Industrialization (ADLI). \nThe Industrial Development Strategy (IDS) adopted in 2003 emphasized: \n\texport-led industrialization, and focused on labor-intensive industries, \n\tthe development of infrastructure to support rapid economic growth, and\tthe development of small enterprises for massive job creation and poverty \nreduction \nFundamental principles of the strategy are: \n\tconsidering the Private Sector as an Engine of the Industrial Development \nStrategy"

In contrast to the neo-liberal advice the strategy explicitly argues for a strong role of the state; not merely as a facilitator but also as a leader (i.e., providing direct support, coordinating and guiding the private sector). Inspired by the East Asian experience the, government has recently introduced the language of ‘developmental state’ as its policy principle regarding the state-business relationship. The strategy cites two important mechanisms in which the government could engage:\n\tpromote the private sector; creating a conducive environment,\n\tprovide direct support for selected sectors.\nIndustrial Park Development in Ethiopia \nSince the 1960s, an increasing number of countries have embarked on the road to promote"

For developing \ncountries, industrial parks can maximize resource integration for limited production factors within a certain spatial scope. By attracting labor and capital-intensive domestic and foreign investment in manufacturing and service industries, industrial parks not only increase job opportunities, wages and skills of local workers but establish links to global value chains through participating in international competition, making full use of comparative advantages to promote the upgrading of industrial structure, and constantly improving the country’s position in the international division of labor.

Given such a low saving \nrate, it is difficult to undertake industrial investment. High collateral requirements by the formal lending institutions have aggravated the problem of financial shortage. \n2. Marketing problems: the market problems arise due to:  \n\tWeak domestic demand for manufacturing output — this is due to the subsistence \nnature of agriculture on which the vast majority of the people rely for food, etc. As a result, the purchasing power of the people is very low. \n\tLack of marketing information about both local and export markets. \tStrong competition from cheap imports.  \tA consumer bias against local products. \n3. Technological Problems: these  may reveal themselves in one of the following ways: \tLack of sufficient information on appropriate technology. This is related to the \nshortage of local institutions involved in technological support services. \n\t The technology in Ethiopia today is not developed based on available local raw \nmaterials. This limits the linkage. It rather makes the shortage of foreign currency of the country. The ratio of imported raw material is too high for Ethiopian local manufacturing to flourish. The situation is worse in basic iron and steel, and motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers \n\t The technology is also capital-intensive. This approach is basically not \nrecommended for economies like Ethiopia where unemployment is rising. \n4. Input related problems: the high cost and shortage of foreign exchange for imported \ninputs has resulted in a shortage of raw materials as the second most serious problem, the most serious of which are market-related problems. There are also other problems policy problems and human-resource-related problems in relation to lack of skilled manpower and absence of industrial discipline and work ethics.

The Imperial Government initiated a comprehensive study of the education system. The education sector review (ESR) recommended attaining universal primary education, ruralizing the curricula through the inclusion of informal training, equalizing educational opportunities, and relating the entire system to the national development process. However, the ESR was not published until February 1974. Post-1974: the military government dismantled the feudal socioeconomic structure \nthrough a series of reforms that also affected the educational sector. By the early 1975, the government had closed Haile Selassie I University and all senior secondary schools had deployed some 60,000 students and teachers to rural areas to participate in the government’s development through cooperation campaign (commonly referred to as Zemecha). In 1975, the Derg Regime nationalized all private schools. Education for socialist consciousness, education for production and education for science and research were the objectives and directives set during the military government. The Military Government also worked towards a more even distribution of schools by concentrating its efforts on small towns and rural areas that had been neglected during the Imperial Regime. Post-1991: the gross enrollment ratios for primary and secondary education have since \nshowed a Post 1991, the ESDP (Education Sector Development programme) was launched. This program has the following six components: \n1. Primary education: this includes the construction, expansion, and rehabilitation of primary schools; curriculum revision and development; upgrading of teachers’ skills; and increasing the supply of textbooks. \n2. Secondary education: expansion of school services; curriculum revision and development; and increases in the supply of educational equipment and material. \n3.

Definite policies and strategies for the development of health service were not formulated until 1963. However, efforts were made to include the health sector into the development plans. After the 1974 revolution, Ethiopia embarked upon different approaches towards solving health-sector problems, through the declaration of primary health care in a ten-year development plan in 1978. In these approaches, priority was given to creative types of strategies. It was highly centralized and there was little collaboration between public and private providers. \nThe Ethiopian Transitional and Federal Government formulated the 1993 Health Policy \nand Strategy. Goals of the Federal Government and the regional administrations included reorganizing health services to make them more cost effective and efficient so that they contribute more to the overall socioeconomic development effort of the country.   Following the change of government in 1991, a number of political and socioeconomic reform measures were put in place. Two of these were the development and introduction of a new National Health Policy in 1993 and the formulation of a comprehensive rolling 20-year Health Sector Development Plan (HSDP) in 1997. Both are the results of the critical assessment and analysis of the nature and causes of the country’s health problems. The HSDP is now in its third phase (HSDP III). The major goals of the health policy are:\n decentralization of the health care system, \n development of preventive, facilitative, and curative components of health care, \n assurance of accessibility of health care for all segments of the population, \n and the promotion of private-sector and NGO participation in the health sector . \nThe national health policy focuses on a comprehensive health service delivery system to address:\n\tcommunicable diseases \tmalnutrition \timproving maternal and child health \nThe health service delivery system is decentralized with the responsibility for implementation being largely devolved to the districts, which operate on the basis of block funding for the sector. The policy emphasizes inter-sectoral collaboration, particularly in ensuring family planning for efficient family health and population planning, in formulating and implementing an appropriate food and nutritional policy, and in accelerating the provision"

The entire commercial truck and passenger transport system was under strict control of the government through Proclamation No.107/1976. The policy changes in the sector that occurred on May 8, 1992 heralded the deregulation of the freight transport industry. The major liberalization of the transport industry began with government Proclamation No. 14/1992. This emphasizes the promotion of efficiency and equitable distribution. Following the 1992 Proclamation, many of the private commercial freight and passenger transport activities left the corporation and formed their own independent association. Some, however, continued as associates of government enterprises. The other content of the new policy allows: \n\tfree entry into existing associations, \tobtaining licenses to form new associations\n \n7.5.4 The Tourism Sector \nTourism should have been one of Ethiopia’s largest industries. This is because Ethiopia has so many historical and natural sites and diverse cultural tourism attractions, but unfortunately the country has been unable to realize the economic benefits it deserves from the sector. Nonetheless, in recent years, due to the development of infrastructures, like roads and hotels, and to the crucial role of the government in marketing and changing the image of the country through its embassies, tourism has shown significant growth despite the economic crisis in the world. However, there is still a long way to go before Ethiopia will fully exploit the benefits of the tourism sector efficiently and secure its appropriate position in the economic sectors. In 2009, the government launched a tourism development policy to increase tourist arrivals and optimize returns from the sector. The guiding principles are: \n guiding the sector in a broad-based development framework\n developing existing and new tourism attractions and products\n expanding the infrastructure and tourist services that are vital for the growth of the sector \n ensuring that the country benefits from the sector by being sufficiently competitive in international tourism markets \n solving the serious limitations in capacity that are apparent in the industry"
