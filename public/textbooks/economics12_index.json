Even countries that made rapid progress in areas like medicine, engineering, technology, electronics, and information technology were not immune from economic problems. For example, problems like poverty, unemployment, inflation, recession, and population explosion are worldwide today. To understand these problems and find solutions, an adequate knowledge of economics is required.\nThe study of economics is expected to equip students with subject knowledge, understanding, \nskills, values and attitudes about important questions and issues of economy, society and environment. It will also help them develop their competencies to engage in the community as informed and active citizens.\nThis textbook is intended to support the learning of economics so that students possess \nthe tools to understand their economic world and how to interpret events that will, either directly or indirectly affect them. Moreover, students will be supported to relate and translate economic concepts to explain economic reality on the ground. They will also be helped to acquire and develop their knowledge on what to expect in the future and how to manage their economic decisions.\nFinally, as per the Ethiopian General Education Curriculum Framework (GECF), \nEconomics for Grade 12 is one of the compulsory general subjects in Social Sciences and Agriculture. Career and Technical Education that offer economics as a course are Business Sciences, Language and Social Sciences, Performing and Visual Arts and Agriculture. Economics for Grade 12 (consisting of 8 units) will be covered in the total of 87 hours and 45 minutes per year, 3 periods each week with 45 minutes per period. In line with the above expectations, the student profile and the textbook contents are presented below.\nSTUDENT PROFILE\nAt the end of Grade 12 Economics study, students are expected to have better attributes in terms of the following:\nKnowledge\n\tKnowledgeable in subject area (principles, theories, applications, etc.)\nAttitude\n\tCooperation"

On the other hand, macroeconomics studies overall or aggregate behaviour of the economy such as the overall level of output, prices and employment. In other words, macroeconomics studies what happens to the whole economy or economic system.\nMacroeconomics is a relatively new branch of economics that emerged after the publication \nof John Maynard Keynes’ book entitled: The General Theory of Employment, Interest and"

The word “macro’ is derived from the Greek word “makro”, which means \nlarge. This term differs from microeconomics. Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, while macroeconomics focuses on the economy as a whole. In a nutshell, macroeconomics is the study of the structure and performance of national economies and of the policies that governments use to try to affect economic performance. Therefore, in order to gain an understanding of broader problems and to find solutions, an adequate knowledge of macroeconomics is a requirement.\n1.1.2 The Focus Areas of Macroeconomics\nThe focus areas of macroeconomics are aggregate behaviour of the economy, such as economic growth, employment, inflation, distribution of income, macroeconomic policies and international trade. The study of macroeconomics helps us understand and try to find answers for central macroeconomic questions such as:\n\tWhat factors determine the flow of total output produced in the economy over time?\n\tHow can a nation increase its rate of economic growth? \n\tWhy do outputs and employment sometimes fail? \n\tWhat are the causes of inflation and how it can be controlled? \n\tHow do government policies affect output, unemployment, inflation, and growth?\n\tHow can business cycle downturns be managed? \n\tHow does the domestic economy interact with the rest of the world?\nThese questions are related to macroeconomic goals. The goals include achieving \neconomic growth, full employment, price stability, as well as reducing budget or balance of payment deficit, and ensuring fair distribution of income in society. Thus, a country’s macroeconomic health is examined through such goals as the rise in the standard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation.\nIn order to address these goals, it is necessary to understand macroeconomic variables \nwhich show the status and trends of the whole economy. Examples of such variables include gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product (GNP), economic growth rate, price level (rate of inflation and deflation), investment, savings, consumption, government budget, level of employment and unemployment, total labour force, demand for money and supply of money, total export, total import, trade balance and exchange"

The above mentioned questions and goals of macroeconomics relate to the focus \nareas of macroeconomics as shown in Table 1.1.\nThe macroeconomic variables such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), unemployment rate, and inflation help us determine the macroeconomic performance of a country. By macro economy, we refer to all buying and selling, all production and consumption or everything that goes on in every market in the economy. Hence, the first step towards understanding macroeconomy is to measure its performance. In a sense, macroeconomics is primarily concerned with the forecasting of GDP, by analysing the major economic factors that show predictable trends and patterns, and how they influence with each other.\nIn connection with this, it is necessary to elaborate the concept of GDP which is defined \nas the measure of the market value of all final goods and services which are produced in a country during a year. \nA related measure is the Gross National Product (GNP), which is defined as the total value of final goods and services that are produced by domestically owned factors of production in a given period of time, usually one year, irrespective of their geographical locations.

They are product/value added approach, \nexpenditure approach and income approach. Each of them is briefly discussed as follows.\n•\tProduct approach: here, the GDP is calculated by adding the market value of goods and services that are currently produced by each sector of the economy. Only the values of final goods and services are included to avoid double counting.\n•\tExpenditure approach: here, the GDP is measured by adding all expenditures on final goods and services that are produced in the country by all sectors of the economy. Thus, GDP can be estimated by summing up personal consumption of households (C), gross private domestic investment (I), government purchases of goods and services (G) and net exports (NE).\n•\tIncome approach: in this approach, GDP is calculated by adding all the incomes accruing to all factors of production used in producing the national output. Then, the GDP is the sum of incomes to owners of factors of production (in the form of wages and salaries, rental income, interest income, and profits) as well as some other claims on the value of output less subsidies and transfer payments.\nFor as long as market values and prices are involved in GDP calculation of GDP, we have nominal GDP (measured in actual market prices) and real GDP (calculated in constant prices by taking a base year). Real GNP accounts for difference in price levels in different counties, in cases where inter-country comparisons of GNP are considered. An upward or downward movement in real GDP is the most widely used measure of the level and growth of output."

It is a necessary ingredient for both high incomes and higher living standards. Higher GDP per capital translates to better diet, health, life expectancy and greater educational opportunity.\nThe GDP expands or shrinks over time depending on the overall economic environment. \nThe rate at which the real GDP of a country increases over a period of time is known as the “economic growth rate.” A higher economic growth rate can be achieved by increasing the amount of factors of production such as labour, land, capital and their productivity. It has to be supported by institutional arrangements such as adherence to the rule of law,"

Principally, economic growth measures economic performance in terms of value of income, expenditure, and output.\nMeasuring real income in developing countries is not simple as we may think. This is \nbecause in developing countries real income is generally understated compared to that of developed countries. The reasons are: \na)The national income account may understate GDP in developing countries because the majority of the population are subsistence farmers who produce for their own consumption and such outputs are not correctly reported. \nb)Underreporting income is common in developing countries due to fear of tax and it is partly due to inefficient taxation systems. \nc)Usually, no allowance is made for non-monetary sectors in the national income account of less developed countries. \nd)Distortion in prices is much higher in developing countries than in developed ones. \ne)The cost of pollution and environmental degradation are not deducted from gross national product to get net GNP in developing countries while in developed countries such as Sweden and the Netherlands, the cost of pollution is deducted to get net GNP.\nIn addition, the above simple measure of growth has two limitations. First, the national income is in the value terms, which change as the price level changes. Even if physical volume of goods and services remains the same, the growth rate could be positive for the simple reason that inflation has to be taken into account while measuring economic growth (in real terms). Second, it cannot take into account the population growth as there are several instances where population has grown more than national income. \nIn order to overcome the above two problems, economists have suggested measuring \neconomic growth in terms of a rise in real per capita income, which is the ratio of total GNP to total population. Taking the per capita income as an indication of average standard of living has many limitations. As any average measure, it conceals more than it reveals. In recent years, this measure has come under increasing criticism as an index of development. \nFirst, there is no difference in economic growth and development as the same indicator is \nused to measure both of them. Moreover, there is no relationship between the definition of development and measure of development in terms of per capita income. Therefore,"

A measure of development \nmust take into account not only the level of per capita income and its distribution but also other indicators of quality life such as level of education and health status. \nThis leads us to an index called the Human Development Index (HDI). HDI was deployed \nby United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and it is sometimes called the “quality of life index.” This is basically a non- monetary index which measures the level of development. The typical approach in constructing such an index is to take a number of non-monetary indicators such as educational stocks and flows, fertility and mortality rates, availability of physical and social infrastructures, and compress them by various statistical techniques into a single composite index of development.\n1.2.2 Inflation\nThe prices of goods and services do not always stay the same. This means that sometimes they rise and at other times they fall. The word “inflation” represents a regular and continuous rise in the general price level. Since the general price level refers to the average price of goods and services, inflation represents the rising prices of almost all goods and services. Moreover, inflation is cumulative whereby even a small rise in price in the beginning may become a very large one in the future. \nSimilarly, the rate of inflation denotes the rate of growth or decline of the price level \nfrom one year to the next. It is the percentage change in the overall level of prices. It varies greatly over time and across countries. Contrarily, the fall in price level is called “deflation” (see the mathematical formulations on the next page).\nGenerally speaking, a substantial and rapid rise in the general price level induces a decline \nin the purchasing power of money, which means people must spend more to buy a litre of milk or a kilogram of sugar. It is obvious that when prices rise, money buys less and the standard of living declines over time. Therefore, inflation increases the cost of living, and decreases the purchasing power of currency.\nIn order to protect citizens from the increased cost of living, some governments index \ncontracts, wage levels, and interest rates to inflation. Indexing wage contracts and interest rates means that they will increase when inflation increases to retain purchasing power. When wages do not rise as price levels rise, this leads to a decline in the real wage rate and a decrease in the standard of living. For this and other reasons, inflation is the major"

Thus, the CPI of each month reflects the ratio of the current cost of the basket divided by its base-period cost. \nHence, from the CPI angle, the rate of inflation or deflation is calculated as the percentage rate of change in a price index. To calculate the inflation rate, one has to subtract the past date CPI from the current date CPI and divide the answer by the past date CPI, and then multiply the results by 100. For example, if your current price total is 560 Birr and your past price total is $340, your equation would be 560/430 = 1.30. Then multiply this by 100 to create a baseline for the consumer price index, which makes 130. Then you will subtract 100 (baseline) from 130. That means, 130-100 = 30%. The total 30% represents a percentage change in prices from the previous year.\nNumerical example of calculating inflation is as follows. Assume the current date CPI 25% and past date CPI is 20. So, 25 - 20 = 5/past date CPI (20) = 0.25. Multiply this by 100 to get a percentage. The inflation rate is 25%.\nExample: Calculating the consumer price index (CPI) and the inflation rate. \nAssume a simple economy in which a typical consumer buys only two goods-wheat\nand edible oil.

A decrease in the general level\nof the prices of goods and services is known as deflation. Deflation is the oppositeof inflation. Therefore, there was inflation in the years 2001 E.C. and 2003 E.C. and deflation in the year 2002 E.C.\nTypes of Inflation\nNow, let us explore the type of inflation. It is broadly the case that, during inflation, the \nsupply of goods and services is less in comparison to their demand (i.e. aggregate demand is higher than aggregate supply) resulting in a situation where too much money is chasing too few goods. Yet shortage in supply of goods and services alone does not provide the sole explanation.\nInflation classified on the basis of speed of occurrence and can be termed as creeping, \nwalking, running, galloping inflation, and hyperinflation. Thus, creeping  inflation is \nmoderate inflation that occurs when the price level persistently rises over a period of time at a slow rate such as the price rise in 3% or less. Walking inflation occurs when annual \ninflation rate is a single digit or in the range of 3 to less than 10% per year. Running \ninflation occurs when prices rise rapidly at the rate of 10 to 20% per year. Galloping or \njumping inflation occurs at a quick rate (dual or triple-digit annual rates) for a short period of time. Hyperinflation refers to a situation where the prices of goods and services rise \nuncontrollably, for example, at the rate of increase at more than 50% a month.\nLikewise, inflation is also classified on the basis of causes such as demand-pull or cost-push \ninflation as well as wage, profit, scarcity, deficit, currency, credit and foreign trade induced inflation. Many of these causes are related to how money is supplied and demanded in the economy. For instance, when governments print money to finance expenditure, this translates into an increase in the money supply which causes inflation. The printing of"

As prices rise, the real value of the money in one’s wallet falls. Hence, inflation is like a tax on holding money ( Mankiwi, 2016).\nIndeed, most episodes of high inflation and hyperinflation are caused by governments’ need to obtain revenue from printing money. Sometimes, inflation reaches extraordinarily high levels. The most extreme cases are hyperinflations, which are traditionally defined as periods when inflation exceeds 50% per month. The all-time record inflation took place in Hungary in July 1946 (with the monthly inflation of 41.9 quadrillion percent amounting to prices doubling every 15.3 hours). The hyperinflation in Zimbabwe in 2007-2009 was almost as large, with prices at times doubling daily ( Romer, 2019). As the result, the \nZimbabwean government printed ever higher currency notes, including a $100 trillion bill, to cover its widening deficits. Then, by late 2008, the money was nearly worthless, which led Zimbabwe to adopt the US dollar, immediately halting its hyperinflation.\nMoreover, there is a consistent pattern that wars are associated with inflation. There are \nreasons for this. For example, during a major war, a government needs to acquire large amount of resources (goods and manpower). Printing money seems like a relatively painless way for the government to acquire some of these resources. Wars, falls in export prices, tax evasion, and political stalemate frequently leave governments with large budget deficits. In addition to this, investors often do not have enough confidence that the government will honour its debts in order to buy its bonds. As a result, a government’s only choice is to resort to printing money hence contributing to inflation.\n1.2.3 Unemployment\nA person is employed if he or she spends some of his/her time working at a paid job. A person is unemployed if he or she is not employed and has been looking for a job or is on temporary layoff. On the other hand, a person who fits into neither of the first two categories, such as a full-time student or retiree, is not in the labour force. In the case of Ethiopia, the population aged 14 to 60 is termed as economically active or of working age. Yet formal employment requires a minimum of 18 years of age. According to the Ethiopian labour law, the labour force does not include children under the age of 14, retired people over 60 years old and those in mental and correctional institutions.\nFrom the economic point of view, unemployment is the macroeconomic problem that \naffects people most directly and severely. It has economic costs to broader society. For"

The opportunity cost of unemployment is the output that the unemployed workers could have produced. Hence, the costs of unemployment justify making a low level of unemployment a public policy priority. In other words, since one aspect of economic performance is how well an economy uses its resources, and workers are the economy’s main resource, keeping workers employed is a paramount concern of economic policymakers. In order to address the problem of unemployment, policy makers need to know about the labour market, the labour force, labour force participation rate and the unemployment rate. These concepts are detailed below.\nThe labour force  is defined as the sum of the employed and unemployed. The total labour \nforce refers to the percentage of the population that is willing and able to work. The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labour force that is unemployed \nor the percentage of those people who want to work and who do not have jobs or those who are out of job despite willingness to work at the existing wage rate. \nThe labour-force participation rate  is the percentage of the adult population that is in \nthe labour force.\nThere are different types of unemployment. The major ones are frictional, cyclical and \nstructural unemployment.\nFrictional unemployment occurs during the time when workers move between jobs \nwhich take s time on part of both the employer and the individual to match those who"

This results in a lack of \nperfect mobility of workers between jobs. One example of frictional unemployment is the case of individuals entering the workforce for the first time after graduating from college/university or searching for their first job. They are unemployed until they get their first job.\nCyclical unemployment occurs due to a deficiency of aggregate effective demand resulting \nfrom business depressions ( Dewett,1997). International factors may generate this kind of \nunemployment. For example, lack of demand for coffee or other agricultural products in overseas markets, resulting from unfavourable business cycles that has a knock-on effect to the employment situation in a domestic economy. Another example of this is that workers will be laid off when the economy is in recession.\nStructural unemployment is a form of involuntary unemployment that happens when \nthere is lack of adjustment between demand for and supply of labour. As the name \n“structural” implies, the economic changes are extensive amounting to a transformation of an economic structure. It is possible that the work force could grow faster than the stock of capital of a country and the addition of the labour force cannot be absorbed in productive employment. Moreover, there are situations where employers may lack knowledge about the availability of workers or the workers may not know that employment is available with a relevant employer. Individuals may also lack the skills that are valued by the labour market, either because demand has shifted away from the skills they have, or because they never learned any skills. Education is the key in minimizing the amount of structural unemployment. For instance, individuals who have degrees can be re-trained if they become structurally unemployed. On the other hand, for people with no skills and little education, that option is more limited. In sum, structural unemployment is caused by such factors as the lack of necessary skills for a particular job, labour immobility, breakdowns of machinery, and shortages of raw materials.\nOn other hand, there is a form of unemployment categorised as underemployment which \nrefers to the situation in which person is forced by unemployment to take a job that he/\nshe thinks is not adequate for his/her purpose, or not commensurate with his/her training. Furthermore, there are those who work full time in terms of hours per day but earn very little to rise above the poverty level. Open and disguised unemployment in urban and rural areas are estimated at 30-35% of the labour force in underdeveloped countries."

The term “business cycle” (also known as “trade cycle”, “economic cycle” or “boom-bust cycle”) refers to economy-wide fluctuations in production, trade, and general economic activities. The fluctuations represent upward and downward movements in levels of GDP or the period of expansions and contractions in the level of economic activities around a long-term growth trend.\nBusiness cycles as fluctuations recur with a certain degree of regularity following a \npendulum like oscillation. There are upward swings and then downward swings in business as shown in Figure 1.1. According to some economists, every boom is followed by a slump and vice versa ( Vaish, 2010). Business cycles have four distinct phases: \nexpansion, peak, contraction, and trough. An expansion is characterized by increasing \nemployment, economic growth, and upward pressure on prices. A peak is the highest \npoint of the business cycle, when the economy is producing at maximum possible output, employment is at full employment, and inflationary pressures on prices are evident. Following a peak, the economy typically enters a correction which is characterized by a contraction where growth slows, employment declines (unemployment increases), and \npricing pressures subside. The slowing ceases at the trough and at this point the economy \nhas hit a bottom from which the next phase of expansion will emerge.\nIn sum, economic fluctuations are not regular and predictable. Recessions are common but irregular. So, what causes short-run fluctuations? What model should we use to explain"

Here, a model refers to an organising framework that represents a simplification \nof the system under investigation. Can policymakers avoid recessions? If so, what policy levers should they use? It is noted that just as Egypt now controls the flooding of the Nile Valley with the Aswan Dam, modern society tries to control the business cycle with appropriate economic policies ( Mankiw, 2016). \n1.2.5 Balance of Trade\nThe balance of trade  is another macroeconomic variable that affects national economies. \nThe balance of trade is the difference between export and the import of goods and services of a country for a given period; it is also an important component of the balance of payment of a country.\nThe balance of payment is the systematic record of a nation’s financial transactions with \nthe outside world. It is divided into current and capital accounts. The current account\nshows the market value of a country’s export and import of goods and services, investment income, debt service payments, and private and public net remittances and transfers. \nThe capital account shows the volume of private foreign investment and public grants \nand loans that flow into and out of a country over a given period. Countries pay interest \non loans they receive. For this, they pay a sum of interest payments and repayments of principal on external debt, which is also called debt service  (Todaro and Smith, 2015).\nThe balance of trade (or trade balance) is any gap between a nation’s dollar value of exports and imports. When imports exceed exports, the result is a trade deficit in the economy. In other words, if exports exceed imports, the economy has a trade surplus. On the other hand, if exports and imports are equal, then trade is balanced. Now, let us compare two countries, namely, Ethiopia and China, with different trade balances. In 2020, Ethiopia ran a trade deficit of about US$10.7 billion while China had a substantial commodity trade surplus amounting to about US$535 billion in the same year. \nThe question is: What happens when trade is out of balance and large trade surpluses, or \ndeficits exist? Many nations seek trade surpluses; however, some degree of trade deficits \nis economically tolerable for countries when such a deficit reflects the importing of capital \nequipment which can then be used to boost productivity and output.\nA series of financial crises which are triggered by unbalanced trade can lead economies \ninto deep recessions. These crises begin with large trade deficits. At some point, foreign"

This happened to Mexico in 1995 when its GDP fell by 8.1%. Several countries in East Asia (Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia) succumbed to the same economic illness in 1997-1998 (called the “Asian financial crisis”). In the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, Russia and Argentina had the identical experience (Mankiw, 2016). \nProblems with trade imbalances do not reduce the importance of the economic benefits \nfrom foreign trade. In the globalised world of today, countries benefit from diversity in production possibilities (due to difference in endowments), economies of scale and decreasing costs as the volume of output expands, as well as satisfaction of different tastes/preferences for commodities from different countries (Samuelson and Nordhaus, 1995).\n Activity 1.2\n1.

In the subsequent sections, we will briefly distinguish the classical and neoclassical, the Keynesian, the monetarist, the new classical, and the new Keynesian schools of thought.\n1.3.2 The Classical and Neoclassical\nThe classical view was the predominant economic philosophy until the Great Depression. The works of Adam Smith (1723-1790), David Hume (1711-1776), David Ricardo (1772-1823), Jean Baptiste Say (1767-1832), John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), Knut Wicksell (1851-1926), and Irving Fisher (1867-1947) can be categorised here. According to classical thinking, given flexible prices, the short-term fluctuations in economic activity would rather be quick and they would adjust back to full employment. This view of the economy implied a “hands off” policy approach. For example, if an economy slips into recession, it will temporarily exhibit a surplus of goods. Falling prices will eliminate this surplus, and the economy will return to a full employment level of GDP. In this case, no active fiscal or monetary policy is needed. Expansionary fiscal or monetary policy would only cause inflation, rather than increase the GDP. In other words, fiscal policy is useless in affecting employment and output while increasing government spending will lead to a higher rate of interest and full crowding out of private investment, without effecting changes in the price level. On the other hand, monetary policy has no effects on the real sphere of the economy, and it only leads to a higher price level. For classical economists, the real and monetary sectors could be studied separately. Demand-side policies merely affect the interest rate and/or the price level, while supply-side policies affect the real wage, employment, and output.\nLinked to this preference for supply side policies are economists termed as supply-siders, \ne.g. Arthur Laffer (1940 -) and Robert Mundell (1932-2021). Supply-siders despise government intervention in the markets and emphasize the distorting effects of taxation. Their policy advice is to cut tax rates to stimulate the economy. They argue that there is no need to cut government spending because the tax cut will pay for itself, hence there is no need to restrain public spending on defence, for example, while having an excuse to substantially cut the tax rate. The central element of this argument lies in the Laffer curve theory that was formalized by Arthur Laffer to show the relationship between tax rates and"

The curve is used to illustrate \nthe argument that cutting tax rates can sometimes result in increased total tax revenue.\nNeoclassical economics is the name given to an economic theory that was developed \nat the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century in Europe. The main \ncontributors to this theory were Léon Walras (1834-1910), Alfred Marshall (1842-1924) and Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923). \nNeoclassicals base their ideas mainly on the writings of Alfred Marshall and his followers. \nThey closely follow the findings of the classical school but emphasize the limitation of some of the classical doctrines, notably that of laissez faire. Moreover, they make use of the concept of marginal utility and accept mathematical economics as one method of presentation. \nAs the name implies, the neoclassical view of how the macro-economy works is a “new” \nview of the “old” classical model of the economy. The neoclassical view on macroeconomics holds that in the long run, the economy will fluctuate around its potential GDP and its natural rate of unemployment. The two building blocks of neoclassical economics are that the potential GDP determines the economy’s size and wages, and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output. The key policy implication is that the government should focus more on long-term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment. This means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long-run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analysing the macroeconomic short run. \n1.3.3 Keynesian\nThe deep and lasting impact of the Great Depression of the early 1930s changed classical thinking. The self-correcting feature of the market, which is of course the hallmark of classical theory, simply did not work. Moreover, the events of the Great Depression contradicted Say’s Law which states that “supply creates its own demand”. Although production capacity existed, the markets were not able to sell their products. As a result, real GDP was less than potential GDP. As far as recession/depressions are concerned, the focus of Keynesian economics was on explaining why and offering a policy prescription for minimizing their effects."

            "text": "1.3 The Schools of Thought in Macroeconomic Analysis 20Grade 12 Economics Student Textbook\nFollowing on from John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946), Keynesian economics prescribed \nactive fiscal policy to alleviate weak aggregate demand. The idea for focusing on aggregate demand is simple: firms produce output only if they expect it to sell. While the availability of the factors of production determines a nation’s potential GDP, the amount of goods and services that are sold, known as real GDP, depends on how much demand exists across the \neconomy. Yet aggregate demand is not stable, Keynes argued; it can change unexpectedly.\nRecession, according to the Keynesian view, emerges from two key building blocks. \nFirst, aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment. Second, the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices, (i.e., wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand). \nThe first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the \nlevel of demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labour is fully employed. Suppose that the stock market crashes, as in 1929, or the housing market collapses, as in 2008. In either case, household wealth will decline, and consumption expenditure will follow the same path. Since businesses see that consumer spending is falling, they face reduced expectations of the profitability of investment, so they will decrease investment expenditure.\nAccording to Keynes, monetary policy is of little help as the additional money will simply \nbe absorbed by investors with no noticeable effect on the interest rate. Fiscal policy, on the other hand, will work well. The additional government spending will stimulate aggregate demand and hence employment and output.\n1.3.4 Monetarist\nThe monetarist view is represented by Milton Friedman (1912-2006) and his colleagues. They argued that it is monetary policy and not fiscal policy that addresses the macroeconomic problems. They noted that since they assumed the interest sensitivity of investment to be very high, fiscal policy leads only to strong crowding out of private investment. Fiscal policy, under monetarist assumptions, is unable to influence employment and output. This assumption means monetarists oppose the Keynesians who believed in stimulating economic activity by investment to ward off recessions. Furthermore, the monetarists’ assumptions imply that monetary policy has real effects. A policy maker may therefore be tempted to use a monetary expansion to combat unemployment. But then monetarists"

They underline \nthe long- and variable-time lags before a macroeconomic problem is recognized before an appropriate macroeconomic policy is implemented, and yields the required effect. When the policy is set too late, monetary policy can heighten business cycle fluctuations in the economy. To this end, Friedman suggested that the central bank should follow a constant growth rule for some monetary aggregate and not tinker with monetary policy to influence aggregate demand and employment.\n1.3.5 New Classical\nThe new classicals are the natural successors of the classical economists. That is why they can be termed as the modern-day classical economists. Economists like Robert Lucas (1937 -), Thomas Sargent (1943 -), Robert Barro (1944 -), Edward Prescott (1940 -) are listed in this category. The new classicals stress mathematical techniques. They support classical ideas such as flexible prices and wages, rational expectations or perfect foresight, the efficiency of the market, and full employment. All observable fluctuations in the economy are due to rational agents responding to the incentives as they observe them, not due to nominal rigidities.\nThey strongly endorse rational expectations and microeconomic underpinning of \nmacroeconomic relations, such as the consumption function, the investment function, and the labour market. They came up with the term “policy ineffectiveness proposition”, according to which the policy maker either cannot or should not use countercyclical policy.\n1.3.6 New Keynesian\nJust as the New Classicals are the natural successors of classical economists, so are the new Keynesians. Under the umbrella of the new Keynesians are found economists such as George Akerlof (1940 -), Edmund Phelps (1933 -), John B. Taylor (1946 -), Stanley Fischer (1943-), Olivier Blanchard (1948 -) and Gregory Mankiw (1958 -). \nWriting in the 1970s and 1980s, the New Keynesians derive their main inspiration from \nthe insights of John Maynard Keynes. For them, markets may not be as perfect as the classical economists suggest. They accepted the rational expectation hypothesis (REH), but stressed the existence of nominal rigidities, arising from multi-period nominal wage contracts. Such rigidities invalidate the policy ineffectiveness proposition (PIP) of the new classical economists. Hence, they argue for government to stabilize the economy, even under REH."

The macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product (GDP), the unemployment rate, and inflation help us to determine the macroeconomic performance of a country.\nThe state of macroeconomics has evolved since the 1930s and different schools of \nthought (the classical and neoclassicals, the Keynesians, the monetarists, the new classical \neconomists, and the new Keynesians) emerged."

Instead of the quantity of output of a single industry, this model represents the quantity of output of an entire economy (national production). Just as there are two sides to a market, a buying side (demand) and a selling side (supply), there are two sides to an economy: demand and supply sides. These are the two forces which operate on the macro economy and they are important tools that help explain the major economic trends. In macroeconomic analysis, we determine the level of overall economic activity in an economy, particularly the levels of output and prices through an interaction of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. This unit presents aggregate demand and aggregate supply, and then study equilibrium of aggregate demand and aggregate supply.\nLearning Outcomes\nAt the end of this unit, you will be able to: \n\tdistinguish the difference between a change in the quantity demanded and a change in demand.\n\tdiscuss various explanations for wage and price stickiness.\n\tdemonstrate graphically the short run and long run equilibrium in relation to potential output.\n\texplain how the AS–AD model is used to analyse economic fluctuations."

What are the similarities and differences between aggregate \ndemand and aggregate supply from your point of view?\n2.1.1 Concept of Aggregate Demand\nAggregate demand (AD) refers to the total amount that different sectors in the economy willingly spend in a given period. This is because it is measured by the total expenditure of the economy’s community on goods and services. More specifically, AD is defined as: the total amount of money which all sections (households, firms, and governments) are ready to spend on the purchase of goods and services produced in an economy during a given period.\nAlternatively, AD is the sum of spending by consumers, businesses, and governments \nwhich depends on the level of prices as well as on monetary policy, fiscal policy and other factors. In other words, it is the total spending by all the entities in the economy. Moreover, we may say aggregate demand is the total expenditure on consumption and investment."

Net exports are determined by domestic and foreign incomes, relative prices and exchange rates.\n2.1.2 The Aggregate Demand Curve\nThe aggregate demand (AD) curve is a schedule that shows the amount of real output that buyers collectively desire to purchase at each price level ceteris paribus. The relationship between the price level and real GDP demanded is inverse or negative."

The inverse is also true. Thus, the AD curve is a downward sloping curve. It indicates the output (goods and services) which will be demanded in the economy at various general price levels. \nFigure 2.1  shows that when the general price level falls \n10  P to P , the aggregate quantity \ndemanded of the output increases 1 0Q toQ  . Consequently, there is an inverse relationship \nbetween the general price level and aggregate demand. Remember here what you learnt in Grade 9  about the relationship between the price of an individual commodity and its \ndemand (law of demand).\nWhy Does the Aggregate Demand Curve Slope Downward?\nAsking why the AD curve slopes downward is the same as asking why there is an inverse \nrelationship between the price level and the quantity demanded of real GDP. This inverse \nrelationship, and the resulting downward slope of the AD curve, is explained by the real balance effect, the interest rate, and the international trade effect.\nReal Balance Effect \nThe real balance effect states that the inverse relationship between the price level and the \nquantity demanded of real GDP is established through changes in the value of monetary \nwealth, or money holdings. A rise in the price level causes purchasing power to fall, which \ndecreases a person’s monetary wealth. For example, as people become less wealthy, the quantity demanded of real GDP falls.\nInterest Rate Effect\nThis is also called a “money supply effect”. A rise in price with a fixed money supply, other \nthings being equal, leads to tight money and produces a decline in total real spending.\nThe inverse relationship between the price level and the quantity demanded of real GDP \nis established through changes in household and business spending that is sensitive to changes in interest rates. A higher price level increases the demand for money. So, given a fixed supply of money, an increase in money demand will drive up the price paid for its use. That price is the interest rate. Higher interest rates curtail investment spending and interest-sensitive consumption spending. Firms that expect a 6% rate of return on a potential purchase of capital will find that investment is potentially profitable when the"

But the investment will be unprofitable and will not be made \nwhen the interest rate has risen to 7%. Similarly, consumers may decide not to purchase a new house or new automobile when the interest rate on loans goes up. So, by increasing the demand for money and consequently the interest rate, a higher price level reduces the amount of real output demanded.\nInternational Trade Effect The international trade effect states the inverse relationship between the price level and \nthe quantity demanded of real GDP, which is established through foreign sector spending. \nSuppose that the price level in Ethiopia rises. As this happens, Ethiopian goods become relatively more expensive than foreign goods. As a result, both Ethiopians and foreigners buy fewer Ethiopian goods. Due to this, the quantity demanded of Ethiopia’s real GDP falls.\nChange in Quantity Demanded Vs Change in Aggregate Demand\nA change in the quantity demanded of real GDP is brought about by a change in the price \nlevel. For example, as the price level falls, the quantity demanded of real GDP rises, ceteris paribus. A change in the quantity demanded of real GDP is represented as a movement\nfrom one point to another along the same demand curve.\nA change in aggregate demand is a shift in the aggregate demand curve from AD\n1 to \nAD2 (see Figure 2.2). Try to notice also that when the aggregate demand curve shifts, the \nquantity demanded of real GDP changes even though the price level remains constant. \nGeneral Price level remaining constant, any positive change in any of these factors causes a rightward shift in the AD curve, and a negative change shifts the AD curve leftward. These factors include:\n\tgeneral level of income of the people, \treal interest rate,\tlevel of economic activity in other countries (it determines the level of exports), \tavailability of credit, \tthe level of economic activity in the economy itself."

In other words, what \ncan cause aggregate demand to rise and what can cause it to fall? The simple answer to these questions is that aggregate demand changes when the spending on Ethiopian goods and services changes. For example, if spending increases at a given price level, aggregate demand rises; if spending decreases at a given price level, aggregate demand falls. \nWhen individuals, firms, and governments want to buy more Ethiopian goods and services \neven though the prices of these goods have not changed, then we say that aggregate demand has increased. As a result, the AD curve shifts to the right. Of course, when individuals, \nfirms, and governments want to buy fewer Ethiopian goods and services at a given price level, then we say that aggregate demand has decreased. As a result, the AD curve shifts to \nthe left. In short, a rise in consumption, investment, government purchases, or net exports will increase spending on Ethiopian goods and services. Similarly, a fall in consumption, investment, government purchases, or net exports will lower spending on Ethiopian goods and services.\nSince we now know what causes total expenditure on Ethiopian goods and services to \nchange, we can relate the components of spending to (Ethiopian) aggregate demand. If, at given price level, consumption, investment, government purchases, or net exports rise, \naggregate demand will rise and the AD curve will shift to the right.

Namely, policy variables under government \ncontrol, e.g. monetary and fiscal policy variables, and exogenous variables which are determined outside the AD-AS framework, e.g. Foreign economic activity, technological change.\nIn this section, we will look at some of the factors that can change consumption, investment, \ngovernment spending and net exports. \nFactors Affecting Consumption\nFour factors that can affect consumption are wealth, expectations about future prices and \nincome, the interest rate, and income taxes.\n1.Wealth. Individuals consume not only the basis of their present income but also on the \nbasis of their wealth. Greater wealth makes individuals feel financially more secure \nand thus, more willing to spend. Increases in wealth lead to increases in consumption. For example, if consumption increases, then aggregate demand rises and the AD curve \nshifts to the right. What will happen if wealth decreases? Decreases in wealth lead to a fall in consumption, which in its turn leads to a fall in aggregate demand, consequently, the AD curve shifts to the left.\n2.Expectations about future prices and income. If individuals expect higher prices in \nthe future, they increase current consumption expenditures to buy goods at the lower current prices. This increase in consumption leads to an increase in aggregate demand. If individuals expect lower prices in the future, they decrease current consumption expenditures. This reduction in consumption leads to a decrease in aggregate demand. Similarly, expectation of a higher future income increases consumption, which leads to an increase in aggregate demand. In contrast to this, expectation of a lower future income decreases consumption, which leads to a decrease in aggregate demand."

Many of these items are financed by borrowing. So, an \nincrease in the interest rate increases the monthly payment amounts which are linked to their purchase and thereby reduces their consumption. This reduction in consumption leads to a decline in aggregate demand. Alternatively, a decrease in the interest rate reduces monthly payment amounts which is linked to the purchase of durable goods and thereby increases their consumption. This increase in consumption leads to an increase in aggregate demand.\n4.Income taxes. As income taxes rise, disposable income decreases and when people \nhave less take-home pay to spend, consumption falls. Consequently, aggregate demand decreases. Reduction in taxes has the opposite effect; it raises disposable income. In other words, when people have more take-home pay to spend, consumption rises and aggregate demand will increase."

For example, as the \ninterest rate rises, the cost of a given investment project rises and businesses invest \nless. As investment decreases, aggregate demand also decreases. On the other hand, as the interest rate falls, the cost of a given investment project falls and businesses invest more.

If businesses become optimistic about future sales, investment spending grows and aggregate demand increases. On the other hand, if businesses become pessimistic about future sales, investment spending contracts and aggregate demand decreases.\n3.Business taxes: Businesses naturally consider expected after-tax profits when making \ntheir investment decisions. For example, an increase in business taxes lowers expected profitability. With less profit expected, businesses invest less. As investment spending declines, aggregate demand declines. A decrease in business taxes, on the other hand, rises expected profitability and investment spending. This in its turn increases aggregate demand."

In contrast, a reduction in government spending (for example, fewer transportation projects) will shift the curve to the left.\nFactors Affecting Net Exports\nThe main determinants of net export are domestic and foreign incomes, relative price, \nexchange rate, domestic and foreign trade policies, and preferences and technology. For instance, a change in national income affects net exports. Just as Ethiopians earn a national income, so do people in other countries. For example, as foreign real national income rises, foreigners buy more Ethiopian goods and services. Thus, Ethiopia’s exports (EX) rise and as exports rise, net exports rise, ceteris paribus . As net exports rise, aggregate \ndemand increases. This process works in reverse, too. This means that as foreign real national income falls, foreigners buy fewer Ethiopian goods and exports fall. This in its turn lowers net exports, which reduces aggregate demand.\nIn the case of change in exchange rate affecting net exports, when a currency appreciates \nin value if more of a foreign currency is needed to buy it. A currency is said to depreciate\nif more of it is needed to buy a foreign currency. For example, a change in the exchange rate from $1 = 32 Birr to $32= 1 Birr means that more dollars are needed to buy 1 Birr, and Birr appreciates. This is because more dollars are needed to buy 1 Birr, when the dollar depreciates. Depreciation of a nation’s currency makes foreign goods more expensive. Consider an Ethiopia leather jacket that is priced at 1500 Birr when the exchange rate is 1Birr = 2 Indian Rupee. This would mean a person in India would have to pay 3000 Rupee. Now, suppose that the Indian Rupee depreciates to 3 Rupee = 1 Birr. People in India now have to pay 4500 Rupee for the jacket. This process is symmetrical, so an appreciation in a nation’s currency makes foreign goods cheaper. \nThe depreciation and appreciation of the Ethiopian Birr affect net exports. For example, \nas Birr the depreciates, foreign goods become more expensive. Hence, Ethiopians cut"

If exports rise and imports fall, net exports increase and aggregate demand increases. As the Birr appreciates, foreign goods become cheaper; Ethiopians increase their purchases of imported goods, and foreigners (whose currency has depreciated) cut back on their purchases of Ethiopia’s exported goods.

Aggregate demand is one side of the \neconomy; and aggregate supply is the other side. \nAggregate supply refers to the quantity supplied of all goods and services (real GDP) at \nvarious price levels, ceteris paribus. There is a direct or positive relationship between the price level and the amount of real output that firms offer for sale. Aggregate supply includes both short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) and long-run aggregate supply (LRAS). The short-run aggregate supply and long-run aggregate supply are discussed in the following section.\nThe Keynesian supply curve is horizontal. Firms will supply whatever amount of good is \ndemanded at the existing price level since there is unemployment. Firms can obtain much labour as they want at the current wage. Average costs of production are assumed not to change as their output level changes.\nThe classical aggregate supply curve is vertical, indicating that the same amount of goods \nwill be supplied whatever the price level based on the assumption that the labour market is always in equilibrium with full employment of the labour force (Dorrnbushpp, 2011).\n2.2.2 The Upward Sloping Aggregate Supply Curve: The Short Run (SRAS)\nThe short run is a time horizon during which at least one of the firm’s inputs cannot be varied, whereas, the long run, is a time horizon that is long enough for a firm to vary all of its inputs.\nThe amount of output firms are willing to supply depends on the prices they receive for their \ngoods and the amount which they have to pay for labour and other factors of production. Accordingly, the aggregate supply curve reflects conditions in the factor markets as well as the goods markets.\nThe short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the quantity supplied of all goods \nand services (real GDP or output) at different price levels, ceteris paribus. Notice also that the SRAS curve is upward sloping: as the price level rises, firms increase the quantity supplied of goods and services; as the price level drops, firms decrease the quantity supplied of goods and services. \nWhy is the SRAS curve upward sloping? Economists have put forth a few explanations, \nfrom which we will discuss only two of them,. sticky wages and worker misperceptions."

            "text": "2.2 Aggregate Supply 37UNIT 2: AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY ANALYSIS\nSticky wages: some economists believe that wages are sticky, or inflexible. This is the case \ndue to the fact that wages are “locked in” for a few years due to labour contract agreements entered into between workers and employers. For example, management and labour may agree to lock in wages for the next one to three years. Both labour and management may see this as in their best interest. Management has some idea of what its labour costs will be during the time of the contract, and workers may have a sense of security knowing that their wages cannot be lowered. Alternatively, wages may be sticky because of certain social conventions or perceived notions of fairness. Whatever the specific reason for sticky wages, let’s see how they provide an explanation of an upward-sloping SRAS curve.\nFirms pay nominal wages (e.g., $30 an hour), but they often decide how many workers to \nhire based on real wages. Real wages are nominal wages which are divided by the price level.\nNominal wageReal wage = Price level\nFor example, suppose that the nominal wage is $30 an hour, and the price level as measured by a price index is 1.50. The real wage is therefore, $20.\nNote that the quantity supplied of labour is directly related to the real wage: as the real \nwage rises, the quantity supplied of labour rises; as the real wage falls, the quantity supplied \nof labour falls. However, the quantity demanded of labour is inversely related to the real \nwage: as the real wage rises, the quantity demanded of labour falls; as the real wage falls, the quantity demanded of labour rises. \nWith this as background, suppose a firm has agreed to pay its workers $30 an hour for the \nnext three years and it has hired 1,000 workers. When this nominal wage was agreed, it was thought that the price index would remain at 1.50 and the real wage would stay at $20.\nNow, suppose that the price index falls to 1.25. When the price level falls to an index \nof 1.25, the real wage rises to $24 ($30/1.25). This is a higher real wage than the firm \nexpected when it agreed to lock in nominal wages at $30 an hour. If the firm had known that the real wage would turn out to be $24 (and not remain at $20), it would never have hired 1,000 workers. It would rather have hired, say, 800 workers instead.\nSo, what does the firm do? As we stated, there is an inverse relationship between the real \nwage and the quantity demanded of labour (the number of workers that firms want to hire)."

With fewer workers working, less output is produced.\nIn conclusion, if wages are sticky, a decrease in the price level (which pushes real wages up) \nwill result in a decrease in output. This is what an upward-sloping SRAS curve represents: \nas the price level falls, the quantity supplied of goods and services declines.\nWorker misperceptions: another explanation for the upward-sloping SRAS curve holds \nthat workers may misperceive real wage changes. To illustrate, suppose that the nominal wage is $30 an hour and the price level as measured by a price index is 1.50. It follows that the real wage is $20. Now, suppose that the nominal wage falls to $25 and the price level falls to 1.25. The real wage is still $20 ($25/1.25 = $20), but workers may not know this. They will know their nominal wage has fallen (they know they are earning $25 an hour instead of $30 an hour). They also may know that the price level is lower, but they may not know initially how much lower the price level is. For example, suppose that they mistakenly believe the price level has fallen from 1.50 to 1.39. They will then think that their real wage has actually fallen from $20 ($30/1.50) to $17.98 ($25/1.39).\nIn response to (the misperceived) falling real wage, workers may reduce the quantity of \nlabour that they are willing to supply. With fewer workers (resources), firms will end up producing less. In conclusion, if workers misperceive real wage changes, then a fall in the price level will bring about a decline in output, which is illustrative of an upward-sloping SRAS curve.\nChanges in Short-Run Aggregate Supply and Shifts in the SRAS Curve\nA change in the quantity supplied of real GDP is brought about by a change in the price level. This is shown as a movement along the SRAS curve, but what are the factors that are \nlikely to shift the SRAS curve?"

Changes in wage rates have a major impact on the position of the SRAS curve because wage costs are \nusually a firm’s major cost item. The impact of a rise or fall in equilibrium wage rates can be understood in terms of the following equation:\n  \nProfit per unit = Price per unit - Cost per unit\nHigher wage rates mean higher costs and, at constant prices, translate into lower profits \nand a reduction in the number of units (of a given good) managers of firms will want to produce. Lower wage rates mean lower costs and, at constant prices, translate into higher profits and an increase in the number of units (of a given good) managers will decide to produce. \nThe impact of higher and lower equilibrium wages is shown in Figure 2.4. At the given \nprice level, P\n1 on SRAS1, the quantity supplied of real GDP is Q1. When higher wage rates \nare introduced, a firm’s profits at a given price level decrease. Consequently, the firm \nreduces production. This, this corresponds to moving from Q1 to Q2, which at the given \nprice level is point B . Point B represents a point on a new aggregate supply curve (SRAS2). \nThus, a rise in equilibrium wage rates leads to a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve.

We will also discuss long-run equilibrium and explain how it differs from short-run equilibrium. As explained above, economists give different reasons for an upward-sloping SRAS curve. Recall that those reasons have to do with: sticky wages and \nworkers misperception. It follows, then, that short-run equilibrium identifies the real GDP where the economy produces when either of these two conditions hold. In time, wages will become flexible and misperceptions will turn into accurate perceptions. When this happens, the economy is said to be in the long run. In other words, in the long run, these \ntwo conditions do not hold.\nAn important macroeconomic question is: Will the level of real GDP that the economy \nproduces in the long run be the same as in the short run? Most economists say that it will \nnot. They argue that in the long run, the economy produces the full-employment real GDP \nor the natural real GDP (Q\nN).

This could arise from an expansionary monetary-policy action, an expansionary fiscal-policy action, or an increase in desired expenditures from another source. An increase in aggregate demand shifts the AD curve to the right; more output is demanded at each level of the aggregate price index. A demand shock can either be expansionary or contractionary. An expansionary demand shock shifts the AD curve to the right, increasing both P and Y. Notice that we use the word “expansionary” or “contractionary” to refer to \nthe effect of the shock on the equilibrium level of output.\n2.3.2 Shocks to Aggregate Supply\nAggregate supply shocks cause P and Y to change in opposite directions. For example, an improvement in production technology or an increase in the amount of labour or capital resources available would increase the aggregate amount produced and thus, shift the short-run AS curves to the right. A storm that destroyed agricultural crops or a sudden interruption in the availability of imported inputs such as oil might cause a reduction shift to the left in the AS curves. Consider the effects of a negative supply shock. An example of a negative supply shock is an increase in the price of oil. Beginning at point A, an increase in the price of oil causes a decrease in the supply of the product which results in a leftward shift of the aggregate supply curve from SRAS, results in a decrease in output from Y\n1 to \nY2  and an increase in price from Y1  to Y2."

However, the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity of a good may not be the optimal price and quantity. For example, tobacco and alcohol are over-consumed and education and healthcare are under-consumed in the absence of government intervention. Market failure occurs when the free market fails to allocate resources efficiently or distribute goods and services equitably.\nAllocative efficiency is achieved when it is impossible to change the allocation of \nresources in the economy in a way that will increase the welfare of society. This occurs when marginal social benefit is equal to marginal social cost. Marginal social benefit is the sum of marginal private benefit and marginal external benefit, whereas marginal social cost is the sum of marginal private cost and marginal external cost. On the other hand, external costs and benefits, or externalities, are costs and benefits of consumption or production which are experienced by society other than the producers or the consumers. Although the free market has numerous merits, it may not allocate resources efficiently or distribute goods and services equitably. In this unit, market failure, public goods, externalities, asymmetric information and consumer protection will be discussed.\nLearning Outcomes \nAt the end of this unit, you will be able to: \n\tdefine market failure. \n\tidentify the cause of market failure.\n\tstate the characteristics of public goods. \n\tdefine the concept of externalities and asymmetric Information.\n\texplain the concept of consumer protection."

It occurs when the price mechanism fails to account for all of the costs and benefits that are necessary to provide and consume a good. Furthermore, the individual incentives for rational behaviour do not lead to rational outcomes for the group. In other words, each individual makes the correct decision for himself/herself, but these may prove to be the wrong decisions for the group. In traditional microeconomics, this is shown as a steady state disequilibrium in which the quantity supplied is not equal to the quantity demanded.\n\tThe structure of market systems contributes to market failure. It is obvious that \nin the real world that it is not possible for markets to be perfect due to inefficient \nproducers, externalities, environmental concerns, and lack of public goods.\n\tGovernment responses to market failure include legislation, direct provision of \nmerit and public goods, taxation, subsidies, tradable permits, extension of property"

Such a group either incurs too many costs or receives too few benefits. The economic outcomes under market failure deviate from what economists usually consider optimal and are usually not economically efficient. Even though the concept seems simple, it can be misleading and easy to misidentify.\nContrary to what the name implies, market failure does not describe inherent imperfections \nin the market economy-there can be market failures in government activity, too. One noteworthy example for this is that rent-seeking by special interest groups. Special interest groups can gain a large benefit by lobbying for small costs on everyone else, such as through a tariff. When each small group imposes its costs, the whole group is worse off  than if no lobbying that had taken place.\nAdditionally, not every bad outcome from market activity counts as a market failure. Nor \ndoes a market failure imply that private market actors cannot solve the problem. On the flip side, not all market failures have a potential solution, even with prudent regulation or extra public awareness.\n3.1.1 Common Types of Market Failures\nCommonly cited market failures include externalities, monopoly, information asymmetries, and factor immobility. One of the examples to illustrate market failure is the public goods problem. Public goods are goods or services for which the producer cannot limit consumption to paying customers and for which the consumption by one individual does not limit the consumption by others.\nNational defence is one such public good because each citizen receives similar benefits \nregardless of how much they pay. It is very difficult to privately produce the optimal amount of national defence. Since governments cannot use a competitive price system to determine the correct level of national defence, they also face major difficulty producing the optimal amount. This is an example of a market failure with no pure solution.\n3.1.2 Solutions to Market Failures\nThere are many potential solutions for market failures. These can take the form of private market solutions, government-imposed solutions, or voluntary collective action solutions.\nExternalities such as pollution are solved with tort lawsuits that increase opportunity costs"

Tech-companies that receive positive externalities from tech-educated \ngraduates can subsidize computer education through scholarships.\nGovernments can also impose taxes and subsidies as possible solutions. Subsidies can \nhelp encourage behaviour that can result in positive externalities. Meanwhile, taxation can help cut down negative behaviour. For example, placing a tax on tobacco can increase the cost of consumption, therefore making it more expensive for people to smoke.\nPrivate collective action is often employed as a solution to market failure. Parties can \nprivately agree to limit consumption and enforce rules among themselves to overcome the market failure of the tragedy of the commons. Consumers and producers can band together to form co-ops to provide services that might otherwise be underprovided in a pure market, such as a utility co-op for electric service to rural homes or a co-operatively held refrigerated storage facility for a group of dairy farmers to chill their milk at an efficient scale.\n Activity 3.1\nExplain some common causes of market failure\n3.2 Public Goods\nAt the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\tdefine public goods. \n\texplain the characteristics of public goods.\n\texplain the free rider problem.\n\tCompare and contrast efficiency difference between pure public and private goods. \n Start-up Activity\n1.Have you ever appreciated the satisfaction you got from using street lights?\n2.

Generally speaking, public goods have \ntwo major features. \n\tNon rivalry in consumption : once the good is provided or supplied, consumption \nby one person does not reduce the quantity which is available for consumption by another. This means that the same amount is left for the remaining consumers. This implies that the cost /marginal cost of allowing another person to consume the good is zero. \n\tNon-excludability: it is difficult and expensive to prevent or to exclude someone \n(non-payers) from consuming the good. \nGoods that fulfil both these properties are known as “pure public goods”. Examples of such goods are national defence, clean air, biodiversity, wilderness, etc. These are extreme cases. At the other extreme, pure private goods which are rivalrous in consumption and excludable. Most goods around us fall into this category. E.g. Food items, clothes, household furniture, houses. \nThere are also goods which fall in between these two extremes. A good can satisfy one \npart of the definition of a public good and not another. These kinds of goods are called “impure public goods”. Based on this, we can generally classify public goods into four major groups, as presented in Table 3.1 below.\nClassification of goods as public goods is not absolute; it depends on market conditions and technology.

Many forms of \ninformation  have characteristics of public goods. For example, a poem can be read by \nmany people without reducing the consumption of those goods by others; in this sense, it is non-rivalrous. However, the individual who wrote the poem may prohibit non-payers from using it through copyright (excludable). Some countries have developed tool booths and radio waves to monitor traffic and enforce some payments of using certain road (for example, Ethiopian express roads Addis Ababa to Adama or Addis Ababa to Hawassa). Hence, with the help of technology excludability can easily be applied.\n\tAnother aspect of public goods is that although everyone consumes the same quantity of goods, they may not value them equally. For example, for some individuals, national defence is very important while others do not care for it, some others still value it negatively though it is equally available to all.\n\t A number of things that are not conventionally considered to be commodities have public good characteristics. Examples include honesty, fair income distribution, certain information, polio vaccination, and HIV/AIDS blood tests. \n\tPrivate goods are not necessarily supplied by the private sector; government may provide private goods too. Many private goods such as electricity, and telecommunications are supplied by governments and many pubic goods like protection and guarding are supplied by the private sector.\n\tPublic provision of a good does not necessarily mean that it is produced by the public sector/government. For instance, a government/municipality may collect the garbage using its own trucks and labour or it may hire a private firm to do the job. In both cases, the government provides the services, but it produces only in the former case. Table 3.2 distinguishes the difference between pure private and \npure public goods."

This problem was first observed in trade union where not-members benefit from the successful bargaining of unions members. As result, they were not willing to become a member and make a contribution. Free ridership arises because public goods are non-excludable. Since it is difficult to exclude non-payers from using/benefiting, there is an incentive not to pay/to be free rider. It is this free rider problem that causes markets to operate inefficiently for public goods. Suppose that individual A chooses to be free rider. Since B is equally smart, he/she also has an incentive to let other people pay. Hence, there is no automatic force that makes the good provided. For this reason, market failed to supply it. The private market may provide no output as no one is willing to purchase it. \nOther Mechanisms for Providing the Efficient Level of Public Goods\nIn those cases where the private market fails to provide the efficient level of public goods, \nprovision of public goods requires collective action. People need to realize that public goods’ situation exists and either raise contributions from private individuals to fund the public goods or let the government provide the public goods. Mechanisms to provide public goods include the following:\na. private provision of excludable public goods (e.g. movies, music concerts).b. public provision of excludable public goods through the use of entrance fees(e.g."

This is also true in case of production. Firms produce goods, but in doing so they also pollute the environment. The pollution does not cost the firm anything, but there is a negative externality to society.\nExamples: smoking contaminates the clean air in the room or environment. Non-smokers \nsuffer while they have no part in its in consumption. Downstream farmers suffer from the effects of sewage discharge into rivers, while no compensation is made for them through market mechanism. \nThe characteristics of externalities are listed below:\n1. As mentioned above, externalities can be either positive or negative. Some externalities \nare beneficial, while others are harmful. An economic agent is said to generate positive \nexternalities when its activities benefit the third party. It generates negative externalities when its activity harms the third party. Here, we consider the producer/seller as first party, and the buyer as the second party. Examples of activities that generate positive externalities include, flower farming, education, street light, neighbouring fence, park, beautifying land escape, neatness of neighbourhood, etc. Activities that generate negative externalities are smoking, shouting, and manufacturing of products such as textiles or leather garments which emit carbon dioxide to the air and waste into the nearby rivers. Pollution, global warming, and climate change are also negative externalities.\n2. Externalities can be generated by consumers or producers. E.g, smoking by individuals \nand some manufacturing both cause air pollution. Externalities can be viewed as special kind of public good or bad. They are no rival, and non-excludable. And public good generate external benefit.\n3. Externalities are reciprocal in nature.\nA firm may impose externalities on residents by creating bad smell or odour on the other \nhand, resident demand for less aroma which can be seen as imposing cost upon firm. Fishermen can be thought as polluting as it creates cost upon producers in using the water. Smoker imposes an extensity on non-smoker, but non-smoker also imposes a burden on smoker. This concept is related to the question that whether the injured or injurer is responsible in car accident. Externalities are not the result of one person’s action, but results from combined action of two or more parties."

In other words, asymmetric information is when one party in a transaction is in possession of more information than the other. In certain transactions, sellers can take advantage of buyers because asymmetric information exists whereby the seller has more knowledge of the good being sold than the buyer. \nIn general, information asymmetry deals with the study of decisions in transactions where \none party has more information than another. This creates an imbalance in power in transactions which can sometimes cause the transaction to go away. Two types of problems associated with asymmetric information are adverse selection and moral hazard."

It is sometimes known as “hidden information problem” or “anti-selection problem” or “negative selection problem”. Adverse selection problem is a term that is used in economics, insurance, statistics and risk management.\nExamples:\ni) When bad results occur due to information asymmetries between buyers and sellers, \nthe bad products or customers are more likely to be selected.\nii) Health insurance is more likely to be purchased by people who are more likely to get sick.\nMoral Hazards Problem\nThis refers to situation where one side of the market cannot observe the actions of the \nothers. It is sometimes known as “hidden action problem”. In simple words, it is the inability to observe and/or verify the agents’ action. Furthermore, it is the prospect that a party insulated from risk may behave differently from the way it would behave if it was fully exposed to the risk. A moral hazard problem arises when an individual or situation does not bear the full consequences of its actions, and therefore has a tendency to act less carefully than it otherwise would, leaving another party to bear some responsibility for the consequences of those actions.\nExamples: \ni) An individual with insurance against automobile theft may be less vigilant \nabout locking his/her car, given that the negative consequences of automobile theft are (partially) borne by the insurance company.\nii) Ex-post moral hazard: insured parties do not behave in a more risky manner that results in more negative consequences, but they do ask an insurer to pay for more of the negative consequences from risk as insurance coverage increases. \ne.g. without medical insurance, some forgo medical treatment due to its costs \nor simply deal with substandard health. But, after medical insurance becomes available, some may ask and insurance provider to pay for the cost of medical treatment that would not otherwise have undergone."

There is no denying the fact that the consumers have the basic right to be protected from the loss or injury which is caused by defective goods and deficiency of services. But many consumers do not exercise their rights due to lack of awareness, ignorance or laziness. However, in view of the prevailing malpractices and their vulnerability to them, it is necessary to provide them physical safety, protection of economic interests, access to information, satisfactory product standard, and statutory measures for redressal of their grievances.

With a view to bringing about desirable changes in such variables, nations, developed as well as developing, need to adopt various macroeconomic policies. These policies and the instruments used for their implementation vary from one economy to another and also according to the prevailing economic conditions within a specific economy.\nThe economy does not always work smoothly. This is because fluctuations often occur in \nthe level of economic activity. At times the economy finds itself in the grip of recession when levels of national income, output and employment are far below their full potential levels. During recession, there is a lot of idle or unutilized productive capacity, that is, available machines and factories are not working to their full capacity. As a result, unemployment of labour increases along with the existence of excess capital stock. On the other hand, at times the economy is “overheated” which means inflation (i.e., rising prices) occurs in the economy. Thus, in a free market economy there is a lot of economic instability. The classical economists believed that an automatic mechanism works to restore stability"

That is why Keynes argued for government intervention to cure depression and inflation by adopting appropriate tools of macroeconomic policy as you learnt in Unit 1. \nEvery nation wants to raise the level of living of its people. This can be attained by bringing about economic growth which in turn depends on raising the rates of saving and investment and accumulating capital. In this regard, macroeconomic policies can play a useful role in raising the rate of saving and investment and ensure rapid economic growth.\nThe general objectives of macroeconomic policy are to achieve:\n\tmaximum feasible output\n\thigh rate of economic growth\tfull employment\t price stability\tequality in the distribution of income and wealth\ta healthy balance of payments.\nTo achieve these objectives, different types of macroeconomic policies – fiscal, monetary, income, and foreign exchange policies – are adopted.

What do you understand about fiscal policy?\nFiscal policy is the expenditure and revenue (tax) policy of the government to achieve the \ndesired objectives. \n4.2.1 Tools of Fiscal Policy\nThere are two key tools of the fiscal policy:\nTaxation: funds in the form of direct and indirect taxes, capital gains from investment, \netc, help the government function. Taxes affect the consumer’s income and changes in \nconsumption lead to changes in real gross domestic product (GDP).\nGovernment spending: it includes welfare programmes, government salaries, subsidies,\ninfrastructure, etc. Government spending has the power to raise or lower real GDP, hence it is included as a fiscal policy tool.\nIn the standard textbook classification, government spending/expenditure has four major \ncomponents, namely, government spending, transfer payments, grants in aid, and net interest payments.\n(a) Government spending (G)\nGovernment spending is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services. It includes salaries of public servants, purchase of weapons for the military, and any investment expenditure by a government(b) Transfer payments\nTransfer payments are direct payments to individuals- such as unemployment insurance \nbenefits, social security benefits, Medicare, or welfare payments - where goods or services are not provided in return. They are commonly referred to as entitlements because they are not made on a discretionary basis, but are locked in by earlier legislation."

(d) Net interest payments\nNet interest payments are interest payments that are made to holders of government debt, \nless interest which is paid to the government for debts like student loans.\nFrom the revenue side, the four major components of tax revenue (taxes) are the following:\n\tPersonal taxes are composed of income taxes and property taxes, and are major \nsources of total government revenue.\n\tContributions for social insurance are primarily social security taxes, which are \nassessed as a fixed percentage of a worker’s wages, up to a fixed ceiling (or cap).\n\tTaxes on production and imports are primarily sales taxes, but they also include \ntaxes on imported goods, known as “tariffs”.\n\tCorporate taxes are primary taxes on the profits of businesses.\n\tGrants in aid are the federal assistance to state and local governments and are \nrevenue for them (while they are spending for the federal government). \n4.2.2 Types of Fiscal Policy \nA fiscal policy can be of two types – expansionary or contractionary depending upon \nprevailing economic conditions.\nI.Expansionary Fiscal Policy\nIn a situation in which an economy is facing the problem of deficient demand, i.e., \naggregate demand falling short of output at full employment, there is a depression marked by overproduction, a rise in unemployment, and a fall in prices and incomes. To increase the aggregate demand and thereby total output and employment levels, expansionary fiscal policies are adopted by governments. The major instruments of expansionary fiscal policy are: \n\tExpenditure policy (increase expenditure) : the objective of an expenditure policy \nshould be to pump more money into the system in order to boost demand. During a period of deficiency in demand, the government should make large investments in public works like the construction of roads, bridges, buildings, railway lines, canals, etc. In such periods, the government should also provide free education and medical facilities, even though these activities might enlarge budget deficits."

If possible, taxes on lower income groups should be abolished in order to increase their disposable income for spending. In addition, subsidies, old age pensions, unemployment allowances, grants, interest-free loans, expand so as to increase aggregate demand in the economy.\nThe aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is useful in judging whether expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy is appropriate. For instance, as we can see in Figure 4.1, \nthe intersection of aggregate demand (AD\n0) and aggregate supply (SRAS0) are occurring \nbelow the level of potential GDP as the LRAS curve indicates. At the equilibrium (E0), a \nrecession occurs and unemployment rises. In this case, expansionary fiscal policy using tax cuts or increases in government spending can shift aggregate demand to AD\n1, closer to \nthe full-employment level of output. In addition, the price level will rise back to the level P\n1 that is associated with potential GDP.\nII. Contractionary Fiscal PolicyWhen an economy’s aggregate demand is for a level of output that is more than the full-employment, the demand is said to be an excess demand. In other words, excess demand refers to the excess of aggregate demand over the available output at full employment. This gap results in an inflationary situation as it causes inflation (a continuous rise in prices) in the economy. To control the situation of excess demand and thereby reduce the"

In this way, the government will reduce the budget deficit, which shows excess expenditure over revenue.\n\tRevenue policy (increase taxes): during inflation, the government should raise rates of all taxes, especially taxes on rich people, because taxation withdraws purchasing power from the taxpayers and, to that extent, reduces effective demand. Care should be taken that measures adopted to raise revenue are disinflationary and at the same time have no harmful effects on production and savings.\nFiscal policy can also contribute to pushing aggregate demand beyond potential GDP in a way that leads to inflation. As Figure 4.2 shows, a very large budget deficit pushes \nup aggregate demand, so that the intersection of aggregate demand (AD\n0) and aggregate \nsupply (SRAS0) occurs at equilibrium E0, which is an output level above potential GDP. \nEconomists sometimes call this an “overheating economy” where demand is so high that there is upward pressure on wages and prices, causing inflation. In this situation, contractionary fiscal policy involving federal spending cuts or tax increases can help to reduce the upward pressure on the price level by shifting aggregate demand to the left, to AD\n0, and causing the new equilibrium E1 to be at potential GDP, where aggregate demand \nintersects the LRAS curve\n."

The National Bank is a government \nagency that oversees the banking system and is responsible for the conduct of monetary \npolicy. This bank takes different names in different countries: the Federal Reserve System in the United States and National Bank in Ethiopia, for instance.\nMonetary policy consists of the management of money supply and interest rates, aimed \nat meeting macroeconomic objectives such as controlling inflation , consumption, growth, \nand liquidity. This is achieved by actions such as modifying the interest rate, buying or \nselling government bonds, regulating foreign exchange rates, and changing the amount of money which banks are required to maintain as reserves. \nMonetary policy is formulated based on inputs which are gathered from a variety of \nsources. For instance, the monetary authority may look at macroeconomic numbers such asgross domestic product (GDP) and inflation, industry/sector-specific growth rates \nand associated figures, as well as geopolitical developments in international markets—including oil embargos or trade tariffs. These entities may also ponder concerns which are \nraised by groups representing industries and businesses, survey results from organizations of repute, and inputs from the government and other credible sources.\n4.3.1 Tools of Monetary Policy\nThe National Bank influences the money supply indirectly by changing the monetary base or the reserve deposit ratio. To do this, it has three instruments/tools at its disposal: Open \nmarket operations (OMO): these are the purchases and sales of government bonds by the National Bank. The Birr it pays when the National Bank purchases bonds increases the monetary base and the money supply. When the National Bank sells bonds to the public, the Birr it receives reduces the monetary base and then, decreases the money supply. \nThe conduct of OMO varies from country to country depending on the legal and institutional \nsetting, the structure of financial system and the stages of development in the securities market of the country. NBE conducts its OMO actively through treasury bills market to influence the variables like liquidity level and net domestic assets of the banking system and money supply in the economy and monitor whether they conform with the targeted level. In light of this, the NBE uses open market operations as one of its monetary policy instruments. In the absence of its own securities, a certain amount of government treasury bills need to be allocated to NBE by the government for its monetary policy purpose (NBE, 2009)."

The discount rate is set by the National Bank’s board of governors, and can be adjusted up or down as a tool of monetary policy. It is usually set below the short term inter-bank market rate. Accessing the discount window allows institutions to vary credit conditions (i.e., the amount of money they have to loan out), thereby affecting the money supply. Through the discount window, the central bank can affect the economic environment, and thus unemployment and economic growth. In Ethiopia the discount window facility for commercial banks started in March 2001.\n2.Required reserve ratio (RRR): this refers to the funds that banks must retain as a proportion of the deposits made by their customers in order to ensure that they are able to meet their liabilities. Lowering this reserve requirement releases more capital for the banks to offer loans or to buy other assets. Increasing the reserve requirement, on the other hand, has a reverse effect, curtailing bank lending and slowing growth of the money supply.\nThe NBE uses this instrument to control the liquidity of banks by varying the rate according with the targeted level. The higher reserve requirement contracts the liquidity as well as credit expansion power of commercial banks and the opposite will increase liquidity and credit expansion power of banks. The National Bank of Ethiopia cut the minimum deposit reserve from 15% to 10% in January 2012. It also cut the liquid assets to deposits ratio by the same margin to 20% from 25% previously. The move is aimed to encourage banks to lend money, particularly to the export sector.\n4.3.2 Types of Monetary Policies\nGenerally speaking, monetary policies can be categorized as either: a monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing, i.e. an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy, conversely or a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy, i.e. a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy.\nExpansionary Monetary Policy\nIf a country is facing a high unemployment rate during a slowdown or a recession, the \nmonetary authority can opt for an expansionary policy which aims at increasing economic \ngrowth and expanding economic activity. As a part of expansionary monetary policy, the"

For example, during \na depression, the central bank buys government bonds and securities from commercial banks, paying in cash to increase their cash stock and lending capacity.\nReducing required reserve ratio: every commercial bank is required to keep with the \ncentral bank a particular percentage of its deposits or reserves in the form of cash. This \npercentage is called the “required reserve ratio (RRR)” or “cash reserve ratio (CRR)”. During a depression, the central bank lowers the CRR, thereby increasing commercial bank’s capacity to give credit.\nIf the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment, with output below \npotential GDP, expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP. Figure 4.3 below illustrates this situation. This example uses a short-run upward-\nsloping Keynesian aggregate supply curve (SRAS). The original equilibrium during a recession of E\n0 occurs at an output level of 600. An expansionary monetary policy will \nreduce interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption spending, causing the original aggregate demand curve (AD\n0) to shift right to AD1, so that, the new equilibrium \n(E1) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700."

Contractionary monetary policy , increasing interest rates, and by slowing \nthe growth of the money supply, aims to bring inflation down. This can slow economic growth and increase unemployment but it is often necessary to cool down the economy and keep it in check.\nMajor instruments of contractionary monetary policy are discussed below.\nIncreasing the discount rate: in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation, \nthe central bank raises its rate. This raises the cost of borrowing, which discourages commercial banks from borrowing from the central bank. An increase in the bank rate forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates of interest, which makes credit costlier. As a result, the demand for loans falls. On the other hand, the high rate of interest induces households to increase their savings by restricting expenditure on consumption and discourages investment. Thus, expenditure on investment and consumption is reduced, thereby reducing the aggregate demand.\nSelling securities through open market operations: during inflation, the central bank \nsells government securities to commercial banks, which lose an equivalent amount of their cash reserves, thereby reducing their capacity to offer loans.

Consequently, there is a fall in investment and in aggregate demand.\nIncreasing the RRR: during inflation, the central bank increases the RRR, thereby \ncurtailing the lending capacity of commercial banks.\nFor example, if an economy is producing at a quantity of output above its potential GDP, \na contractionary monetary policy can reduce the inflationary pressures for a rising price level. In Figure 4.4 below, the original equilibrium (E\n0) occurs at an output of 750, which \nis above potential GDP. A contractionary monetary policy will raise the interest rate, which discourages borrowing for investment and consumption spending, and causes the original demand curve (AD\n0) to shift left to AD1, so that, the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at the \npotential GDP level of 700.\nThe two examples above suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical; that is, it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings. The National Bank should loosen monetary policy when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tighten it when inflation threatens. Of course, countercyclical policy does pose a danger of overreaction. If loose monetary policy that seeks to end a recession goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the right that it triggers inflation. If tight monetary policy that seeks to reduce inflation goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the left that a recession begins. Figure 4.5 (a) and (b)summarizes that the chain \nof effects that connect loose and tight monetary policy to changes in output and the price level."

Income policies vary from “voluntary” wage and price guidelines to mandatory controls such as price/wage freezes.\nIncome policy is the suitable complement for expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, \nin particular under conditions that reduce the space for further macroeconomic expansion.. In some developing countries, wage expansion has provd to be a more reliable source of demand expansion. A policy that maintains real wages expanding in line with productivity would provide a sustainable source of domestic demand expansion.\nIn an inflationary environment, it is possible to stabilize the price level through the \ninstruments of the income policy. Governments can take this step if restrictive fiscal and monetary policies fail to reduce the increasing price level. We can use these tools of the income policy to preserve price stability:\nDetermination of wage rates in a free market\nJust as in any market, the price of labour, the wage rate, is determined by the intersection \nof supply and demand. When the supply of labour increases, the equilibrium price falls, and when the demand for labour increases, the equilibrium price rises.\nA perfectly competitive labour market has the following characteristics: \n\tA large number of firms competing with each other to hire a specific type of labour \nto fill identical jobs.\n\tNumerous qualified people who have identical skills and independently supply \ntheir labour services.\n\t“Wage taking” behaviour, that is, neither workers nor firms exert control over the \nmarket wage, \n\tPerfect, costless information and labour mobility."

Higher relative wages attract workers away from either household production, leisure, or other labour markets and towards the labour market in which the wage is increased. This means that even though there are some workers who reduce hours of work as wage rate increase, there are still new workers who enter into the labour market looking at the higher wage rate. The vertical height of the market labour supply curve, measures the opportunity cost of employing the last labour hour. In other words, in perfectly competitive product and labour markets, labour supply curves measure marginal opportunity costs. Furthermore, in order to attract more hours to the labour market, the opportunity costs must be compensated via a higher wage rate. \nMinimum WagesA minimum wage is the lowest wage per hour that a worker may be paid as mandated by \nfederal law. In simple words, it is a legally mandated price floor on hourly wages, below which workers may not be offered or accept a job.\nMinimum wages have been defined as the minimum amount of remuneration that an \nemployer is required to pay to wage earners for the work that is performed during a given period, which cannot be reduced by collective agreement or an individual contract.\nThe purpose of minimum wages is to protect workers from unduly low pay. They help \nensure a just and equitable share of the fruits of progress to all, and a minimum living wage to all who are employed and in need of such protection. Minimum wages can also be one element of a policy to overcome poverty and reduce inequality, including between men and women, by promoting the right to equal remuneration for work of equal value."

Price ceilings and price floors are the two types of price controls. They do the opposite thing, as their names suggest. A price ceiling puts a limit on the cost that one has to pay or that one can charge for something; it sets a maximum cost, keeping prices from rising above a certain level. A price floor establishes a minimum cost for something, a bottom-line benchmark. It keeps a price from falling below a particular level.\nPrice Ceiling\nA price ceiling is the mandated maximum amount that a seller is allowed to charge for a \nproduct or service. Usually set by law, price ceilings are typically applied to staples such as food and energy products when such goods become unaffordable to regular consumers. A price ceiling is a maximum legal price below the equilibrium price. It provides perverse incentives (unintended consequence), causing a shortage (see Figure 4.7).\nPrice Floor\nA price floor is a government- or group-imposed price control or limit on how low a price \ncan be charged for a product, good, commodity, or service. A price floor must be higher than the equilibrium price in order to be effective. An example of a price floor is minimum wage laws, where the government sets out the minimum hourly rate that can be paid for labour."

With resale price maintenance, a manufacturer and its distributors agree that the distributors will sell the manufacturer’s product at certain prices (resale price maintenance), at or above a price floor (minimum resale price maintenance).\nA price floor which is set above the market equilibrium price has several side-effects. \nConsumers find that they must now pay a higher price for the same product. As a result, they reduce their purchases, switch to substitutes (e.g., from butter to margarine) or drop out of the market entirely. Meanwhile, suppliers find that they are guaranteed a new, higher price than they were charging before, but with fewer willing buyers.\nTaken together, these effects mean that there is now an excess supply (known as a \n“surplus”) of the product in the market to maintain the price floor over the long term. The equilibrium price is determined when the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. Furthermore, the effect of mandating a higher price transfers some of the consumer surplus to producer surplus, while creating a deadweight loss as the price moves upward from the equilibrium price. A price floor may lead to market failure if the market is not able to allocate scarce resources in an efficient manner (see Figure 4.8)."

A large-scale example of a common \ncurrency is the decision by 17 European Nations—including some very large economies such as France, Germany, and Italy to replace their former currencies with the Euro. With these exceptions, most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling, buying, hiring, borrowing, travelling, or investing across national borders. We call the market in which people or firms use one currency to purchase another currency, the foreign exchange market. Exchange rate policy is concerned with how the \nvalue of the domestic currency, relative to other currencies, is determined. \nAn exchange rate is nothing more than a price, that is the price of one currency in terms \nof another currency and so we can analyse it with the tools of supply and demand. The formula for calculating exchange rates is: Starting amount (original currency) / Ending amount (new currency) = Exchange rate. For example, if you exchange 1 U.S. Dollars for 30 Birrs, the exchange rate would be 0.033, but if you exchange 30 Birr for 1 U.S. dollars, the exchange rate would be 30.\nIn foreign exchange markets, demand and supply are closely interrelated. This is because a \nperson or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency and vice versa. To get a sense of this, it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market: (1) firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services; (2) tourists visiting other countries; (3) international investors buying ownership (or part ownership) of a foreign firm; (4) international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership.\nFirms that buy and sell in international markets find that their costs for workers, suppliers, \nand investors are measured in the currency of the nation in which their production occurs, but their revenues from sales are measured in the currency of the different nations in which their sales took place. Thus, an Ethiopians firm exporting abroad will earn some other currency, say US dollars, but will need Ethiopian Birr to pay the workers, suppliers, and investors who are based in Ethiopia. In the foreign exchange markets, this firm will be a supplier of US. dollars and a demander of Ethiopia Birr.\nInternational tourists will supply their home currency to receive the currency of the \ncountry that they are visiting. For example, an American tourist who is visiting Ethiopia will supply US dollars into the foreign exchange market and demand Ethiopian Birr."

Namely: fixed and flexible exchange rate \npolicies. Each of them is discussed below. \na)Fixed Exchange Rate Policy\nExchange rate is determined by the government’s political and economic decisions. There are some problems which are associated with this policy. An example is the creation of a parallel market (also known as aa “black market”). Governments use fixed exchange rate systems to accomplish various goals. For example, an undervalued exchange rate acts as an import tax and an export subsidy. Fixing the exchange rate at an artificially low level promotes domestic industries by encouraging exports and discouraging imports. It can also hurt other industries by increasing the price of imported inputs. An overvalued exchange rate has the opposite effect, acting as an import subsidy and an export tax. Fixing the exchange rate at an artificially high level, benefits domestic consumers by encouraging imports and discouraging exports, through decreasing the price of imported inputs.\nFluctuation in exchange rate under fixed exchange rate policy:\n\tDevaluation: an increase in the exchange rates due to political and economic \ndecisions of the government.\n\tRevaluation: a decrease in exchange rate due to political and economic \ndecisions of the government.\nb)Flexible/Floating Exchange Rate Policy\nExchange rate determination is left for market forces. A flexible/floating exchange rate is \na regime where the currency price of a nation is set by the foreign exchange market based on supply and demand relative to other currencies.\nFluctuation in the exchange rate under flexible exchange rate policy:\n\tDepreciation: an increase in exchange rate due to market forces.\n\tAppreciation: a decrease in exchange rate due to market forces.\nThe exchange rate under a floating exchange rate policy is determined by the supply and demand for foreign currencies (see Figure 4.9 below)."

Given an appreciation of a currency, foreigners find exports more expensive while residents find imports cheaper. All else being equal, an appreciation raises the relative price of the country’s exports and decreases the relative price of its imports. Depreciation has the opposite effect.\nKey Factors that Affect Foreign Exchange RatesThe foreign exchange rate is one of the most important means through which a country’s relative level of economic health is determined. A country’s foreign exchange rate also provides a window to its economic stability, which is why it is constantly watched and analysed. If you are thinking of sending or receiving money from overseas, you need to keep a keen eye on the currency exchange rates.\nThe exchange rate is defined as “the rate at which one country’s currency may be converted \ninto another”. It may fluctuate daily with the changing market forces of supply and demand of currencies from one country to another. For these reasons, when sending or receiving money internationally, it is also important to understand what determines exchange rates.\nInflation rates: changes in market inflation cause changes in currency exchange rates.

The prices of goods and services increase at a slower rate where the inflation is low. A country with a consistently lower inflation rate exhibits a rising currency value while a country with higher inflation typically sees depreciation in its currency and is usually accompanied by higher interest rates.\nInterest rates: changes in the interest rate affect currency value and dollar exchange rate. \nForeign exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation are all correlated. Increases in interest rates cause a country‘s currency to appreciate because higher interest rates provide higher rates to lenders, thereby attracting more foreign capital, which causes a rise in exchange rates.\nBalance of payments: a country’s current account reflects the balance of trade and earnings \non foreign investment. It consists of the total number of transactions including its exports, \nimports, debt, etc. A deficit in the current account due to spending more of its currency on importing products than its earning through sale of exports causes depreciation. \nGovernment debt: this is public debt or national debt that is owned by the central \ngovernment. A country with government debt is less likely to acquire foreign capital, \nleading to inflation. Foreign investors will sell their bonds in the open market if the market predicts government debt within a certain country. As a result, a decrease in the value of its exchange rate will follow.\nTerms of trade: related to current accounts and balance of payments, the terms of trade is \nthe ratio of export prices to import prices. A country’s terms of trade improves if its export’ prices rise at a greater rate than its imports prices. This results in higher revenue, which causes a higher demand for the country’s currency and an increase in its currency’s value. This in its turn results in an appreciation of the exchange rate.\nPolitical stability and performance: a country’s political state and economic performance \ncan affect its currency strength. For example, a country with less of political turmoil is more attractive to foreign investors, so, drawing investment away from other countries with more political and economic stability. An increase in foreign capital, in its turn leads to an appreciation in the value of its domestic currency. A country with sound financial and trade policy does not give any room for uncertainty in the value of its currency. However, a country prone to political unrest may see depreciation in exchange rates.\nRecession: when a country experiences a recession, its interest rates are likely to fall,"

For this reason, its currency weakens in \ncomparison to that of other countries, therefore lowering the exchange rate.\nSpeculation: if a country’s currency value is expected to rise, investors will demand more \nof that currency in order to make a profit in the near future. Thus, the value of the currency will rise due to the increase in demand. With this increase in currency value comes a rise in the exchange rate as well.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Fixed Exchange Rate Systems\nAdvantages of fixed exchange rates\n\tCertainty - with a fixed exchange rate, firms will always know the exchange rate \nwhich makes trade and investment less risky.\n\tAbsence of speculation - with a fixed exchange rate, there will be no speculation \nif people believe that the rate will stay fixed with no revaluation or devaluation.\n\tConstraint on government policy  - if the exchange rate is fixed, then the \ngovernment may be unable to pursue extreme or irresponsible macro-economic \npolicies as these would cause a run on the foreign exchange reserves and this would be unsustainable in the medium-term.\nDisadvantages of fixed exchange rates\n\tThe economy may be unable to respond to shocks  - a fixed exchange rate means \nthat there may be no mechanism for the government to respond rapidly to balance of payments crises.\n\tProblems with reserves  - fixed exchange rate systems require large foreign \nexchange reserves and there can be international liquidity problems as a result.\n\tSpeculation - if foreign exchange markets believe that there may be a revaluation \nor devaluation, then there may be a run of speculation.

Investment and trade may be adversely affected.\n\tNo constraints on domestic policy - governments may be free to pursue \ninappropriate domestic policies (e.g. excessively expansionary policies) as the exchange rate will not act as a constraint.\n\tSpeculation - the existence of speculation can lead to exchange rate changes that \nare unrelated to the underlying pattern of trade. This will also cause instability and uncertainty for firms and consumers.\nExchange Rate Structure in Ethiopia\nThe legal currency of Ethiopia (Birr) was first introduced in 1945 with an official exchange \nrate of Birr 2.48 per US dollar with a value of 0.36 grams of fine gold. The linkage with fine gold was in accordance with the monetary system established by the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 which established the exchange rate between the national currency and other currencies with the same arrangement. This fixed exchange rate was under operation for almost two decades. On 1 January 1964 the Ethiopian Birr was slightly devalued to 2.50 birr per US dollar. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods System in 1971, the Ethiopian dollar was revalued to 2.30 birr per US dollar on 21 December 1971. The"

It was again revalued to 2.07 Ethiopian Birr per US dollar in February 1973. From then on, the Ethiopian currency was pegged to the US dollar at the rate of 2.07 Birr per dollar until massive devaluation in October 1992. \nFollowing the overthrown of the Derg Regime, EPRDF introduced the auction-based \nexchange rate determination scheme and the interbank money market. Additionally, the principle of gradualism in liberalization of exchange rate market is at the heart of this policy development. The exchange rate reform was started by devaluing the currency, which had been fixed for about two decades to 2.07 Birr per US dollar, by 140% to 5 birr per US dollar in October 1992. In 1993 the NBE introduced the auction-based exchange rate system. It was conducted on a fortnightly basis and took the form of discriminatory price which clears the market for the coming two weeks. The supply of funds for this market was obtained from export earnings, loans and grants. The auction-based exchange rate system was initially worked side by side with the official exchange rate. Before the unification of official exchange rate and auction-based exchange rate systems in August 1995, the official exchange rate was used for imports of fertilizer, petroleum, pharmaceutical products, Ethiopia’s contribution to international organizations and external debt service payments. In July 1996 the NBE introduced a weekly auction replacing the previous auction system. The NBE also replaced the retail auction system by a wholesale auction system where banks are considered as wholesale bidders.\nIn 1998, the NBE issued directives aimed at establishing interbank foreign exchange and \nmoney markets. The interbank foreign exchange market is a wholesale market, where the amount traded is large and the spread between buying and selling rates is narrower than the normal situation for commercial transactions. It is an exclusive market for banks to trade foreign exchange with each other. The establishment of this market is primarily motivated by the recognition that the foreign exchange supply by NBE through the auction system is not sufficient to satisfy the demand of banks. Currently, the exchange rate is determined through an interbank foreign exchange market on a daily basis, a clear indication of the government’s policy of gradualism toward liberalizing the exchange rate market."

The devaluation of the Birr in 2010 was followed by the rise in inflation of about 33% in 2011 (after one year of currency devaluation). This type of relationship between exchange rate change and change in inflation tells us that inflation in Ethiopia responds positively to devaluation. The Birr continued to depreciate but at a very slow rate and it reached 18.19/US$ October 2012/13. This gradual depreciation is in line with the goal to enhance the competitiveness of Ethiopian exports and attract foreign direct investment. The average exchange rate of Birr against US dollar in the official market showed an annual depreciation of 5.4% since 2011/12. In January 2014, the exchange rate reached 19.107 Birr/US$, a 4.85% depreciation since January 2013.\nThe fluctuation in commodity prices in international markets and the strength of US \ndollar relative to other currencies, led to the decline of Ethiopia’s export commodities, especially coffee, oilseed, gold, and leather. The World Bank suggested that the Ethiopian government should devalue its currency by at least 10%, pointing out that in real terms it may lead to a 5% increase in export earnings and 2% increase in growth. As a result, on October 10, 2017, the NBE devalued the Birr by 15% against international currencies (National Bank of Ethiopia, 2017). According to the government, the devaluation was"

To achieve these objectives, different types of macroeconomic policies, such as, fiscal, monetary, income, and foreign exchange policies are adopted. Expansionary policies  are adopted in the situation of \ndeficient demand, whereas contractionary policies  are adopted in the situation of excess \ndemand.\nFiscal policy is the expenditure and revenue (tax) policy of the government to achieve the \ndesired objectives. It can be expansionary or contractionary depending upon prevailing economic conditions. The instruments of expansionary fiscal policies are an increase in government expenditure and a reduction in tax rates; and the instruments of contractionary fiscal policies are a reduction in government expenditure and an increase in tax rates.\nMonetary policy is what a government, National Bank, or monetary authority of a country \nuses to control the supply of money and the cost of money (rate of interest). Similar to fiscal policy, monetary policy can also be expansionary or contractionary depending upon prevailing economic conditions. The instruments of expansionary monetary policy are: a reduction in the bank rate (discount rate), buying of securities by the central bank and"

On the other hand, the instruments of contractionary \nmonetary policies are increase in discount rate, selling of securities by the central bank and an increase in required reserve ratio.\nIncome policies are wage and price controls which usually seek to establish wages \nand prices that are below free market level. Minimum wages have been defined as the minimum amount of remuneration that an employer is required to pay wage earners for the work performed during a given period, which cannot be reduced by collective agreement or an individual contract. A price floor is a minimum price at which a product \nor service is permitted to sell. Many agricultural goods have price floors imposed by the government.

The term “compulsory” indicates that taxes are not voluntary purchase payments but mandatory impositions, payable in line with what is legislated. To enforce the compulsion, different governments have constitutions, proclamations, regulations and directives to charge tax for different categories of people. The term “unrequited” is used in the sense that benefits provided by government to a taxpayer are not in proportion to the payments made by that taxpayer. In other words, obtaining direct benefit is not the main condition of paying tax. Hence tax is levied without a quid pro quo, i.e. without anything in direct return.\nIndicating the inevitability of taxation, it is said that there are two things that are certain in life: death and taxes. It is also said that without tax, there will be no revenue , and hence, \nno government. However, taxation is not the only source of government revenue; there are other sources such as borrowing, imposition of fees for services rendered, or printing money. Nevertheless, taxation typically accounts for 90% or more of total governmental receipts in times of peace.\nIn minimalist terms, governments impose taxes for three basic purposes: to cover the \ncost of administration, to maintain law and order and to defend the public. They also impose taxes to raise revenue to fund economic infrastructure, health facilities, transport,"

The following terms are widely used.Tax rate is the per-unit amount of the tax or the percentage rate at which the economic \nactivity is taxed.\nTax base is the level or quantity of an economic activity that is taxed. Higher tax rates \nreduce the level of the tax base because they make the activity less attractive.\nTax incidence relates to the way the burden of a tax is distributed among economic units \n(consumers, producers, employees, employers). It points out who is legally responsible for paying the tax. It is said that taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society; the question is who pays? Taxes are almost always levied in a way that a particular person or firm should pay the tax. The incidence of a tax is determined by looking to see who is made worse off by the tax and by how much. It is also known as “tax incidence analysis”. Through tax incidence analysis, we can trace and identify the final tax burden distribution. Though taxes may be collected from firms, the ultimate burden may fall on individual consumers. Incidence of tax is defined as its final resting place.\nImpact of tax is tax’s first point of contact with the taxpayers. It is felt by those who bear \nthe first statutory responsibility of paying it to the government. \nEffect of a tax refers to responses from taxpayers and the economy to the imposition and \ncollection of taxes. Such responses can be of great variety and influence the working of the economy in terms of production, growth, saving, investment, inequality etc.\n5.1.2 Objectives of Taxation\nGovernments impose taxes to achieve several important macroeconomic and social goals. Accordingly, the objectives of taxation are to: \na)minimize income and wealth inequalities. \nb)stabilize the economy.\nc)discourage the consumption of harmful products."

The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the \ngovernment, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. \n2. The tax which everyone is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary. The \ntime of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor, and to every other person.\n3.Every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner that makes it the most convenient for the contributor to pay it.\n4.Every tax ought to be planned) in manner it takes as little as possible out of the pockets of the people, over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state.\n5. Every tax has a cost of collection. It is important that the cost of collection should \nbe the minimum possible. This is called the “canon/principle of economy”.\n6. The tax system should be able to yield enough revenue for the government so that \nit should not be forced to resort to deficit financing. This is called the “canon of fiscal adequacy”.\nThese classical maxims can be translated to modern principles of taxation. According to these principles, a tax system should not distort the optimal allocation of production"

In sum, the principles of taxation touch on issues of equity or fairness, certainty, convenience, economy, flexibility, simplicity, diversity, and buoyancy.\n5.1.4 Characteristics of a Good Tax System\nTaxation is broadly characterised by the compulsory nature whereby it imposes obligations on taxpayers. It cannot be escaped, which means a non-payment is a criminal offense. Moreover, revenues from taxation are supposed to be spent on collective use, thus serving a common interest where both payers and non-payers will benefit. Taxation is also paid on regular and periodic basis with known due dates. Finally, tax is levied on all people without discrimination, yet according to their ability to pay. \nA good tax system is characterised by the following features:\na)simple, financially adequate and elastic.\nb)broad based - tax is levied not only on income but also on property and commodities.\nc)administratively efficient.\nd)balanced and harmonious.\ne)ensures the reduction of economic inequalities.\nf)ensuring economic stability.\ng)ensures that national income or standard of living is increases.\nh)acts as an instrument of economic growth.\ni)is socially advantageous.\nj) enables optimum allocation of resources.\nIn addition, the revenue yield should be adequate; the distribution of the tax burden \nshould be equitable. Moreover, taxes should be chosen so as to minimize interference with economic decisions in otherwise efficient markets. The tax system should also permit fair and non-arbitrary administration and should be understandable to the taxpayer. The tax structure should facilitate the use of fiscal policy for stabilization and growth objectives. These and other requirements may be used as criteria to appraise the quality of a good tax structure. Eventually, a good tax system should not only be equitable, but it should also be efficient."

They are direct and \nindirect taxes. Direct taxes impose the burden or impact and incidence on the same person \nwho earns the income. They are computed based on the ability of the taxpayer to pay, which means that the higher the person’s capability of paying, the higher the taxes. Examples of direct taxes include employee’s income tax, business income tax, rental income tax, agricultural income tax and other income taxes, poll tax, land tax, property tax, royalty tax, capital gain tax, property tax, gift tax and inheritance tax. Here, the tax paying ability is assessed directly in relation to one’s income. \nDirect taxes are further divided into income tax, transfer tax, entitlement tax, property tax \nand capital gains tax.\ni. Income tax: the type of tax that governments impose on income generated by individuals and businesses within their jurisdiction.\nii. Transfer tax: the most common form of transfer tax is levied on real estate. Such \na tax is levied on the taxable portion of the property of a deceased individual including trusts and financial accounts.\niii. Property tax: this tax is charged on properties such as land and building and is used for maintaining public service.\niv. Capital gains tax: this tax is charged when an individual sells assets such as stocks real estate, or a business. This kind of tax is computed by acquisition amount and the selling amount.\nIndirect taxes impose the impact (immediate burden) and incidence (ultimate burden) on different persons. Examples of indirect taxes include consumption taxes such as value added tax (V AT), excise tax, turnover tax (TOT), surtax, customs duty, and stamp duty.\n5.1.6 Major Categories and Sources of Taxes\nDifferent countries have different names to classify their tax systems. In Ethiopia, for example, taxes are classified as Schedules that include income from employment, income from rental of buildings, income from business, and other incomes. This is explained in detail in this unit.\nIn the case of the UK, during the time of preparing this book, the main types of taxes are:"

The main purposes of imposing sin taxes are to reduce the consumption of harmful goods and to increase government revenue.\nIn the USA, there are five most common types of taxes. They are:\n1. earnings (payroll tax).\n2. individual income, (individual income tax, capital gains).3. corporate income (corporate income tax). 4. wealth (property taxes, estate taxes).5. consumption (consumption tax, sales taxes, excise tax).\nFrom this list, items 1-4 are direct taxes and item 5 represents indirect ta. In terms of the \nshare of tax sources, the US Federal Government generates tax revenue from individual income tax (41.6%) and payroll taxes (34.8%), corporate income tax (15.1%), with very small shares from consumption and other taxes (such as wealth taxes ( Gruber, 2015).\n Activity 5.1\nUse reference texts such as library books or Internet (e.g. Google search) to compare and contrast tax structures in a country in Africa, Latin \nAmerica and South Asia."

Discuss this with a \npartner sitting next to you and report what you have discussed to \nthe class.\nThere are two approaches for tax equity: the benefits approach and the ability to pay approach. \n5.2.1 The Benefits Approach\nAccording to the benefits approach, an equitable tax system is one in which each tax payer contributes in line with the benefits which he/she receives from public services. In other words, it is a principle for distributing the tax load among individuals and groups indicating that tax obligations should be based on the benefits received from the enjoyment of public services. Here, the aim is to work out how much each person gains from public spending.\nThe benefits approach has the advantage of linking the discussion of tax equity with the \nexpenditure side of the public budget. However, it is much easier to state an abstract basis than to apply it in a real situation. The reason for this lies in the fact that while some types of government spending such as health, education, and social subsidies can easily be attributed to beneficiary households, about half of government spending may not be so allocated. It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine who benefits most from spending on such items as the army, police, diplomatic service, or the judicial system.\n5.2.2 The Ability-to-pay Approach\nAccording to this approach, tax is levied on each taxpayer in line with his/her ability to"

In this approach, taxes \nshould be distributed as per the capacity of taxpayers to pay them. Taxation based on ability-to-pay calls for people with equal capacity to pay the same and for people with greater ability, to pay more. The key questions here are how to measure ability to pay, how to determine a fair set of tax rates based on differing abilities to pay and how to compare the economic status of various individual taxpayers.\nThe ability to-pay approach is based on horizontal equity and vertical equity. Horizontal \nequity is a situation where people in the same circumstances pay the same taxes. Vertical \nequity, on the other hand, is a situation where a degree of proportionality is important whereby unequals should be treated unequally. \nThe concepts of progressive, proportional, and regressive taxes help address this issue, \nalso known as “type by impact.” ( Greenlaw and Taylor, 2017).\nAccordingly, a progressive tax is one where those with higher incomes pay a higher share \nof taxes out of their income compared to those with lower incomes. That is, the average tax rate rises with income and people with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.\nA proportional tax is one where everyone pays the same share of taxes regardless of \nincome level. Here, the average tax rate is the same at all income levels. Put simply, \neveryone pays the same percentage of income in taxes.\nA regressive tax is one where those with high income pay a lower share of income in taxes \nthan those with lower incomes. Here, the average tax rate falls when income rises. People \nwith higher incomes will pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes.\nIn connection with the ability to pay approach, one may ask: How is the ability to \npay measured? Or what tax base better represents ability to pay (or taxable capacity \nof individuals)?  Ideally, the measure for ability to pay would reflect the entire welfare \nwhich a person can derive from all options available to him/her including consumption \n(present and future), holding of wealth, and the enjoyment of leisure. Unfortunately, such a comprehensive measure is not practicable."

The MoR prepares decrees, directives and regulations on fiscal policy matters and submits them for parliament to legislate. As a federal country, the Ethiopian constitution allows for the revenue sharing principle of federal and regional governments.\nThe legal framework for taxation is provided by Proclamation No. 33/1992 and the \nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE) Constitution (1995) that promulgated \nthe sharing of revenue between the federal and regional governments.

The list also \nincludes tax related legal provisions in Ethiopia.\nValue added tax (V AT): is a tax levied on the value added at different stages. It is a \nsales tax that is administered in a different form. It is an indirect tax. Ethiopia introduced \nthe V AT Act on 1 January 2003 with the standard rate of 15% which is applied on every taxable transaction by a registered person. According to the law, V AT must be included in the selling price of every taxable supply of goods or services made by a vendor during that vendor’s enterprise. A vendor is a person who is registered, or required to be registered for V AT. Thus, V AT is a destination-based or consumption tax, which means that only the consumption of goods and services is taxed.\nV AT exemptions also apply whereby the supplier of goods does not levy V AT (output \ntax) on those exempt supplies but must bear V AT (input tax) on the purchases incurred in making such supplies.\nTurnover tax (TOT): this is an equalization tax that is imposed on persons not registered \nfor value-added tax to fulfil their obligations and to enhance fairness in commercial \nrelations and to complete the coverage of the tax system. Administrative feasibility considerations limit the registration of persons under the value-added tax to those with annual transactions to the total value exceeding 500,000 Bir. For services rendered locally, the rate is 2% on contractors, grain mills, tractors and combine harvesters, 10% on others as provided by the Excise Tax Proclamation No. 307/2002 .\nExcise tax; this is imposed and payable on selected goods such as, luxury items and \nbasic goods which are demand inelastic. In addition, it is believed that imposing the tax on goods that are hazardous to health and which cause social problems will reduce the consumption. Excise tax is applicable on 19 groups of items and 378 goods. The tax rate ranges from 5% to 500%. In terms of the time of payment, tax on excisable goods is payable when imported at the time of clearing the goods from the customs area, and when produced locally, not later than 30 days from the date of production ( EIC, 2020).\nSurtax: it is an additional 10% tax that is applicable on imported goods except for \nfertilizers, petroleum and lubricants, motor vehicles for freight, passengers and special purpose motor vehicles, aircraft, spacecraft, and parts thereof, and capital (investment) goods. The Ministry of Finance is authorized to increase or decrease the list of goods exempt from surtax."

Both problems cause taxpayers to incur costs to correctly calculate their tax liability. This may encourage the growth of unreported transactions in the underground economy (tax evasion) and the growth of demand for tax shelters (tax avoidance). \nIn developed countries, one of the tools for improving efficiency in tax administration is to \nmodernize customer services. This activity is based on the recognition of new management techniques with new concepts of “client orientation” or “customer orientation”. \nIn developing countries including Ethiopia, on the other hand, tax systems face diverse \nproblems. Some of these include the complexity of the tax system, perception of corruption, the cost of compliance, fairness perception of the tax system as well as tax knowledge. The latter has a positive effect on voluntary tax compliance. Broadly, these problems can be categorised under tax compliance and bureaucracy in tax systems.\nProblems that are related to tax compliance are the biggest problems which are faced \nby any tax administration. The term “tax compliance” refers to the degree to which the taxpayers with the tax laws. On the contrary, tax non-compliance takes the form of tax avoidance and tax evasion. \nTax avoidance refers to arranging one’s affairs so as to minimize the tax burden. It entails \ntaking full advantage of the provisions of the tax code or schedule to reduce one’s tax obligations. An example is a reduction of one’s tax burden through exemptions, deductions or incentives approved in the tax schedule. From the perspective of law, tax avoidance is not illegal; however, it poses problems for tax administration. \nTax evasion is falsifying information on a tax return in order to reduce one’s tax liability \nor even not filing at all (failing to pay legally due taxes) which is illegal.

Household A lives in a \nrural community. It has 6 members, including a husband and wife, 1 hectare farm, \ngrows 5-6 crops, and has fruit trees, 3 cows, 5 chickens, and various pieces of farm equipment. The members of the household consume part of what it produces and sells the surplus. They have access to health clinics, schools and rural market.. \nHousehold B lives in the slums which are close to a major regional city. It has 5 members. \nThe household head does not have a regular income. They barely have enough for accommodation or feeding themselves. Only 1 child goes to school. \nThink of being member of one of the households. What do you think of your wellbeing? \nHow do you compare yourself with others? What do you think about the type of poverty the household experiences?\nTo learn the meaning of poverty, it is useful to start by understating what poor people think and say about their circumstances. The following quotes represent the voices of the poor:\n“When one is poor, she has no say in public, she feels inferior. She has no food, so there is famine in her house; no clothing, and no progress in her family.” A poor woman from Uganda\n“…low salaries and lack of jobs. And it’ s not having medicine, food, and \nclothes.” A discussion group in Brazil.\n“Life in the area is so precarious that the youth and every able person has"

They indicate that poverty is multidimensional. At least six dimensions feature prominently in poor people’s definition of poverty (Nafziger, 2006, pp.163-64).\nFirst, poverty consists of many interlocked dimensions. Although poverty is rarely about \nthe lack of only one thing, the bottom line is always hunger – the lack of food. Second, poverty has important psychological dimensions, such as powerlessness, voicelessness, dependency, shame, and humiliation. The maintenance of cultural identity and social norms of solidarity helps poor people to continue to believe in their own humanity, despite inhumane conditions. Third, poor people lack access to basic infrastructure – roads (particularly in rural areas), transportation, and clean water. Fourth, while there is a widespread thirst for literacy, schooling receives little mention or mixed reviews. Poor people realize that education offers an escape from poverty – but only if the economic environment in the society at large and the quality of education improves. Fifth, poor health and illness are dreaded almost everywhere as a source of destitution. This is related to the costs of health care as well as to income lost due to illness. Finally, the poor rarely speak of income, but focus instead on managing assets – physical, human, social, and environmental – as a way to cope with their vulnerability. In many areas, this vulnerability has a gender dimension.\nApart from the perception of the poor about their conditions, development discourse \ntoo defines and describes poverty in several ways. Poverty is a widely used term; it encompasses both income and non-income dimensions of deprivation, including lack of income and other material means, lack of access to basic social services such as education, health, and safe water, lack of personal security, and lack of empowerment to participate in the political process and in decisions that influence someone’s life. \nThe World Bank (2000) defines poverty as “the pronounced deprivation in wellbeing”. \nWellbeing is seen from three angles. First, the conventional view perceives wellbeing as linked to command over commodities. The poor are those who do not have enough income or consumption to put them above some adequate minimum threshold. This view sees poverty largely in monetary terms. Second, poverty is tied to a specific type"

            "text": "6.1 Concept of Poverty and Its Measurement 124Grade 12 Economics Student Textbook\nof consumption (people could be house poor, food poor or health poor). Third, the broad \napproach to wellbeing focuses on the capability of the individual to function in society. Poor people often lack key capabilities. This means that they may have inadequate income or education, or be in poor health, or feel powerless, or lack political freedoms ( Haughton\nand Khandker, 2009).\nIrrespective of divergent views on the definitions of poverty, there is convergence of \nthinking on the types of poverty, as explained below.\n6.1.2 Types of Poverty\nPoverty is classified into relative and absolute poverty. Relative poverty is defined in \ncomparison to other people’s standing in the economy. A person can be poor in the relative sense, although he/she can meet his/her basic needs. Relative poverty can be observed by looking at relative standings within a society, or internationally. For example, one can think of relative poverty of some groups of people in rich countries compared to other groups. Relative poverty is, sometimes, seen as a phenomenon most relevant in societies in which there is no acute problem with absolute poverty. \nAbsolute poverty is the situation of someone being unable or only barely able to meet the \nsubsistence essentials such as food, clothing, and shelter. It is simply the deprivation of \nbasic needs. The extent of absolute poverty is expressed by the number of people who are unable to command sufficient resources to satisfy the basic needs. They are counted as the total number living below a specified minimum level of real income or an international poverty line such as those living on less than $1.25 a day or $2 per day in purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars. \nAbsolute poverty is seen as a failure of meeting the requirements of basic dignity of human \nbeings or even a failure to meet human rights, while relative poverty is seen as a matter of failure of distributive justice.\nApart from relative and absolute aspects of poverty, there are also other dimensions. It \nis argued that perhaps the most valid generalizations about the poor are that they are disproportionately located in rural areas, that they are primarily engaged in agricultural and associated activities, that they are more likely to be women and children than adult males, and that they are often concentrated among minority ethnic groups and indigenous peoples. These generalisations are supported by empirical data from a broad cross section"

On average, about 80% of all target \npoverty groups are located in the rural areas in Africa and Asia, and the percentage for \nLatin America is about 50%.\n6.1.3 Measuring Poverty\nLet’s start the measurement of poverty by answering why we need to measure poverty. There are four reasons to measure poverty. The first is to keep poor people on the agenda. The second is to be able to identify poor people and so that we are able to target appropriate interventions. The third is to monitor and evaluate projects and policy interventions geared to poor people. The fourth is to evaluate the effectiveness of institutions whose goal is to help poor people.\nOnce the reasons for measuring poverty are clear, the next step is to list the three steps \nneeded to measure poverty. They are: \n1. defining an indicator of welfare. \n2.establishing a minimum acceptable standard of that indicator to separate the poor \nfrom the non-poor (the poverty line). \n3.generating a summary statistic to aggregate the information from the distribution of this welfare indicator relative to the poverty line ( Haughton and Khandker, \n2009).\nPoverty is measured in a number of steps. The first step is to know which people are poor. This follows with specifying a minimal socially acceptable level of income or consumption (the poverty line). The second is to implement a representative survey in which the corresponding income or consumption concept is measured. Finally, one has to choose and calculate a specific poverty measure. The most common implementation of these steps is to have a fixed, monetary, consumption-based threshold for poverty, with data coming from a household survey, and poverty measured as the percentage of individuals with per capita consumption below the poverty line ( Hughton and Khandker, 2009).\nThere are different ways of measuring poverty. One measurement is called the poverty \nheadcount index. Assume a headcount (H) of those whose incomes or consumption fall below the absolute poverty line (Y\np) whereby the headcount is taken as a fraction of the \ntotal population (N). Then, headcount index or headcount ratio can be defined as H/N. The idea is to set this level at a standard below which we would consider a person to live in"

            "text": "6.1 Concept of Poverty and Its Measurement 126Grade 12 Economics Student Textbook\nabsolute human misery such that the person’s health is in jeopardy (Todaro and Smith, \n2015).\nAnother measure is what is known as a total poverty gap (TPG). This measures the total \namount of income that is necessary to raise everyone who is below the poverty line up \nto that line. It is defined as the sum of the difference between the poverty line and actual income levels of all people who are living below that line. Similarly, the average poverty gap (APG) is found by dividing the TPG by the total population.\nThe Foster-Greer-Thorbecke index is another measurement. It is defined as a class \nof measures of the level of absolute poverty. This measurement helps to understand the \ndegree of income inequality among the poor ( Todaro and Smith, 2015).\nThe aforementioned are unidimensional measures which are based on income. There are also other composite or multidimensional poverty measures.\nThe Multidimensional Poverty index (MPI) is the most prominent application of \nmultidimensional poverty measurement; it incorporates three dimensions at the household \nlevel: health, education, and wealth. The MPI takes into account that people suffer from multiple deprivations.\nIn 2010, the UNDP used the MPI by building up the index from the household level. It \nused the three dimensions (health, education, and standard of living) and each of their corresponding indicators because they reflect problems which are often mentioned by the poor, and they have been long considered important by the development community. Moreover, they are well established philosophically as human rights or basic needs.\nEach of the dimensions has its own indicator. For example, health has two indicators: a) \nwhether any child has died in the family, and b) whether any adult or child in the family is malnourished. Both are weighted equally, and each counts one-sixth toward the maximum possible deprivation in the MPI. \nEducation, too, has two indicators: a) whether or not even one household member has \ncompleted five years of schooling, and b) whether or not any school-age child is out of school for grades one through to eight. Again, both are given equal weight, and each counts one-sixth towards the MPI. \nFinally, in terms of standard of living, equal weight is placed on six deprivations: a) lack \nof electricity, b) insufficiently safe drinking water, c) inadequate sanitation, d) inadequate"

To fill this gap, Sabina Alkire and James have extended the FGT index (mentioned above) to multiple dimensions. In the multidimensional poverty approach, a poor person is identified to be multidimentionally poor through what is called the “dual cut-off method”: first, the cut-off levels within each of the dimensions (analogous to falling below a poverty line such as $1.25 per day if income poverty were being addressed) and second, the cut-off of the number of dimensions in which a person must be deprived (below the line). \n6.1.4 Sen’s Approach to Poverty and Wellbeing\nAmartya Sen, the 1998 Nobel Laureate in economics, contended that traditional welfare economics, which stresses the revealed preferences or desire-based utilities of individuals in their acts of choice, lacks enough information about people’s preferences to assess the social good. Accordingly, as an alternative, Sen’s welfare theory relies not on individuals’ attainments (for example, of basic needs) but individuals’ capabilities. \nHis approach, also known as capability approach, states that income and wealth are \nnot ends in themselves but rather instruments for other purposes. For him capability to \nfunction is what really matters for one’s status as a poor or non-poor person. According to him, the expansion of commodity production is valued not for its own sake, but as a means to human welfare and freedom.\nIn effect, Sen argued that poverty is not low wellbeing but the inability to pursue wellbeing \nbecause of the lack of economic means. Hence, poverty cannot be properly measured by income or even by utility as conventionally understood. What matters is not the things that a person has but what a person is, or can be, and does, or can do. What matters \nfor wellbeing is not just the characteristics of commodities consumed, as in the utility approach, but what use the consumer can and does make of commodities. For example, a \nbook is of little value to an illiterate person, except perhaps as a cooking fuel.\nSen argues against relying only on the poverty percentage or headcount approach to \nmeasure poverty and deprivation, the approach pursued by the World Bank economists. To make any sense of the concept of human wellbeing in general, and poverty in particular, it is necessary to think beyond the availability of commodities and consider their use: i.e.,"

Functionings, according to Sen, are what a person does or \ncan do with the commodities of given characteristics. Sen also considered the freedom \nof choice, or control of one’s own life, as a central aspect of wellbeing. Moreover, what people have reason to value ranges from being healthy, well nourished, and well clothed, to being mobile, having self-esteem, and taking part in the life of the community.\nSen coined another term, capabilities, which literally means the power or ability to do \nsomething. Capabilities represent the real freedoms that people have to achieve their \npotential doings and beings. Whether someone can convert a set of resources and public goods into a functioning (i.e., whether one has a particular capability) depends on personal, socio-political, and environmental conditions, which are called conversion factors.\nCapabilities are thus real or substantive freedoms as they denote the freedoms that have been cleared of any potential obstacles, in contrast to mere formal rights and freedoms.\nEventually, human wellbeing means being well. In other words, it means being healthy, \nwell nourished, well clothed, literate, and long-lived, and more broadly, being able to take part in the life of the community, being mobile, and having freedom of choice in what one can become and can do. The lack of these indicates deficiency in wellbeing, and therefore poverty.\n Activity 6.1\n1.

We also have explored a different approach to human wellbeing which moves away from income alone and towards what the incomes translate into functioning and capabilities. Now, we will explore the concept of inequality which is closely related to poverty.\nInequality refers to the situation of being unequal or uneven, or a social disparity of \ndistribution or opportunity. Inequalities take different dimensions: economic, social, political, etc. For example, there are inequalities of power, prestige, status, gender, job satisfaction, conditions of work, degree of participation, freedom of choice. The focus here is on the economic (mainly income) dimension.\nEconomic inequality is the disproportionate distribution of total national income among \nhouseholds. This income distribution is divided into two: the functional/distributive factor share distribution of income and the personal/size distribution of income.\nFunctional or factor share distribution of income depicts the share of total national \nincome that each of the factors of production (land, labour, and capital) receives. The \ntheory of functional income distribution queries the percentage that labour receives as a whole and compares this with the percentages of total income distributed in the form of rent, interest, and profit (i.e., the returns to land and financial and physical capital). In other words, the concept of functional income distribution attempts to explain the incomes of factors of production by the contribution they make to production ( Todaro and Smith, \n2015).\nThe personal/size distribution of income is the most commonly used indicator of income \ndistribution. It deals with individual persons or households and the total incomes they receive regardless of the way in which they received that income. Next, we will see some of the methods of measuring income inequality."

Second, divide \nthe population into successive quintiles (fifths) or deciles (tenths) according to ascending income levels and then determine what proportion of the total national income is received by each income group. For example, take the hypothetical data in Table 6.1. In this data, 20 \nindividuals (households) representing the entire population of a given developing country are arranged in order of ascending annual personal income, ranging from the individual with the lowest income (0.8 units) to the one with the highest (15.0 units). Then, the ratio of the incomes received by the top 20% and bottom 40% of the population, sometimes called a Kuznets ratio (named after Simon Kuznets) is used as a measure of the degree of \ninequality between high-income and low-income groups in a country.\nThe total income of all individuals amounts to 100 units and is the sum of all entries in column 2. In the third column, the population is grouped into quintiles of four individuals each. That means,\n the first quintile (4 out of 20) represents the bottom 20% of the population \non the income scale. This group receives only 5% (a total of 5 money units) of the total income. The second quintile receives 9% of the total income. Alternatively, the bottom 40% of the population (quantities 1 plus 2) receives only 14% of the income while the top 20% (the fifth quintile) of the population receives 51% of the total incomes."

This ratio is often used as a measure of the degree of inequality between the two extremes; this inequality ratio is equal to 14 which is divided by 51, or approximately 0.28. \nTo provide a more detailed breakdown of the size distribution of income, decile (10%) \nshares are listed in column 4. We see, for example, that the bottom 10% of the population (the two poorest individuals) receive only 1.8% of the total income, while the top 10% (the two richest individuals) receives 28.5%.\nFinally, if you want to know what the top 5% receives, you divide the total population \ninto 20 equal groups of individuals (i.e. each of the 20 individuals) and calculate the percentage of total income that is received by the top group. This means that the top 5% or the 20\nth individual receives 15% of the total income, a higher share than the combined \nshares of the lowest 40% individuals (i.e. only14%).\nLorenz Curve as a Measure of the Distribution of Income\nAnother common way to analyse personal income statistics is to construct the Lorenz \ncurve. The Lorenz curve shows cumulative shares of income received by individuals or groups. It was developed by economist Max Lorenz in 1905 as a way to analyse personal income statistics. The Lorenz curve and Gini Index (G) measure the distribution of income. \nTo construct a Lorenz curve, we put the number of income recipients in cumulative \npercentage on the horizontal axis and the share of income received by each group (%) on the vertical axis (see Figure 6.1 below).For example, at point 20, we have the lowest (poorest) 20% of the population, at point 60 we have the bottom 60%, and at the end of the axis all 100% of the population has been accounted for."

It is also cumulative up to 100%, meaning that both axes are equally long. So, the entire figure is enclosed in a square, and a diagonal line is drawn from the lower left corner (the origin) of the square to the upper right corner.\nAt every point on that diagonal, the percentage of income received is exactly equal to the \npercentage of income recipients. For example, the point halfway along the length of the diagonal represents 50% of the income being distributed to exactly 50% of the population. \nAt the three-quartiles point of diagonal, 75% of the income would be distributed to 75% of \nthe population. In other words, the diagonal line is representative of “perfect equality” in size distribution of income. This means that each group of income recipients receives the same percentage of the total income. The bottom 40% receives 40% of the income, while the top 5% receives 5% of the total income.\nIn sum, the Lorenz Curve shows income inequalities. If income distribution were perfectly \nequal, it would be represented by the 45-degree line. In practice, Lorenz curves are located between the 45-degree line and the line of complete inequality (see Figure 6.2 below). \nThe more bowed out the curve, the less equal the distribution."

For example, countries like China made significant progress in lifting millions of their citizens out of poverty. Subsequently, the number of people living in extreme poverty declined from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015.

Indeed, sub-Saharan Africa experienced virtually no rate reduction from 1950 to 2000. The gravity of the situation led developing countries to make the eradication of poverty their policy goal. This desire is also reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals, 2015-2030. Accordingly, Goal 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms. \nThe World Bank is said to favour the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process to help countries think systematically about how the position of poor people may be improved, and to act accordingly (Hughton and Khandker, 2009).

Why do \nyou think this is the case?\nGlobally, women make up a substantial majority of the world’s poor. Among the poorest communities throughout the developing world, virtually everywhere women and children experience the harshest deprivation. They are more likely to be poor and malnourished and less likely to receive medical services, clean water, sanitation, and other benefits.\nThe prevalence of female-headed households, the lower earning capacity of women, \nand their limited control over their spouses’ income all contribute to this phenomenon. Moreover, a disproportionate number of the poorest people live in households which are headed by women who have lower incomes. A portion of the income disparity between male-headed and female-headed households can be explained by the large earnings differentials between men and women. Since the earning potential of women is considerably below that of their male counterparts, women are more likely to be among the very poor.\nIn addition, women have less access to education, formal-sector employment, social \nsecurity, and government employment programmes. These facts combine to ensure that poor women’s financial resources are meagre and unstable compared to those of men."

Similarly, rural women have less access to the resources that are necessary to generate stable incomes. Social customs and laws sometimes play a restrictive role in owning property.\nHousehold income alone fails to describe the severity of women’s relative deprivation. \nThis is because a higher proportion of female-headed households are situated in the poorest areas, which have little or no access to public services such as piped water, sanitation, and health care, so household members are more likely to fall ill and are less likely to receive medical attention. In addition, children in female-headed households are less likely to be enrolled in school and more likely to be working in order to provide additional income.\nThe degree of economic hardship may also vary widely within a household depending \non the distribution of income within the household, which may be unequal. In terms of intra-household resource allocation, there may exist a bias against females in areas such as nutrition, medical care, education, and inheritance.\nThe extent of these internal biases is strongly influenced by the economic status of women. \nStudies have found that where women’s share of income within the home is relatively high, there is less discrimination against girls, and women are better able to meet their own needs as well as those of their children. \nWhen household income is marginal, most of women’s income is contributed towards \nhousehold nutritional intake. Since this fraction is considerably smaller for men, a rise in male earnings leads to a less than proportionate increase in the funds available for the provision of daily needs. It is thus unsurprising that programs designed to increase nutrition and family health are more effective when targeting women than when targeting men.\nWomen’s control over household income and resources is limited for a number of reasons. \nOf primary importance is the fact that a relatively large proportion of the work performed by women is unremunerated, for example, collecting firewood and cooking, and may even be intangible, as with parenting. \nWomen’s control over household resources may also be constrained by the fact that many \nwomen from poor households are not paid for the work they perform in family agriculture or business. It is common for a male head of household to control all funds from cash"

These combined factors perpetuate the low economic status \nof women and can lead to strict limitations on their control over household resources.\nWhen public programmes to alleviate poverty work exclusively with men, they tend to \nexacerbate these inequalities. In urban areas, training programmes to increase earning potential and formal-sector employment are generally geared to men, while agricultural extension programmes promote male-dominated crops, frequently at the expense of women’s vegetable plots. \nThus, the design of development policy needs to integrate women into development \nprogrammes so long as the latter influences the welfare of women and children. This would entail increasing female participation rates in educational and training programmes, formal-sector employment, and agricultural extension programmes.\nIt is necessary to ensure that women have equal access to government resources provided \nthrough schooling, health and other services. In cases where the majority of female labour force is employed in the informal sector, formalising or legalising such employment would improve the economic status of women.\nThe consequences of a decline in women’s relative or absolute economic status have both \nethical and long-term economic implications. Any process of growth that fails to improve the welfare of the people experiencing the greatest hardship, has failed to accomplish one of the principal goals of development. Likewise, the low status of women, in the long run, is likely to translate into slower rates of economic growth. Thus, the benefits of current investments in human capital are more likely to be passed onto future generations if women are successfully integrated into the growth process. \nIn addition, considering that human capital is perhaps the most important prerequisite \nfor growth, education and enhanced economic status for women are critical to meeting long-term development objectives. Women-centred poverty strategies often require us to challenge basic assumptions. Understanding is necessary of the crucial role that women can play in a community’s escape from poverty. The involvement of women will be most effective if it forms the basis for action, when addressing poverty. In general, women must be drawn into the economic mainstream in order to improve living conditions for the poorest individuals (Todaro and Smith, 2015)."

It forms the basis for local level decision-making in agriculture and connects people directly with their environment (Warren and Rajasekaran, 1993). Thus, \nindigenous knowledge is locally based and developed within the communities and used to solve problems within society; it is also dynamic.\nVariously known as “traditional knowledge,” “local knowledge” and “traditional wisdom,” \nindigenous knowledge is used to solve different problems, including relief of poverty. More often than not the practices associated with indigenous knowledge serve as pooling resources for a common good.\nEthiopia is endowed with diverse cultures and peoples that are rich in indigenous \nknowledge and associated practices. Some of the indigenous knowledge and practices are unique to specific localities and others are common to the wider environment. The following sections explore some of the common practices in different parts of Ethiopia.\nIdir is the most common informal institution in Ethiopia. Although it is a form of burial \nsociety, it also provides other support and consolation to its members in times of death and \ngrief. It is an association established among neighbours or workers to raise funds that will be used during emergencies, such as death within these groups and their families. It is also known as a traditional burial association. Idir is characterized as a group life insurance. \nAs such it usually has a large membership and the weekly or monthly membership is minimal and affordable by all. Idir guarantees grieving families the complete assistance \n(financial or otherwise) they seek in times of emergency. Idir members are required to \nattend funerals and must always be ready to help the ceremony of burial. Idir can be \nestablished by a community or village, at the workplace, or among friends and family.\nIqub (also called “ Ikub”) is a rotating credit association which is established by a small \ngroup of people in order to provide substantial funding for members to improve their lives \nand living conditions. Serving as a savings club, each member contributes to the pool of money weekly or monthly.\nIqub enables a family, particularly a poor family, to obtain the necessary funding for \nactivities such as weddings, building a house, or starting a small business. The rotating fund is a means for poor people to make investments that they would normally never consider making due to lack of money. Iqub is more flexible and accessible than banks"

As a result, people without formal education are not \ndiscouraged from joining. Moreover, for a small payment each week or month, members of Iqub can keep a steady flow of money to help any member of the group on a rotational \nbasis.\nIqub and Idir can be characterized as traditional financial associations. While Idir is a \nlong-term association, Iqub can be temporary or permanent, depending on the needs of \nthe members. Yet the two are informal, bottom-up, and widely practiced socio-economic traditions in Ethiopia. They serve the needs of the society in a sustainable way and they are based on available human or material resources.\nThese informal associations guarantee that everyone is taken care of in times of need \nthrough participatory and enabling means. In times of death, the community is kept intact and the grieving family instantly gets financial and social support. Iqub and Idir \nare remarkable examples to show that poverty does not define a person or a society. Economically disadvantaged societies are able to use traditional practices and knowledge to sustain themselves. Their motto is: “Idir, Iqub, for mutual benefits, to lessen societal burden.”\nThese associations are based on participatory principles, and as a result they promote \naccountability, transparency, tolerance and dialogue. In addition, they tend to foster friendship among members. The strong ties established among Iqub members also tend to \ndiscourage defaults.\nOther informal associations include Debo or a work group where community members \n(who are also Debo members) assist an individual on a rotational basis, often for free. \nIt is often organised by men to pool their labour to work on each other’s farmland, on \nrotational basis.\nThere are numerous similar institutions across the country, each playing important roles \nin poverty reduction and as pathways to upward mobility. However, being informal associations, they do not figure out in the formal, documented arena of social and economic life.\nIn addition to the above forms of associations, rural and urban cottage industries play \nan important role in lifting people out of poverty.

Still others focus on wellbeing expressed as the \ncapability (or lack) of the individual to function in society. Poverty can be seen in relative and absolute terms.

Before that, the two \ndecades of donor-sponsored reform efforts to Africa failed to help most sub-Saharan economies to overcome the fiscal and balance of payment deficits. During the mid-1990s, several civil wars ended and a wave of democratization started. It has been documented that, as indicated by socio-economic indicators, Ethiopia appears to be one of the poorest countries in the world. To reverse this image, a number of economic reforms were taken by different governments.\nThis unit presents an overview of macroeconomic reforms in Ethiopia. We will also \nexamine the national development objectives and strategies under the Monarchy, Derg, and FDRE before and after a reform. Finally, we will study an overview of home-grown economic reforms and fiscal decentralization in Ethiopia.\nLearning Outcomes\nAt the end of this unit, you will be able to: \n\texplain economic reforms in Ethiopia.\n\tunderstand national development objectives and strategies\n\tunderstand home grown economic reforms.\n\trecognize the role of private sector in the reform process."

The ancient monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of a short-lived Italian occupation effort from 1936–1941. In 1974, a military junta, the “Derg”, deposed Emperor Haile Selassie I (who had ruled since 1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings, widespread drought, and massive emigration problems, the regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). A constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia’s first multiparty election was held in 1995."

The \ngovernment focused its development efforts on expansion of the bureaucratic structure and ancillary services. By the early 1950s, Emperor Haile Selassie I had renewed calls for a transition from a subsistence economy to an agro-industrial economy. A key element of the emperor’s new economic policy was the adoption of centrally administered development plans. Between 1945 and 1957, several technical missions, including one each from the United States, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and former Yugoslavia, prepared a series of development plans. However, these plans failed to achieve any meaningful results, largely because basic statistical data were scarce and the government’s administrative and technical capabilities were minimal. In 1954/55 the government created the National Economic Council which helped to prepare Ethiopia’s three five-year development plans.\nThe First Five-Year Plan (1957 – 1961)\nMain Objectives were:\n\tDevelopment of a strong infrastructure, particularly in transportation, construction, \nand communications, to link isolated regions.\n\tEstablishment of a cadre of skilled and semi-skilled personnel to work in processing \nindustries to help reduce Ethiopia’s dependence on imports.\n\t Acceleration of agricultural development by promoting commercial agricultural \nventures. During the plan period, the gross national product (GNP) increased at a 3.2% annual rate, as opposed to the projected figure of 3.7%, and growth in economic sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and mining failed to meet the national plan’s targets. On the other hand, exports increased at a 3.5% annual rate, whereas imports grew at a rate of 6.4% per annum, thus failing to correct the negative balance of trade that had existed since 1951.The First Five-Year Development Plan promoted improved production of cash crops, including coffee, which accounted for 70% of foreign exchange earnings."

Large-scale commercial farms for production of cotton, coffee and sugar were promoted as a source of income over small-scale subsistence farms, which accounted for about 80% of cereal production.\nThe second plan’s objectives were:\n\tto change Ethiopia’s predominantly agricultural economy to an agro-industry \nalone.\n\tdiversification of production, introduction of modern processing methods, and \nexpansion of the economy’s productive capacity to increase the country’s growth \nrate.\nThe Third Five- Year Plan (1968–1973)\nThe third Five-Year Development Plan shifted its focus to the development of the \nagricultural sector in order to address the rising problem of food shortages in Ethiopia. The Integrated Rural Development project was also established to address rural development challenges and expand the agricultural commercial market system. It predominantly focused on improving the distribution of agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and seeds used by commercial farmers, and expanding rural health services. Nonetheless, the monarchy continued to envision the development of the non-agricultural sector as the main driver of economic development.\nThe third plan’s objectives:\n\traising manufacturing and agro-industrial performance.\n\t expansion of educational opportunities.\t improvement in peasant agriculture.\nThe second five-year plan and the third five-year plans anticipated that the economy would \ngrow at an annual rate of 4.3% and 6.0%, respectively. But the Planning Commission never assessed the performance of these two plans, largely because of a shortage of qualified personnel.\nHowever, according to data from the Central Statistical Authority, from 1960/61 to 1973/74 \nthe economy achieved sustained economic growth.

By the early 1970s, Ethiopia’s economy not only had started to grow but also had begun to diversify into areas such as manufacturing and services. However, these changes failed to improve the lives of most Ethiopians.\nThis failure could be attributed to the feudal land tenure system that deprived millions of \nrural peasants of the right to appropriate land and other resources. A combination of public dissatisfaction, food shortages and the rise of a military government led to the overthrow of the monarchy in 1974.\n7.1.2 National Development Plan under the Socialist Period (1974-1991)\nThe 1974 revolution by the Derg resulted in the establishment of a socialist state which aimed at the nationalization and restructuring of the Ethiopian economy. The Derg changed the previous national development strategy, placing the emphasis on a centrally planned economy. Industry-led development was deployed as the main development strategy. Rural land and other productive assets were nationalized, and land was distributed among farmers. Commercial farms were put under government control, and land tenancy was abolished. Furthermore, private commercial labourers and commercial farming were marginalized, and large collectivization programmes were promoted through resettlement and villagisation programmes. The military government maintained an overvalued currency and implemented marketing and pricing policies. In addition, the government established the Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC) to set pricing systems, for agricultural goods and set quotas for grain production which were significantly lower than market prices. Economic planning and development in the post-revolution period had four distinct phases.\nI. 1974-1978: during this period, there was little economic growth. Instead, the government’s nationalization measures and the highly unstable political climate caused economic dislocation in sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing. Additionally, the military budget consumed a substantial portion of the nation’s resources. As a result of these problems, gross domestic product increased at only an average annual rate of 0.4%."

The government’s new Development through Cooperation Campaign (commonly referred to as “Zemecha”) also contributed to the economy’s improvement. Consequently, gross domestic product grew at an average annual rate of 5.7%. Benefiting from good weather, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 3.6%, and manufacturing increased at an average annual rate of 18.9%.\nIII. 1980-1985: various annual development campaign programmes were implemented during this period, but still the economy experienced a setback as gross domestic product declined, manufacturing took a downturn, and agriculture reached a crisis stage. This happened due to four reasons:\n\twidespread drought all over the country,\n\tmanufacturing sector stagnated as agricultural inputs declined,\t lack of foreign exchange and declining investment\t high rise in defense expenditure.\nI V. 1985-1990: the government prepared a ten-year perspective plan for the period \n1984-1994, which aimed at the development of agriculture, enhancement of exports, and improvement in the quality of livestock. To achieve this, strategies of cooperativisation and establishment of state farms, etc., were adopted. As a result, the agricultural decline was reversed and the manufacturing sector also grew. Gross domestic product increased at an average annual rate of 5%. However, the lingering effects of the 1984/85 droughts undercut these achievements and contributed to the economy’s overall stagnation during this period.\n7.1.3 National Development Plan under FDRE\nThe Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front’s (EPRDF’s) rise to power in 1991 resulted in a considerable shift in national development strategies. The EPRDF moved Ethiopia’s development vision away from the previous centrally planned industrial development and towards a new agricultural-led development approach. Many of the previous governments’ policies were reversed, agricultural price controls were removed, and state farm assets were privatized. In addition, the new government adopted an export-oriented development strategy and implemented structural adjustment programmes (SAPs).

The programme entailed three main strategies: expansion of agricultural technologies; investment in agricultural infrastructure, including inputs; and boosting rural non-agricultural sectors. The programme aimed at boosting agricultural productivity by improving the use of fertilizers and seeds, with the ultimate aim of boosting agricultural production to serve as input and drive industrial development.\nThe ADLI also encompassed wider socio-economic development programmes, including \ninvestment in infrastructure such as roads, telecommunication and electricity grids. Furthermore, the plan aimed at enhancing the flow of finance, local governments’ administrative capacity, and the development of agro-processing industries. A series of investment plans were made under the ADLI, including rural technical and vocational education and training services (TVETs), the development of water resources (hydro power and irrigation), improvements in microfinance institutions, improvements in the marketing of agricultural products, and the restructuring of smallholder co-operatives.\nThe government heavily invested in extension programmes and introduced the \nParticipatory Demonstration and Training Extension System (PADETES). PADETES was used to distribute fertilizers, seed and credit, as well as to spread information on better agricultural practices, to smallholder farmers. The ADLI remains the key pillar and guiding framework for other successive development plans, including the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction (SDPRP), Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP), Growth and Transformation Plan I(GTPI).and Growth and Transformation Plan II(GTP II)\nThe Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) government initiated the \nFive-Year Development Program known as Peace, Democracy and Development Program which emphasized the interrelationships between peace, democracy and development. The major goals and objectives of the programme were as follows:\n\tPoverty alleviation through rapid economic growth.\n\t Ensuring peace and security by strengthening a political system that promotes \npeople’s equality and fraternity, guaranteeing administrative justice and peaceful \ncoexistence with neighbouring countries."

The PASDEP was Ethiopia’s second poverty reduction strategy, covering the periods between 2005/06 and 2009/10.

Building all-inclusive implementation capacity.2. A massive push to accelerate economic growth.3. Creating the balance between economic development and population growth.4. Unleashing the potentials of Ethiopia’s women.5. Strengthening the infrastructural backbone of the country.6. Strengthening human resource development.7. Managing risk and volatility8. Creating employment opportunities.\nBased on these strategic pillars, two alternative economic growth scenarios were \nconsidered. In the base case scenario, it was considered that to achieve the MDGs, an average economic growth rate of 7% per annum was necessary. For the high case scenario, which aimed beyond achievement of MDGs targets, a 10% annual average economic growth target was set so as to lay the foundation for the realization of the development vision of the country.\nc.Growth and Transformation Plan I (GTP I) (2010/11-2014/15)\nGTPI was the third national development plan covering the period between 20 10/11 and 20 14/15.

In addition, GTP I promoted the production of high-value crops and set sector-based targets\nGTP I built on the PASDEP and widened its remit to include industrialization as a way \nof creating structural transformation. The plan recognized the importance of urban areas and industrial development for structural transformation and for creating employment for Ethiopia’s growing population. It promoted investment in labour-intensive micro and small-scale enterprises (MSEs), as they provide significant opportunities for processing of agricultural goods. The plan envisioned labour-intensive manufacturing MSEs as a strategy for creating linkages with the rest of the economy (including the agricultural sector), as well as a strategy for an import substitution and export-oriented industrialization programme.\nThe first Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) was articulated through the following \nfour overarching objectives: \ni.

The major challenges are identified below:\nFailure to ensure quality economic growth:  although high economic was registered, there \nwere gaps in terms of creating adequate job opportunities, ensuring equitable distributions, \nensuring structural transformations, and creating sectoral linkages and synergies.\nExternal debt distress: besides the lack of or limited competitiveness in international \nmarkets, our domestic products were also not able to compete with imported commodities. The bulk of Ethiopia’s export commodities come from a limited number of agricultural products without significant value additions. Moreover, domestic productions were unable to fulfil the demand for input for domestic economic activities and industrialization. As a result, the economy largely depended on import, and the demand for imported commodities increased from year to year and the gap between export and import trade widened.\nImbalance between domestic savings and investment:  Ethiopia experienced a high rate \nof growth in investment between 2010 and 2020.However, domestic savings were unable \nto satisfy the domestic investment demand, causing large investment-savings imbalance.\nTo realize the objective of boosting domestic saving, a host of reform measures were \nundertaken during the GTP-I and GTPII period in Ethiopia. The measures include: awareness creation and community mobilization activities, expanding financial institutions (banks) and services, raising the minimum deposit rate, strengthening existing and introducing new"

Accordingly, the share of gross domestic saving in GDP increased from 9.5% in 2009/10 to 24.3% in 2017/18 from 22.4% in 2014/15 end of GTP-I period and slightly lower than the 24.6% GTP II target for the fiscal year. In parallel with the increase in domestic savings, the rate of gross national savings in GDP ratio also increased from 24.7 in 2009/10 to 32.2% in 2017/18. The difference between the two rates was mostly covered by net current transfer from the rest of the world.\nAt the same time, the share of gross domestic investment in GDP increased from 22.3% \nin 2009/10 to 34.1% by 2017/18. This domestic investment ratio is believed to have made a significant contribution to the rapid economic growth registered during the planning period. This very high investment rate is the result of both private and public investment spending. \nChallenges to stabilize inflation: although there are numerous factors that can cause inflation, high and persistent inflation is evidently highly associated with macroeconomic instability. The persistently high inflation rate registered over the past years, which exposed citizens to high cost of living, put the sustainability of the economic growth into question by affecting the sustainability of investment."

However, since 2003/04 Ethiopia has experienced the highest inflation and higher inflation rate of 55.2% was recorded during 2008.The major causes were the then high fuel and food prices shocks, weaker foreign exchange earnings, and rising demand for imports that depleted foreign currency reserves of the country.

Prosperity is largely defined in terms of happiness, improvement in standard of living and quality of life, and the level of complete satisfaction created by the overall capability we build through economic gain, human and social development by harnessing tangible and intangible wealth, including social capital and natural resource wealth. Hence, prosperity should be defined in terms of the overall human and institutional capability created over the long-term whose development outcomes can be expressed as follows:\n1.Improvement in income levels and wealth accumulations so that every citizen will be \nable to satisfy their basic needs and aspirations.\n2.Basic economic and social services such as food, clean water, shelter, health, education, and other basic services should be accessible to every citizen regardless of their economic status.\n3. Creating an enabling and just environment where citizens will be able to utilize their \npotentials and resources so that they can lead a decent quality life.\n4.Improvement in social dignity, equality, and freedom where citizens can freely participate in every social, economic, and political affairs of their country regardless of their social background.\nObjectives of the Development Plan\nTo achieve the national long-term plan of making Ethiopia an African beacon of prosperity, \nthe following major development objectives are:\n1.Building a prosperous country by creating a pragmatic market-based economic system and enhancing the role and participation of the private sectors."

The manner in which \nthese public investments were realized and the rapid growth achieved over the years has also caused continuous inflationary pressures. In addition, despite its rapid growth, the economy failed to raise productivity and create adequate job opportunities. Due to the heavy debt burden, it has become challenging to sustain the rapid pace of the growth, calling for a new growth financing approach doing away from the heavy reliance on public spending and debt financing.\nThe home-grown economic reform (HGER) with the central objectives of sustaining rapid \ngrowth, maintaining stable macroeconomic environment by reducing debt vulnerabilities and creating adequate and sustainable job opportunities has, therefore, been domestically initiated. The economic reforms are being translated into action through policy that enhances the supply side of the economy. The main aim and focus of the HGER is the enhancement of productivity and competitiveness of the overall economy, and a gradual transition from public to private sector-led growth. As a result, a stable macro economy will be ensured and the economy should be able to generate adequate jobs to arrest the rampant unemployment and the inflationary pressures. The HGER plan is classified into macroeconomic reforms, sectoral reforms, and structural reforms.\n7.2.1 Macroeconomic Reforms\nIn order to eliminate macroeconomic imbalances and create a stable macro economy, strict macroeconomic management has been put in place.. With regard to the overall macroeconomic management, strict monitoring has been put at work, and the following key focus areas have been identified in the macroeconomic reform plan.\n\tEnsuring fast, sustainable and broad-based economic growth. Reform efforts have been \nunderway across various sectors of the economy to ensure high economic growth that \nhas been slowed over t recent years. The efforts are being implemented in the way that involves several actors in the economy including the private sector and development partners. Evaluation of past development plans has been thoroughly done in order to learn from past strengths and rectify the weaknesses through the experiences gained from the challenges so as to design and implement inclusive development plans in the future. Economic growth performance that has been registered over the past years has been assessed in detail and it has been used as an input for subsequent reform measures."

As Ethiopia is at the early stage of \nmining subsector development, the role of the government in terms of infrastructure development and other targeted support in the subsector is vital for boosting private sectors’ confidence and trust.\n3.Tourism: although Ethiopia is endowed with abundant tourism destinations, the subsector has not fully utilized the available opportunity. As the subsector has a characterized with high potential for domestic and foreign revenue generation, and job creating opportunities, the tourism reform has paid particular attention to improving and expanding tourism destinations and related infrastructure, as well as improving the role and participation of the private sector.\nStructural Reforms\n Although the role of government in the economy shall continue, adjustments and reforms \nwill be made based on strategic policy performances and prevailing conditions.

In order to ensure an efficient government intervention, thorough studies would be conducted to see if there are failures that call for government interventions, and also to evaluate the feasibility of any government interventions in order to make sure that the necessary capacity and resource is available to implement the identified public project.

However one federal system differs from another. One country is more centralized than others (i.e. more of its decisions making power are in hands of authorities with a large jurisdiction). The extent of centralization can be measured by centralization ration which is direct government expenditure by central government divided total government expenditure. Direct government expenditure excludes federal grant/transfers. \nIn Ethiopia, the federal government makes fiscal equalization payments to local \ngovernments with the stated goal of equalizing the fiscal capacity of local governments to provide services. It helps regional governments to provide similar sets of public services to their citizens with similar tax incidence. Fiscal equalization aims at reducing or eliminating differences in net fiscal benefits which is the difference between the utility that households derive from consuming public services and the taxes they pay for producing these services. It is a companion of fiscal decentralization which ensures economic governance such as equity, efficiency and stability of fiscal policy.\nIn the past ten years 2010 to 2020, additional budgetary support has been provided \nfor regional governments to finance capital projects that help achieve the targets of the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).For instance, in 2017/18, Birr 7 billion has be allocated to regional states as per the grant formula for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This also to enhance fiscal equalization and narrow regional disparities in basic social services such as education, health, water and sanitation.\n7.3.1 Disadvantages and Advantages of Decentralized System\nMost economists agree that spending and taxing decision intended to stabilises (price stability and reduce unemployment) should be made by central government. Local/ state government too small to affect overall economic activity., national governments themselves are finding difficult to influence the economy in this era of globalization requiring action for world government. With respect to the microeconomic activities of efficiency and equity there is disagreement among economists. There are both opponents and proponents.\nDisadvantages of Decentralized SystemInterstate/local externalities : there are costs and benefits of local government goods and \nservices to residents who live in other political jurisdictions.

For example, the more people who \nuse public library, the lower the cost per user. If each community constructs its own library (decentralization). costs per user are higher than necessary. Thus consolidation is one way to for communities to take advantage of scale economies. Of course, various activities have different scale economies and optimal scale. \nInefficient tax system: efficient tax requires higher a tax rate on inelastic demanded or \nsupplied goods and vice versa. Goods which are inelastic at national level may be elastic at local level. Some goods like capital though inelastic at national level are elastic at local level. But local government usually imposes little tax on capital to promote investment which inefficient from national point of view.\nLoss of scale of economies in tax collection: individual communities may not be able \ntake advantage of scale economies in the collection of taxes. Each community has to devote resources (labour, equipment, etc.) to tax administration, made may be made by having a joint taxing authority. \nIneffectiveness of redistributing program: (equity measures)\nSuppose the tax and expenditure pattern in a particular community is favourable to the \npoor.

They include tailoring output to local \ntaste/local specific, fostering intergovernmental competition, and experimentation and innovation in locally provided public goods and services.\nTailoring output to local tastes/local specific: peoples in different regions and communities \nhave different tastes and preferences. A centralized government tends to provide the same level of public services throughout the country regardless of the fact that peoples tastes differ.

Examples include climate change, the growth of mega-cities, land degradation and the profound consequences of increasing global population which is consuming ever more natural resources ( Foresight, 2011).\nEconomics is the study of the allocation of limited resources to satisfy human wants. The word “resource” is used synonymously with the factors of production (inputs). The commonly identified classes of production inputs include land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship. Sometimes, energy is also specified as a separate production factor."

The scarcity of resources implies that their use is costly and results in an opportunity cost.\nWe can identify natural and environmental resources as a subset of a more general \ncategory of economic resources. Resources provide a broader set of goods and services. Most environmental resources have become increasingly scarce, as the scale of economic activity expands. There is recognition that economic activities degrade and deplete the natural environment. In other words, the stability and resilience of the ecosystem can be threatened by excessive expansion of economic activities. Environmental resources are ultimately finite. Concern for exhaustion of future environmental resources is increasing and the need for conservation is growing.Environmental resources can be classified into different categories. The prominent classification is between renewable and non-renewable resources. Biologically \nrenewable resources include forests, fish, animal population, and biomass stock. We also have renewable physical stock which is capable of regeneration such as soil structure and fertility, the ozone layer, the earth’s waste processing capacity. But both biological and physical renewable resources are potentially exhaustible. Hence, optimal and efficient growth and a sustainable development path has to be pursued. Some resources yield monetized flows such as forests, exploited oil, and minerals. Other resources yield non-monetized benefits such as fresh air, rivers, lakes, and oceans.\nThe concept of ecosystem is a complex set of interdependencies between the biological \nand physical systems and is continually in a dynamic process of development and change. The resilience of an ecosystem is a measure of the extent to which it can be subjected to disturbances without the system’s parameters being changed. The threshold levels of some system variables can be reduced due to economic behaviour. These insights from ecology have important implications for human behaviour and in particular for the rates of depletion and harvesting of non-renewable and exhaustible resources.\nEnvironmental resources around the world face rising pressures with severe consequences \nfor future growth potential and the quality of life. Generally, the global ecosystem is a flow of raw materials and energy from the planetary sources, which then go through the economy, to the planetary sinks, receiving the wastes of the economic system. Underlying the pressure on the sources and sinks is the growth of the world population and industrial production (Swanson , 2012)."

It dates back to the 1950s with the growing concern over the great smog of London in 1952, the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962 and the “Limits to Growth” report of 1972. The concern is borne of the fact that perpetual economic growth entails severe consequences for the environment. For example, resources may be used up quickly, while more and more by-products of production are dumped into the environment, which leads to severe environmental degradation.\nIs it then possible to achieve growth without further damage to the environment? At one \npoint, it was widely believed that as per capita incomes rose, pollution and other forms of environmental degradation would first rise and then fall in an inverted-U pattern. Thus, as incomes rise, societies will have both the means and the willingness to pay for environmental protection. This idea is referred to as the “environmental Kuznets curve”.The notion is related Kuznets’s hypothesis which states that inequality would first rise and then fall as incomes increased ( Todaro and Smith, 2015).\nIn spite of these theoretical arguments, the growing concern and commitment by the international community over environment and development persisted for decades. Examples include the publication of the Brundtland Commission Report “Our Common Future” in 1987, the UN Conference on Environment and Development (also known as the Rio Earth Summit) convened in 1992, the Kyoto Protocol signed in 1997, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) formed in 1998 followed by the Millennium Development Goals launched in 2000, the Rio+20 Earth Summit in 2012, and the Sustainable Development Goals agreed in 2015.\nNowadays, economists increasingly focused on the implications of environmental issues \nfor the success of development efforts. It has become obvious that classic market failures"

It has become equally apparent that the interaction \nbetween poverty and environmental degradation can lead to a self-perpetuating process. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘poverty environment nexus” whereby the poor are both agents and victims of environmental degradation. At the same time, the environment disproportionately affects the poor and poverty perpetuates environmental degradation. This happens, for example, when communities unintentionally destroy or exhaust the resources on which they rely for survival due to ignorance or economic necessity. The attendant environmental degradation diminishes the pace of economic development by imposing high costs on developing countries through reduced productivity of resources and health-related expenses. Undoubtedly, the damage to soil, water supplies, and forests resulting from unsustainable methods of production can greatly reduce long-term national productivity but paradoxically can show up as having a positive impact on current gross national product figures.\nFor as long as the solutions to environmental problems involve enhancing the productivity \nof resources and improving living conditions, achieving environmentally sustainable growth is synonymous with economic development. Hence, environmental considerations should form an integral part of development policy initiatives. It is also important that the long-term implications of environmental quality should be considered in economic analysis. \nIn the next sections, we will briefly focus on basic issues that define the economy and the \nenvironment involving linkages between the environment and rural development, urban development, population and resources.\n8.1.1 Rural Development and Environment\nRural development refers to the process of improving the quality of life and economic wellbeing of people who live in rural areas. When we say improvement, it includes people’s livelihoods (e.g., provision of electricity, clean water, access roads, and education). Rural development has traditionally centred on exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. However, it has to be noted that changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. \nRural development as a development strategy is an intervention that focuses on the use \nof natural resources to address the challenges of the rural areas. The interventions include increasing agricultural production and supporting sectors such as education, health, water"

In this case, rural development \nis linked with agricultural development. \nSome of the major issues that agriculture and agricultural development face in relation to \nenvironment include the use of pesticides, loss of agricultural land fertility, encroachment by increased and rapid urbanization, forest depletion, declining soil fertility, loss of topsoil, desertification and unsustainable rates of water usage, and air pollution (Perman et al , \n2003).\nThe effect of population on the environment is thus, expressed in terms of population \npressure and increased demand for food. First, this results in the intensification of \nsoil erosion, natural depletion, destruction of soil structure (water holding capacity), and inorganic nutrients’ application unbalances the soil structure. Second, there is the possibility of pollution from inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides, increased resistance of pests, biodiversity loss, reduction of resilience, sometimes irreversible salination, water logging and environmental degradation. There is also extensification (land expansion) \nwhich causes deforestation and desertification. Both intensification and extensification are associated with environmental problems.\nIn developing countries including Ethiopia, most people live in rural areas and agriculture \nis their main occupation. The prevalence of poverty means that rural poverty and environmental degradation interact. The following example shows how this happens.\nLow income households cut trees for firewood and cultivate marginal land during the \nprocess of intensification of land use. The logging of trees and cutting of forests for cultivation leads to deforestation. These and overgrazing means the soil is exposed to flooding and erosion which in turn acts as factors in the cycle of rural poverty and environmental destruction.\n8.1.2 Urban Development and Environment\nUrban development is the social, cultural, economic and physical development of cities and the underlying causes of these processes. It covers infrastructure for education, health, justice, solid waste, markets, and street pavements. It also pays special attention to slums in large cities and informal settlements in towns and peri-urban areas.\nThe World Bank estimates that over 50% of the population lives in urban areas globally. \nBy 2045, the world’s urban population will increase by 1.5 times to 6 billion. Hence, city leaders need to move quickly to plan for growth and provide the basic services,"

The early stages of urbanization and industrialization in developing countries are generally accompanied by rising incomes and worsening environmental conditions. Urban pollution tends first to rise with national income levels and then to fall.\nUrbanisation in developing countries creates such problems as housing, power, water, \ntransport etc. (Jhingan, 2012). Many governments are ill prepared to cope with increased \nstrain on existing urban water supplies and sanitation facilities.\nCongestion, vehicular and industrial emissions, and poorly ventilated household stoves \nalso inflate the high environmental costs of urban crowding. The inaccessibility of clean water and the lack of sanitation are some of the environmental factors which affect the health of the urban poor.\nMoreover, the rising levels of industrial emissions or pollution directly affect the health of \nurban inhabitants. The urban poor, in particular, are likely to suffer serious consequences resulting from environmental degradation. Besides, the growth of urban slums and attendant malnutrition and poor health among a large proportion of urban dwellers in shantytowns tend to reduce individual resistance to environmental hazards.\nOne solution to these problems is to deploy clean technologies that by design produce less \npollution and waste and use resources more efficiently. \n8.1.3 Population, Resources and the Environment\nThe world’s population reached about 7.7 billion in 2019. According to the United Nations Population Division, this figure is projected to rise to about 8.1 billion in 2025 and about 9.6 billion by the year 2050. The overwhelming majority or more than three-quarters of the world’s population will live in the developing world ( Todaro and Smith, 2015).\nIn order to meet the expanded food needs of rapidly growing populations, it is estimated that food production will have to increase by at least 50% in the next three decades. Because land in many areas of the developing world is being unsustainably overexploited by existing populations, meeting this output target will require radical changes in the distribution, use, and quantity of resources that are available to the agricultural sector."

This is particularly the case where the majority of the people are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. With a rapidly rising population, agricultural land holdings become smaller and unviable to cultivate. There is no possibility of increasing farm production through the use of new land (extensive cultivation). Consequently, many households continue to live in poverty. \nEven in countries with rich natural resources such as Brazil and other Latin American \ncountries, rapidly increasing population makes it difficult to invest in roads, public services, drainage and other agricultural infrastructure needed to tap such resources ( Jhingan, \n2012).\nGiven limited resources, the consequences are felt by society, economy and the environment. \nThe following example shows some of the linkages between the above factors. \nIncreasing population density contributes to severe and accelerating degradation of the \nvery resources that the populations depend on for survival in the following manner. Rapid population growth disturbs the land-man ratio. For example, pressure of population on land increases due to inelastic supply of land. It adds to disguised unemployment and reduces per capita productivity further. As the number of landless workers increases, their wages fall. As a result, low per capita productivity reduces the propensity to save and invest. Because of this, the use of improved techniques and other improvements on land are not possible. Moreover, capital formation in agriculture suffers and the economy is bogged down to the subsistence level. The problem of feeding additional population becomes serious due to acute shortage of food products. These have to be imported which increases the balance of payment difficulties. Thus, the growth of population retards agricultural development and creates a number of other problems discussed above.\nMoreover, the pressure of rapid growth forces people to obtain more food for themselves and \ntheir livestock. Hence, they over-cultivate the semi-arid areas. This leads to desertification over the long run when land stops yielding anything. Besides, rapid population growth leads to the migration of large numbers of people to urban areas with industrialization resulting in severe air, water and noise pollution in cities and towns ( Jhingan, 2012).\nIt has to be noted, nonetheless, that much of the concern over environmental issues stems from the perception that we may reach a limit to the number of people whose needs can be met by the earth’s finite resources. We may or may not reach this point given the potential"

However, the rate and timing of fertility declines, and thus, the eventual size of world population, will largely depend on the commitment of governments to creating economic and institutional conditions that are conducive to limiting fertility.\nWhat does it take for environmental policies to succeed in countries like Ethiopia? First, \nsuch countries must address the issues of poverty, landlessness, and lack of access to institutional resources.

It is often used \nin reference to the trend that began in the mid-twentieth century and attributed largely to human activities (industrial, forestry, and agricultural) emitting greenhouse gases (GhG). The primary greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere are water vapour (H\n2O), carbon \ndioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ozone (O3). Due to increasing \neconomic activities, global GhG emissions of these gasses have grown since pre-industrial times, with an increase of 70% between 1970 and 2004 (IPCC, 2007). Three GhGs, in particular, had increased in the atmosphere. They are CO\n2, CH4, and N2O.\nGreenhouse gases of the atmosphere are both natural and anthropogenic which absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of thermal infrared radiation"

This property causes \nwhat is known as the greenhouse effect.\nIt so happens that the GhGs trap long-wave radiation in the upper atmosphere, raise \natmospheric temperatures and produce other changes in the climate system. Before the Industrial Revolution, from around 1750 to 2011, for example, CO\n2 increased by 40% \nwhile N2O increased by 150% and nitrous oxide by 20% (IPCC, 2013). The increase is due \nto burning of fossil fuels and reductions in some of the “sinks” for carbon dioxide, notably forests. There is an economic activity-energy-emission link through the greenhouse effect. In other words, the process of global warming relates economic activity to an associated level and pattern of energy and material flows corresponding to which are flows of GhG emissions. Carbon emissions are caused by fossil fuel use while agricultural activities and the decomposition and disposal of waste are important emitters of methane. In all, rising GhGs are the main drivers of climate change.\n8.2.2 Climate Change\nClimate change denotes a variation in the mean state of the climate persisting for an extended period (typically decades or longer) and resulting from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2007, 2013). In other words, climate change refers to significant \nand persistent change in the mean state of the climate system that alters the composition of the global atmosphere which is observed over long periods of time. It includes such changes as average temperatures, precipitation, humidity, wind conditions, and all other aspects of the earth’s climate. \nThere is a difference between climate and weather. Climate is the average weather pattern \nover many years expressed through variables such as temperature, precipitation and \nwind. On the other hand, the term weather represents short-term atmospheric conditions \nexpressed in the mix of events such as temperature, rainfall and humidity that occur each day or week. \nClimate change is one of the most urgent and complex challenges for societies and \neconomies. For developing countries like Ethiopia, climate change complicates the existing challenges of poverty eradication. Indeed, for many parts of the world, climate change is an everyday reality with implications for people’s livelihoods, infrastructure and institutions, as well as beliefs, cultures and identities."

By 2016, the mean temperatures had already reached 1°C above the pre-industrial level.\nClimate change is caused by or attributed to the emissions of greenhouse gases triggering \nglobal warming. Of the greenhouse gases, CO\n2 is the largest in causing global warming \nand hence, climate change. It contributes 77% to the greenhouse effect. Methane (CH4) \nfollows with about 14%, and nitrous oxide (N2O) with 8% (IPCC, 2007).\nAccording to the American Environmental Protection Agency, the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States is from burning fossil fuels (oil, coal, natural gas) for electricity, heat, and transportation.\nIn developing countries, deforestation is said to contribute over 20% of harmful greenhouse \ngases, in addition to the losses it causes of valuable biodiversity and the environmental services of cleaning air and water. \n8.2.4 Indicators of Climate Change\nAccording to the IPCC, the warming of the climate system is unequivocal. The evidence comes from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level ( Tietenberg and\nLewis, 2012).\nThere are several indicators of climate change. They include unpredictable rain patterns, \ntoo much and too little rain, higher average air and ocean temperatures, floods, sea level rise and the melting of glaciers and ice caps. Cold days, cold nights, and frosts have become less frequent while heat waves are more common. Moreover, the emergence of diseases such as malaria (in formerly cold climates due to the spread of mosquitoes) and respiratory diseases are common.\nGlobally, precipitation has increased in Australia, Central Asia, the Mediterranean Basin, \nthe Sahel, the Western United States. Heavy rainfall and floods have become more common; so are storms and tropical cyclones. Many other regions have seen more frequent and more intense droughts."

It is often the \nshifting frequencies and magnitudes of storms, floods, droughts and other extremes that bring home the significance of climate change for vulnerable populations (IPCC 2014; Todaro and Smith, 2015). \nIn semi-arid and arid areas, the area that is suitable for agriculture, the length of growing \nseasons and yield potential are expected to decrease. This will further adversely affect food security and exacerbate malnutrition. Coastal fisheries, mangroves, and coral reefs will be degraded and threatened by rises in sea level and storms. \nThe worst impact will likely be felt by the very poor, who depend mostly on natural \nresources, including rain-fed agriculture. Moreover, the housing of the poor in urban as well as in rural areas is often poorly constructed and located in the most environmentally stressed areas. Due to this and other factors, they are vulnerable to heat waves, flooding, mud-slides, and diseases. \nImpacts of climate change also have health dimension. The World Health Organization \n(WHO) estimated that by 2004, over 140,000 excess deaths per year were due to diarrhoea, malaria, and malnutrition. The deaths were caused by the global warming that had taken place since the 1970s. Mosquito-carried malaria is expected to migrate further to higher altitudes, newly threatening Nairobi, Harare, and other cities. \nIn sum, one or more of the following impacts are expected to affect most of the \nworld’s poorest countries during this century. They are prolonged droughts, expanded desertification, increased severity of storms with heavy precipitation and flooding and consequent erosion, longer and more severe heat waves, reduced summer river flow and water shortages, decreased grain yields, climate-induced spread of pests and diseases, lost"

Other \nlikely ecological damage includes the loss of essential species such as pollinators and soil organisms, and forest fires.\n8.2.6 Vulnerability to Climate Change\nVulnerability to climate change refers to the degree to which a system is likely to experience harm as the result of exposure to climatic hazard. It depends on the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.\nVulnerability to climate change is multi-dimensional and it is a function of biophysical \noutcomes that is related to changes in temperature, precipitation, topography and soil, socio-political factors and a country’s level of economic development.\nThose who are most exposed and vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change are \nthe poor and marginalised people who live particularly in low-income areas. For example, the houses of the poor are constructed of mud, bamboo, straw, and other inexpensive or gatherable materials; and they are the most vulnerable to extreme weather events. These problems are compounded by the fact that the poor are underrepresented at all levels of decision-making regarding climate issues, which adds to their vulnerability to climatic risks.\nIn terms of regions, Africa and South Asia are identified as two of the most vulnerable \nregions to both current variations in climate and future climate change. The IPCC identified four zones which are highly vulnerable to climate change: sub-Saharan Africa faces drying, Asia faces flooding, and small islands face multiple sensitivities, while the Arctic face melting glaciers. \nSmall islands remain highly vulnerable to global warming; their size and location make \nthem the potential victims of rising sea level. Likewise, the coastal towns and settlements. Bangladesh, for example, is highly prone to flooding while the Horn of Africa for droughts. Towns like Dire Dawa in Eastern Ethiopia are prone to flooding. The Ethiopian Meteorological Agency provides information and alerts through radio and other media to populations in Ethiopia.\nIn terms of poverty and wellbeing, poor communities in high-risk areas are especially \nvulnerable to the impacts of climate change as they tend to have more limited adaptive capacities and are more dependent on climate-sensitive resources such as local water and"

Their low incomes make it difficult to finance adaptation. The international community has an obligation to support them in adapting to climate change. Without such support there is a serious risk that development progress will be undermined ( Stern, 2007).\n8.2.7 Means to Address Climate Change Challenges\nThere are two main ways to address the climate change crisis. The first is mitigation, and the second is adaptation. Mitigation deals with the causes of climate change whereas adaptation deals with the consequences.\nMitigation of Climate Change\nMitigation efforts are linked to reducing GhGs, especially CO\n2 or stabilization of GhGs \nconcentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic \ninterference with the climate system. \nMitigation policy responses are anticipatory policies that would estimate expected costs \nand benefits of pollution emissions abatement, identify socially optimal abatement targets and select policy instruments which minimize the expected costs of attaining the target. This is a preventive policy approach in some sense by its attempt to reduce costs (Permanet al, 2003).\nMany strategies have been proposed for the mitigation of emissions, including development of carbon markets, taxes on carbon, and subsidies to encourage faster technological progress. As a policy strategy, mitigation involves long-term limits on the amount of greenhouse emissions. In the short term, policies could be designed to limit the economic burden if abatement costs turned out initially to be unexpectedly high.\nSome of the mitigation measures are linked to forests. The Reducing Emissions from \nDeforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) mechanism, along with enhanced incentives for re-establishing and maintaining forests with engagement of indigenous communities that depend on them (known as REDD-plus), are examples. Another mitigatory mechanism is called Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which emerged from the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 (Todaro and Smith, 2015)."

This has many causes, but the rapid industrial growth in Asia is already a major contributor, and is expected to worsen substantially with the planned expansion of coal-fired electrical generation in China, India, and elsewhere. Policies and mechanisms have been introduced essentially to pay for costs of avoiding emissions in developing countries. \nHistorically, most of the greenhouse gases have been emitted in developed countries. \nTherefore, they have historic responsibility to deal with the problem. For example, they should take immediate steps to reduce emissions. They should also develop new technologies that will enable further reductions as well as successful adaptation to climate change. \nAt the same time, developing countries share current and future responsibilities. With \nhigh fertility rates, rising average incomes, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions, developing countries should take mitigation measures. China is now the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, although lower on a per capita basis than most rich countries. It will have to reduce emissions, and without such action, reductions in the developed world will only delay the possibly catastrophic consequences ( Todaro and Smith, 2015). \nThe poorer the country, the more difficult it is to absorb the costs of mitigation. Hence, low-income countries need for technical and financial assistance. For this reason, assisting developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has emerged as an important dimension for foreign aid. Achieving an international agreement on emissions targets, burden sharing, trading mechanisms and technological and financial assistance remains a high priority concern for the mitigation of climate change ( Kyoto 1995, Paris 2015, \nKigali 2016).\nSynergy between the environment and the conditions of the poor should be taken into \naccount when mitigating climate change. This could be done through the use of labour-intensive production mechanisms, access to credit and extension service, provision of necessities and employment, soil and water conservation, defining property rights and land tenure, forest land, grazing land as well as through improvement in health and education and a prudent environmental policy. Yet all these involve a more expensive development path for the poor countries, indicating to the need to share the cost equitably."

In other words, adaptation is the process of enabling human and natural systems to adjust to the actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects. \nThe UNDP defines adaptation to climate change as a process by which strategies to \nmoderate, cope with and take advantage of the consequences of climatic events are enhanced, developed and implemented. As a policy response, adaptation is a reactive policy that attempts to minimize the adverse impact of climate change ex post ( Perman\net al, 2003).\nA related term, “adaptive capacity”, refers to the ability of a system to adjust to climate change to moderate potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences.\nWhy is adaptation to climate change necessary? While action on mitigation is necessary, a \nsignificant amount of climate change is already happening and essentially inevitable. That means lags in the climate system means climate change will unfold for many years. Thus, adaptation to climate change is critical to protect livelihoods from climatic risks. It enables the systems to better cope with, manage or adjust to changing conditions.\nAdaptation is a universal condition of humanity. This is because adaptability of human \nsystems to changes is as old as human societies, and it is a vital characteristic that ensures the survival of cultures through time. However, adaptation to climate change presents newer, unique and complex challenges to societies.\nAdaptation takes place in two forms: “planned” (or policy) adaptation that is undertaken \nby governments and “autonomous” (or private) adaptation that is undertaken directly by households, farms, and firms in response to climate change. Local communities also take measures appropriate to their specific geography to address the problems of environmental degradation and climate change.\nThere are four classes of adaptation strategies: mobility, storage, diversification, and \ne communal pool. Mobility avoids risks across space; storage reduces risks which are experienced over time; diversification reduces risks across assets owned by households or collectives, and communal pool involves joint ownership of assets and resources; sharing"

It uses low carbon; it is resource efficient; and it is socially inclusive.\nGreen growth is defined as “fostering economic growth and development, while ensuring \nthat natural assets continue to provide the resources and environmental services on which our wellbeing relies” ( OECD, 2011). The OECD justifies green growth by citing growing \nrisks to development as growth continues to erode natural capital which means increased water scarcity, worsening resource bottlenecks, greater pollution, climate change, and unrecoverable biodiversity loss.\nIn a green economy, economic growth is supposed to be driven by public and private \ninvestments that reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance energy and resource"

The combination of \ninvestment and innovation will underpin sustained growth and give rise to new economic opportunities. \nThis occurs with the use of renewable energy that links low carbon to green growth. The \nmotive for using renewable energy emerges from the perceived scarcity of fuel fossils. Even without climate change, the potential for peak oil (i.e. rising demand and declining fossil fuel production) ,\n requires alternative modus operandi.\nThe sources of renewable energy are: solar, biomass and bio fuel, geothermal, hydroelectricity, tidal, and wind-driven. Given technological support, countries can use untapped renewable energy potential.

Studies indicate that agricultural landscapes in parts of Ethiopia have undergone unprecedented changes in an unsustainable direction as manifested in land degradation, biodiversity loss, and low agricultural productivity.\nTo address the problems of climate change, the Ethiopian government produced the National \nAdaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2007 and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) in 2011. These policy documents assessed key underlying causes of the country’s vulnerability to climate change as dependence on rain-fed agriculture, poor water resource development and a high population growth rate. Moreover, the government identified agriculture, health, transport, natural resources, energy and industry sectors as most vulnerable to climate change.\nIn 2011, the government initiated the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy. \nThe strategy envisioned carbon-neutral growth based on an energy-efficient development trajectory with a view to address both climate change adaptation (climate resilience) and mitigation (green economy) objectives (FDRE, 2011). The goal of the low carbon \nor carbon-neutral growth pathway is to achieve middle-income status by 2025, which initially raises GDP per capita level to $1000 USD. \nIn June 2020, the Ethiopian Government launched the Green Legacy Initiative, which is a \ntree-planting campaign aimed at curbing the effects of climate change and deforestation.
