Although the\nindustrial revolution was a great success in terms of technology, society, and the\nprovision of multiple services, it also introduced the production of huge quantities of\npollutants emitted into the air that are harmful to human health.

The health of susceptible and sensitive )\n\nindividuals can be impacted even on low air pollution days. Short-term exposure to\nair pollutants is closely related to COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),\ncough, shortness of breath, wheezing, asthma, respiratory disease, and high rates of\n\nhospitalization (a measurement of morbidity)\n\n(4) The long-term effects associated with air pollution are chronic asthma, pulmonary\ninsufficiency, cardiovascular diseases, and cardiovascular mortality. According to a\nSwedish cohort study, diabetes seems to be induced after long-term air pollution\nexposure. Moreover, air pollution seems to have various malign health effects in\nearly human life, such as respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and prenatal disorders,\n\nleading to infant mortality or chronic disease in adult age.\n\n(5) Air pollution mainly affects those living in large urban areas, where road emissions\ncontribute the most to the degradation of air quality. There is also a danger of industrial\naccidents, where the spread of a toxic fog can be fatal to the populations of the\nsurrounding areas. The dispersion of pollutants is determined by many parameters,\n\nmost notably atmospheric stability and wind.\n\n(6) In developing countries, the problem is more serious due to overpopulation and\nuncontrolled urbanization along with the development of industrialization. This\nleads to poor air quality, especially in countries with social disparity and a lack of\ninformation on sustainable management of the environment. The use of fuels such as\nwood fuel or solid fuel for domestic needs due to low incomes exposes people to bad-\nquality, polluted air at home. It is of note that three billion people around the world\nare using the above sources of energy for their daily heating and cooking needs. In\ndeveloping countries, the women of the household seem to carry the highest risk for\n\ndisease development due to their longer duration exposure to the indoor air pollution.\n\nS (Adapted from Frontiers in Public Health Journal, 2020) )\n\nRead the text again and say TRUE or FALSE to the following statements\nbased on the information in the text.\n\n1.

In many\nparts of the world, early civilizations formed when people began coming together\nin urban settlements. However, defining what civilization is, and what societies\nfall under that designation, is a hotly contested argument even among today’s\n\nanthropologists.\n\nThe word “civilization” relates to the Latin word “civitas” or “city.” This is\nwhy the most basic definition of the word “civilization” is “a society made up\nof cities.” But early in the development of the term, anthropologists and others\nused “civilization” and “civilized society” to differentiate between societies they\nfound culturally superior (which they were often part of), and those they found\nculturally inferior (which they referred to as “savage” or “barbaric” cultures). The\nterm “civilization” was often applied in an ethnocentric way, with “civilizations”\nbeing considered morally good and culturally advanced, and other societies being\nmorally wrong and “backward.” This complicated history is what makes defining\ncivilization troublesome for scholars, and why today’s modern definition is still in\n\nflux.\n\nStill, most anthropologists agree on some criteria to define a society as a civilization.\nFirst, civilizations have some kind of urban settlements and are not nomadic. With\nsupport from other people living in the settlement, labor is divided up into specific\njobs (called the division of labor) so not everyone has to focus on growing his/her\nown food. From this specialization comes class structure and government, both\naspects of a civilization. Another criterion for civilization is a surplus of food,\nwhich comes from having tools to aid in growing crops. Writing, trading, artwork\n\nand monuments, and development of science and technology are all aspects of\n\nS\n\ncivilizations.\n\n\\\n\\ English Student Textbook Grade 11"

However, when\nwe report things in the past, we usually change the tense by moving it one step\n\nback. Example:\n\nJ\n\nDirect speech: “J have a new car.’\n\nIndirect speech: He said he had a new car.\n\nChanging Time Expressions\n\nSometimes when you report a speech, it’s necessary to change the time expres-\n\nsions; particularly, when you are speaking about the past. Example:\n\nDirect speech: “I’m seeing my brother tomorrow.”\nIndirectspeech: She said she was seeing her brother the following day.\nReporting Questions\n\nWhen you report a question, you should change the interrogative form into an\naffirmative sentence, by changing the verb tense one step back, as in normal reported\n\nspeech. When we report a yes/no question, we use ‘if’. For example:\nDirectspeech: “Do they live here?”\nIndirectspeech: You asked me if they lived here.\n\nAs you can see, in the reported version of the question, ‘do’ is eliminated because\n\nit is no longer a question, and the verb ‘live’ becomes ‘lived’.\n\nFor questions starting with question words like ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘when’, ‘who’,\netc. Examples below:\n\nDirectspeech: “Where do they live?”\n\nIndirectspeech: You asked me where they lived.\nNote: We usually use the verb ‘ask’ to report a question.

Then, get into a small group of three and discuss on the word\nformation process and the grammatical class of the words you formed.\n\nNe\n\nTips on word formation\n\nAffixation is a process of adding or fixing inflections (prefixes, infixes and suffixes)\nto root words to form new words. For example, if the suffix -able is added to the\nword pass, the word passable is created. Likewise, 1f to the word passable the prefix\n\nin- is attached, another word is formed, impassable.\n\nAffixation is a very common and productive morphological process in English\nlanguage to form new words of the same or different grammatical class. In English,\nderivation is the form of affixation that yields new words. In the given example,\nthe word ‘impassable’ derived from the root word ‘pass’ through the process of\nadding the prefix 1m-‘ and the suffix ‘-able’. The suffix ‘-able’ changes the word\nclass of the root which is a ‘verb’ to adjective. And the prefix ‘im-‘ does not change\nthe word class, but changes the meaning of the word completely-from positive\nto negative. Both affixes are thus derivational. There are also inflectional affixes\nwhich only change the grammar of the root or base word (e.g. markers of number,\ntense, degree etc. in English). For example, the affixes such as ‘-er’ in ‘stronger’,\n‘-ed’ in ‘asked’ , and ‘—s’ in ‘books’ do not change the word class or meaning of\n\nthe base words, but they only change the simple degree to comparative, present to\n\npast and singular to plural, respectively.\n\n> yy,\n\n76 Ya\n( ) .

According to the report of Housing and Urban Development, there are\nover 500,000 people experiencing homelessness on any given night. It’s a difficult\nchallenge to tackle precisely because it is so multi-faceted, both in terms of its\ncauses and its far-reaching effects. Homelessness affects not only the people who\nmust struggle to survive on the street, but also the business owners or residents in\nthe neighborhoods. Petty crime and drug abuse are common. While many factors\nhave contributed to the rise in homeless rates, one of the most profound is the lack\n\nof adequate social support services.\n\nBy definition, a homeless person is someone without a permanent home. They may\nseek shelter in parking garages, and subway stations. On a purely practical level, if\na city can provide enough homeless shelters and other forms of affordable housing,\nthe people who would otherwise sleep on the streets can sleep far more safely with\n\na consistent roof over their heads.\n\nSocial support services, whether they are funded publicly or privately, would be\nable to tackle many of the immediate and long-term challenges that face people\nexperiencing homelessness. In addition to providing adequate and reliable shelter,\nservices like drug counseling, treatment for physical or emotional abuse, and career\n\ncounseling can address some of the factors that lead to homelessness.\n\nThe individual stories of each person going through homelessness will vary. What\nis often found, though, is that the homelessness came about because of a series of\nevents. A person may unexpectedly lose his job, which may lead to family problems\nat home, which may lead to drug abuse as a coping mechanism, which may lead to\nfurther financial stress, and so on. Appropriate social services at any point in this\n\nprocess may be able to prevent homelessness from becoming this person’s reality.\n\nThe effects of homelessness are equally complex and can be mirror images of\nthe root causes. Because the person is experiencing homelessness, this may put\nprofound strain on personal relationships. Drug abuse can become an issue, as\nthe person seeks some way of coping with the pain and hardship of living on the\nstreets.

They\nwere also among the worst-hit during the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19)\n\npandemic, health wise and economically.\n\n8 To respond to these challenges, the FAO report proposed a set of investments\nand policies that have great potential to reactivate the economies of the indigenous\nand tribal territories, mitigate climate change, preserve biological and cultural\n\ndiversity, and reduce social and environmental conflicts.\n\n9 The proposal is based on six pillars: Recognition of collective territorial rights;\nCompensation for environmental services; Community forest management;\nRevitalization of ancestral knowledge; Strengthening of grassroots organizations\n\nand mechanisms for territorial governance.\n\nThis would help in promoting social inclusion and reduce the inequalities that\naffect the indigenous and tribal peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean and go\na long way in improving equitable access to climate finance and to rural economic\n\nrecovery.\n\n10 The first ever Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem\nServices, which assessed the status of biodiversity on the planet, also said that the\nrate of decline in biodiversity is lower in areas where indigenous people own land.\n\nHowever, the knowledge and perspective of the indigenous communities is absent\n\nin the global approaches to conservation. )\n\nNN\n100 ) ;\n\\ English Student Textbook Grade 11"

And then, answer the question\n\nbelow the passage.\n\n(— >\n\nOpportunities for Innovation in Irrigation\n\nGiven the significant effects that climate change may have on the agriculture\nsector and on farming families in particular, irrigation has great potential not only\nin increasing agricultural productivity but also in improving resilience and food\nsecurity in farming families. This in turn empowers women and opens employment\nopportunities. It may be for this reason that there is a surge of interest in irrigation\namong small scale African farmers. At the same time, a growing population across\nthe continent demands more reliable and continuous supply of food. Hence, elevating\nirrigation to a top policy priority and bringing it to the scale required has a lot to\ncontinent. Doing this could help ensure the continent’s food security in the face of\n\nmore extreme weather conditions, and be an engine of agricultural transformation.\n\nIn many countries across Africa, irrigated areas rely on basic or improvised techniques\nsuch as flood recession, spate irrigation, and use of wetlands, all of which are less\nproductive and reliable than modern irrigation technologies. However, there are\nsigns of increasing uptake of on-farm pressurized irrigation technologies, such as\nsprinklers and micro-irrigation, which have potential to reduce water consumption\nand significantly improve the productivity and quality of horticultural crops. On\naverage, 18 percent of areas equipped with modern irrigation technologies in Africa\nnow use pressurized irrigation equipment, compared with just 2 percent in Asia and\n\n12 percent in the rest of the world.\n\nAs can be seen across the continent, there are innovations that can substantially\nincrease countries’ irrigation potential. Because irrigation is highly site-specific\nand not limited to a single method, a range of factors need to be considered in the\nselection of different irrigation innovations and water harvesting methods. Market\nfactors, such as crop prices, energy costs, and labor supply also need to be taken\ninto consideration when developing irrigation technologies and systems. In addition,\nthe costs of technologies, crop and farming characteristics, local climate, regulatory\n\nprovisions such as groundwater pumping restrictions, drainage discharge limits, and\n\nwater transfer provisions will define the effectiveness of the technology applied.

Rainwater harvesting is widespread in many\nAfrican countries, implemented by individual farmers or at the community level.\nUnlike big dams, which collect and store water over large areas, small-scale rainwater\nharvesting loses less water to evaporation, as the rain is collected and stored locally\nthrough runoff from roofs or ground catchment. It does not also deplete aquifers or\nimpact other farmers’ water supply. Of course, the type of storage plays an important\nrole and is determined by material, size, rainfall amounts, water demands, location\n\nand costs.\n\nWater-spreading dams harvest floodwater to distribute the runoff into valleys,\nallowing as much water as possible to infiltrate the soil and hence reach an aquifer.\nWater-spreading dams can be developed using locally available materials, but as\nlarge-scale projects, they require careful planning and construction. In Niger, over\n4,700 farms benefitted directly from water-spreading dams and were able to increase\ntheir arable valley land from 0.6 ha to 2.2 ha on average, with an increase in millet\n\nyields of 85 percent and sorghum yields of 25—30 percent.\n\nS (Source: Adapted from: A Malabo Montpellier Panel Report, 201 wy,\n\nlil.)

Institutions in charge of developing irrigation\noften limit themselves to capital-intensive large-scale plans and they tend to\ndepend on public sector-based approaches. They give little attention to developing\nopportunities for small-scale private financing and irrigation management. Farmers\nand their organizations are often responding to highly distorted incentive frameworks\nin terms of water value and agricultural support policies, which further hinder\n\npositive developments in the sector.\n\nMoreover, most governments and water users fail to invest adequately in the\nmaintenance of irrigation and drainage (I&D) systems. Inadequate management and\noperation may play a part in the poor performance of I &D systems.

There are advantages to both sides; however on balance, I\n\nbelieve that the co-educational system is better than the single.\n\nOn the one hand, there are many advantages of educating boys and girls in the\nsame class room. The first advantage is that children learn to understand the\nopposite sex and to treat each other as equals. Another point is that this system\nreflects society because children are educated in a realistic situation. Moreover,\nit is cheaper to teach boys and girls in one school, an important consideration in\ndeveloping countries. Finally, it can be more fun for everyone as boys and girls\ncan learn to enjoy each other’s company. If children enjoy their education, they\n\nwill probably be more motivated to work hard.\n\nOn the other hand, segregating the sexes has some distinct advantages. Firstly,\nthe academic results at single sex school are often very good as the students not\ndistracted from their work and can concentrate on their studies. Secondly, both\nsexes have the opportunity to express themselves without worrying about what\nthe other sex may think of their opinions. In male-dominated societies, this is\nparticularly important.

What do you think are the challenges affecting Ethiopian National Unity?\n\n( Adwa- A Symbol of National Unity )\n\n(1) The battle of Adwa was a stunning victory for Ethiopia, but a rout and a disaster\nfor Italy. Adwa — the story of Africans seeing to their own freedom — played\nout against a background of almost unrelenting European expansion into Africa.\nThe success of Ethiopia’s forces assured that Ethiopia would be the only African\ncountry successfully to resist European colonization before 1914. It also resonated\npowerfully in post-Emancipation of America where hierarchies of race and ethnicity\n\nwere only beginning a process of challenge and renegotiation.\n\n(2) Italian interest in East Africa dates from 1869, when the opening of the Suez\nCanal transformed the commercial and strategic significance of the Red Sea coast.\nAn official Italian presence didn’t begin until they established themselves at the Red\nSea port of Massawa in 1885, after which the Italians began to move up into what\nare now the Eritrean highlands. Ethiopian commanders sought to halt the Italian\nadvance, with some notable successes, but the Italians artfully played on rivalry\n\namong Ethiopian leaders.\n\n(3) The Italians continued to push westward, into the Sudan, and southward, toward\nthe northern Ethiopian province of Tigray. By 1890, the Italians had secured control\nover a significant territory west and south of Massawa; they announced the creation\nof the colony of Eritrea, with a capital at Asmara. In late 1894 Ras Mangasha, the\nruler of Tigray, used the pretext of war against the Dervishes to mobilize forces to\nresist Italian incursions. In a series of victories in early 1895, the Italians defeated\nMangasha’s forces. They pursued Mangasha deep into northern Ethiopia, establishing\nfortified positions in Tigray provinces — vastly expanding the territory under Italian\n\ncontrol.\n\n(4) In September 1895, Menelik, king of the southern province of Shoa, called the\npopulation of Ethiopia to arms. He began to lead a force of some 100,000 men\nnorthward toward the Italian-occupied territories. Through late 1895 and into the\nearly months of 1896, Menelik led a brilliant campaign that forced the overextended\n\nItalians to fight on his terms. General Baratieri was reluctant to attack Menelik’s\n\n(amy in the open field. y\n\nEnglish Student Textbook Grade 11 ¢ 173 )"

However, some of Baratieri’s officers argued forcefully against\nretreat, citing spy reports to the effect that Menelik’s forces were demoralized and\ndepleted. Baratieri agreed to a plan that called for his army of some 15,000 to\nadvance under cover of night and occupy forward positions, a move that would have\nforced Menelik to lose face if he declined to attack Italian forces holding strong\n\ndefensive positions.\n\n(5) By outflanking the Italian forces, Menelik maneuvered the Italians into a position\nthat left their supply lines exposed, vulnerable to a population that was now turning\nagainst the occupiers. In March 1896 a well-disciplined and massive Ethiopian army\ndid the unthinkable - it routed an invading Italian force and brought Italy’s war of\nconquest in Africa to an end. In an age of relentless European expansion, Ethiopia had\nsuccessfully defended its independence and cast doubt upon an unshakable certainty\nof the age - that sooner or later all Africans would fall under the rule of Europeans.\nThis event opened a breach that would lead, in the aftermath of world war, fifty\n\nyears later, to the continent’s painful struggle for freedom from colonial rule.\n\n(6) Europeans and European-Americans interpreted the story of Adwa in different\nways. For some, it was an opportunity to discredit Italy militarily. For others, it was\nimportant to advance the view that the Ethiopians were not black, thus explaining\naway the significance of white and European defeat. The victory at Adwa sealed\nthe unification of Ethiopia and solidified Menelik’s claim to the title of Emperor.\nEthiopian victory secured independence for more than a generation. It also assured\n\nEthiopia’s status as a beacon throughout the African Diaspora.\n\nS (Adapted from: The Battle of Adwa: African Victory in the Age of Empire, Cambridge: HUP, 2011 ))\n\nSay “True” or “False” to the following statements based on the\n\ninformation in the reading text.\n\n1.

            "text": "UNIT 7 Patriotism\n\nTips on Word Relationship\n\nContext clues are hints found within a sentence, paragraph, or passage that a\nreader can use to understand the meanings of new or unfamiliar words. A reader\nshould rely on context clues when an obvious clue to meaning is provided, or\nwhen only a general sense of the meaning is needed for the reader’s purposes.\nContext clues typically fall into four categories: Definition, synonym, antonym,\n\nexample, and general sense of the sentence.\n\nDefinition: The new term may be formally defined, or sufficient explanation may\nbe given within the sentence or in the following sentence. Clues to definition\ninclude “that is,” commas, dashes, and parentheses. Example: a. His emaciation,\nthat is, his skeleton-like appearance, was frightening to see. “Skeleton-like\n\nappearance” is the definition of “emaciation.”\n\nA synonym context clue means that there is a word in the sentence that contains\nthe same meaning as the word you may not know. E.g. “The math test was\narduous; students spent the entire class working on the difficult exam, and many\n\nneeded extra time just to complete it”.\n\nAn antonym context clue means the opposite of what another word means.\nExample: “The class completed the easy grammar test in thirty minutes, but the\n\narduous math test took the entire class period”.\n\nThe example: is another context clue type. Sentences with these types of context\nclues give illustrations of the difficult word. Example: “Our pond is home to\namphibious creatures such as frogs and turtles, which enjoy swimming in the clear\n\nwater’.\n“General sense of the sentence” is also a great help when decoding words. Here,\n\nwe simply look at what the sentence is saying and figure out the meaning of an\n\nunknown word. E.g. “The student received an expeditious answer to her email\n\nbecause her instructor was online and answering student questions.”\n\n> yy,\n\n( ) English Student Textbook Grade 11"

To start,\nthere are five types of adverbs you should familiarize yourself with: adverbs of\n\nmanner, frequency, degree, place, and time.\n\nAdverbs of Manner: tell us how, or in what manner, something is carried out.\nThey mostly modify verbs and can often be found at the end of a clause or right\nbefore the word they modify. This category usually end in -ly. E.g. beautifully,\n\ngenerously, happily, well, formally, sincerely.\n\nAdverbs of Degree/intensity: tell us more about the intensity of the verb in the\nsentence. They describe how much, or to what degree, something happened. E.g.\n\nalmost, enough, hardly, just, nearly, quite, simply, so, too.\n\nAdverbs of Frequency: let us know how often something occurs. These adverbs\ntend to appear right before the main verb in the sentence or at the end of the clause.\nE.g, again, always, every (hour, day, week, year, and so on), never, normally,\n\nrarely, seldom, sometimes, usually.\n\nAdverbs of Place: tell us more about where the verb took place. Common\nadverbs of place include: above, anywhere, back, below, everywhere, here, inside,\n\nnowhere, out, outside, there.\n\nAdverbs of Time: detail when the verb takes place.

Some adjectives\nhowever, are only attributive adjectives, which can only come immediately\nbefore a noun and not anywhere else in the sentence. These adjectives include the\nfollowing: chief, elder, former, indoor, inner, main, mere, only, outdoor, outer,\nparticular, principal, sole and upper.\n\n(2) Adjective that comes after a noun is called a predicative adjective\n\nA predicative adjective in a sentence appears after a noun. It acts as a predicate\nas it completes the meaning of the predicate. The predicative adjective does not\nappear immediately after the noun. The noun is usually followed by a linking\nverb be (am, is, are, was, were, appear, look, taste, etc). The predicative adjective\n\ncomes after the linking verb and also acts as a complement. E.g. The girl looks\n\nhappy.\nThere are adjectives that can be used only as predicative adjectives. A group of\nthese adjectives begins with the alphabet a (ablaze, adrift, afloat, afraid, aghast,\n\nalert, alike, alive, alone, aloof, ashamed, asleep, averse, aware, awake) and they\n\n> usually come after a linking verb.\n\nS\nEnglish Student Textbook Grade 11 ¢ 187 )"

I may not have enough money, ?\n\nLanguage Tip on Question tags:\n\nTag Questions are small questions (usually of two words) inserted at the end of\nstatements. We use tag questions to confirm information (to check the listener’s\nposition in relation to the statement) or to ask for new information (in relation to\nthe statement). Tag questions are very common in spoken English and they are\nkey to improve one’s fluency. Unlike the normal questions, the answers to tag\nquestions are obvious or are expected by the speaker. That is why, tag questions are\nsometimes regarded as ‘talking to oneself’\nThe statements before the tag question can either be negative or affirmative, but\nthe question tags always follow the pattern: negative after an affirmative statement\nand vice versa. That means, if the statement is negative, the question tag must be\npositive and if the statement is positive, then the question tag must be negative. We\nuse tag questions to confirm information (to check the listener’s position in relation\nto the statement) or to ask for new information (in relation to the statement). These\nare two of the basic rules in forming tag questions.\n\nExample: You cooked this yourself, didn’t you?\n\nYou have not done your homework, have you?\n\nThe other rules related to tag question formation are connected with imperatives,\nnegative adverbs, negative subjects, and in cases where ‘indefinite impersonal\nONE’ is used as subject\n\nImperatives\nSometimes we use question tags with imperatives (invitations, orders), but the\nsentence remains an imperative and does not require a direct answer. We use won’t\nfor invitations. We use can, can’t, will, would for orders.\n\n1. Give me a hand, will you?\n\n2. Hurry up, won’t you?\n\n3. Close the door, would you?\n\nS\\\n\n198 \\\n( ) .

Even though they may be in a positive statement, the feeling of the statement\nis negative. We treat statements with these words like negative statements, so the\nquestion tag is normally positive. Look at these examples:\n\n1. She hardly completes her homework on time, does she?\n\n2.

As each state brings new surroundings, our anticipation builds,\n\nand home seems closer all the time.\n\nLeaving the flatlands and entering an area where we are suddenly surrounded by\nhills of purple and blue are by far the most awakening moments.

            "text": "Patriotism UNIT 7\n\nLanguage Tip on Descriptive Essay Writings\n\ne Descriptive writing helps the reader visualize the person, place, thing, or\nsituation being described. Descriptive writings are based more on “show” than\n“tell” -- giving readers a visual idea of the subject. Through vivid depictions,\nthe writer conveys to readers individual impressions based on emotions or\nperceptions. When a text conjures a vivid, sensory impression in the reader’s\nmind, not only does it make the writing more interesting to read; it helps the\nreader understand the text better and recognize the author’s intention more\n\nclearly.\n\ne Descriptive writing makes use of the five senses. The writer effectively\nconveys personal perceptions on the subject through the use of sensory details\nand figurative expressions. A descriptive writing (especially subjective one)\nprovides a good platform for the writer to express his/her feelings on a subject.\nIt helps the writer make writing more interesting and engaging to read. It also\ncreates opportunities to practice using new words in meaningful contexts, and\n\nso is a key strategy for building vocabulary.\n\ne Adescriptive essay should be interesting to read. To make the essay\nappealing, the writer needs to consider audience preferences, and use words\nand descriptions that attract readers’ interest. The essay generally includes an\nintroduction, body and conclusion centered on a chosen theme. The writing\nstyle is expressive and may include descriptions, opinions, comparisons,\npersonal perceptions and sensory perceptions. The main objective of a\ndescriptive essay is to relate the unique qualities of the person, object, etc.\n\nvividly and comprehensively.\n\ne Adescriptive essay can be either objective (concrete, factual) or subjective\n(personal). The type of essay that a writer creates will be determined by the\nkind of emotion that the writer wants to elicit from readers. Presenting a purely\nobjective can be difficult. Conversely, a writer can reduce subjectivity in an\n\nessay by including more objective factors, like size, color, shape and distance,\n\nexhausting them before injecting personal opinions or feelings.\n\n) yy,\n\nEnglish Student Textbook Grade 11 ¢ 203 )"

They also believe it will encourage more people\nto read because they won’t have to travel to a library to get a book; they can simply\nclick on what they want to read and read it from wherever they are. They could\nalso access more materials because libraries won’t have to buy physical copies of\n\nbooks; they can simply rent out as many digital copies as they need.\n\nHowever, it would be a serious mistake to replace libraries with tablets. First,\ndigital books and resources are associated with less learning and more problems\nthan print resources. A study done on tablet vs book reading found that people\nread 20-30% slower on tablets, retain 20% less information, and understand 10%\nless of what they read compared to people who read the same information in print.\nAdditionally, staring too long at a screen has been shown to cause numerous health\nproblems, including blurred vision, dizziness, dry eyes, headaches, and eye strain,\nat much higher instances than reading print does. People who use tablets and\nmobile devices excessively also have a higher incidence of more serious health\nissues such as fibromyalgia, shoulder and back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and\nmuscle strain. I know that whenever I read from my e-reader for too long, my eyes\nbegin to feel tired and my neck hurts. We should not add to these problems by\n\ngiving people, especially young people, more reasons to look at screens.\n\nSecond, it is incredibly narrow-minded to assume that the only service libraries\noffer is book lending. Libraries have a multitude of benefits, and many are only\navailable if the library has a physical location. Some of these benefits include\nacting as a quiet study space, giving people a way to converse with their neighbors,\nholding classes on a variety of topics, providing jobs, answering patron questions,\nand keeping the community connected. One neighborhood found that, after a local\nlibrary instituted community events such as play times for toddlers and parents,\n\njob fairs for teenagers, and meeting spaces for senior citizens, over a third of\n\n\\_ Tesidents reported feeling more connected to their community.

How often do they go to courts?\n\n2. Do people in area have traditional mechanisms of solving conflicts? If so, who\nparticipate in the practices?\n\n3. Look at the title of the reading passage. What do you expect to learn from the\n\nreading text?\n\nStrategies of Indigenous Conflict Resolution\n\n1) Societies world-wide have long used indigenous mechanisms to prevent and\nresolve conflicts. In every community, systems of indigenous conflict resolution\nare often based on community customs, familial relationships, or are embedded in\ninstitutional practices run alongside the formal state sanctioned processes. These\nsystems are often known by different names: unofficial law, traditional institution\nof conflict resolution, traditional justice systems, non-state laws, customary dispute\nresolution mechanisms, restorative justice, and alternative dispute resolution. For\nthe sake of consistency and proper contextualization of the concept, however, the\nterm ‘popular dispute resolution mechanisms’ (PDRMs) is used here. The term\n\n‘popular’ is preferred over others because this word is closely associated with the\n\nbroad masses involved in conflict resolution practices.\n\n2) PDRMs have a long history in Ethiopia. They have been practiced for many\ncenturies. In the ancient days and most especially under the Fetha Negast [law\nof the kings], conflicts between individuals or communities were encouraged to\nbe settled amicably at local levels. Elders-Shimagelle - or people appointed on\nad-hoc basis played an important role in resolving conflicts. Even today, these\nmechanisms are widely practiced among various ethnic groups. For instance, the\ninstitutions of Gadaa among the Oromo, the Shimgillina of the Amhara and other\nethnic groups are practiced. Moreover, even after passing through the procedures\n\nand penalties in the criminal court, some indigenous Ethiopians tend to use PDRMs\n\n\\_ for reconciliation and in order to control acts of revenge.

            "text": "UNIT 9 Indigenous Conflict Resolution\n\n( Itis very common to see many rural and village communities referring complaints\n\nnot to police or prosecuting authorities, rather to agents of indigenous institutions.\n\n3) However, regardless of their wider popular acceptance throughout the country,\nPDRMs have been marginalized since the 1950s and 1960s. This was actually\nthe time when the imperial regime was engaged in extensive codification and\noverhauling the existing laws with the aim of unifying and modernizing the laws.\nThis was also a trend observed in most African countries, aftermath of Slave Trade\n\nand Colonialism.\n\n4) As a result, PDRMs are not recognized by the law and not properly organized.\nProper attention is not given to protect, develop, and utilize indigenous conflict\nresolution mechanisms in the development process. In a society where poverty\nand illiteracy prevail, and where judicial processes are less accessible to and\ncostly for the ordinary citizens, traditional conflict resolution stands out as the\nbest method of conflict resolution. Of course, during the enactment of the codified\nlaws, in the Imperial period, PDRMs related to family relations and interpretations\nof contracts were incorporated as long as they did not contradict the Codes. Most\nof these conciliatory practices were designed to be used under the supervision and\n\nrecommendation of the formal courts that functioned under the new Codes\n\n5) Currently, both government officials and researchers have accepted the\n\ninternational and regional tendency to synchronize and apply PDRMs in the\n\ncountry’s justice system. They have demonstrated their commitment by hosting\nnational and regional forums, conferences and workshops; establishing research\ninstitutions and centers as well as sponsoring scholars who conduct research on\nPDRMs. The practical experience shows that the majority of the people are in\n\nfavor of this consensus. This is a very great leap forward.\n\n\\ (Source: Adapted from Journal of Indigenous Social Development, Volume 7, Issue 2 , 2018) )\n\nFind words from the reading text whose contextual meanings are similar\nto the ones given below.

His impressive accomplishments are a testament to\nfollowing one’s dreams, persevering in the face of obstacles, and realizing one’s\nvision. The most difficult undertaking of Brunelleschi’s career was the dome of\nFlorence Cathedral, which took sixteen years to construct. A major blow to the\nprogress of the construction happened in 1428.

A case is the function of a noun or pronoun in a sentence. There are three\ncases in the modern English language; they are nominative, genitive and accusative.\nThe nominative case marks the subject, genitive case refers to the possessive form\nand the accusative case refers to the object. Therefore, the main difference between\nnominative and accusative is, nominative marks the subject while the accusative\nmarks the object. When a noun or a pronoun functions as the subject of a verb,\nit is said to be in the nominative case. The nominative case is also known as the\nsubjective case. In the following sentences, nouns and pronouns in the nominative\ncase are underlined. E.g. She became the President in 1991.Jim and Huck travelled\nby boat. The little girl is crying.\n\nAccusative case refers to a noun or pronoun that acts as either the direct or indirect\n\nobject of a verb or the object of a preposition. The accusative case is also known as\n\n> the objective case. y\n\nEnglish Student Textbook Grade 11 ¢ 245 )"

The past\ncontinuous tense is formed by combining the past tense of to be (1.e., was/were) with\nthe verb’s present participle (-ing word). There are many situations in which this verb\ntense might be used in a sentence. For example, it is often used to describe conditions\n\nthat existed in the past.\n\n¢ The sun was shining every day that summer.\n\n¢ As I spoke, the children were laughing at my cleverness.\n\nIt can also be used to describe something that was happening continuously in the past\nwhen another action interrupted it.\n¢ The audience was applauding until he fell off the stage.\n¢ Iwas making dinner when she arrived.\n¢ The past continuous can shed light on what was happening at a precise time in\nthe past.\n\n¢ At6o’clock, I was eating dinner.\n\nIt can also refer to a habitual action in the past; E.g. She was talking constantly in\n\nclass.\n\n> y,\n\n248 \\\n( ) . English Student Textbook Grade 11"

            "text": "Indigenous Conflict Resolution UNIT 9\n\n(One final caution: Though the irregularities are few, not every verb is suited toN,\ndescribing a continuous action. Certain verbs can’t be used in the past continuous\ntense. One common example is the verb to arrive.\n\ne At noon, he was arriving (wrong)\n\n¢ At noon, he arrived (right)\n\nThe past perfect continuous tense (also known as the past perfect progressive tense)\nshows that an action that started in the past continued up until another time in the\npast. The past perfect continuous tense is constructed using had been + the verb’s\npresent participle (root + -ing).\nThe past perfect continuous is a verb tense that indicates something that began in the\npast, continued in the past, and also ended at a defined point in the past.\nE.g. He had been drinking milk out the carton when Mom walked into the kitchen.\n“When”, “for’’, “since”, and “before” are words that you may see used alongside the\npast perfect continuous tense.\n\n¢ Martha had been walking three miles a day before she broke her leg.\n\n¢ The program that was terminated had been working well since 1945.\n\n¢ He had been throwing rocks at her window for five minutes before she finally\n\ncame out on the balcony and said, “Hey, Romeo.”\n\nBoth past continuous and past perfect continuous tenses are useful to tell stories. It\nmay be difficult to conceptualize their difference. However, it would be better if you\n\nlearn past simple and past continuous together and the past perfect continuous along\n\nwith the past simple and the past perfect tenses. y\n\nES (OF Writing Skills )\n\n( 9F1 Cohesive Device, and Thesis Statement in Expository Texts y\n\nIn this sub-section for practicing the writing skills, you learn the use of cohesive devices\n\nand how to identify thesis statement of an expository essay.\n\nActivity 9.11\n\nBefore getting into the details of the topic, give your ideas on the following\ntriggerring questions.

Precious leisure\ntime can be used to decompress using meaningful but still relaxing activities.\nLeisure time should contribute to a student’s physical, mental and spiritual well-\n\nbeing. These three areas will contribute to a more wholesome student.\n\nExercise and Sport\n\nGiven that most classes are sedentary activities, a student should spend their time\nget their bodies active through exercise and other physical activities. Leisure time\ncan be used as a way to look after your health. The body’s well-being undoubtedly\nconstitutes the physical aspect. When a student is in better physical shape, their\nconcentration, energy levels and participation in class also increase. Most students\nsit while in class. Medical research shows that prolonged sessions of unadulterated\nsitting have adverse effects on the body’s health by exercising during their leisure\ntime, students can counteract these negative consequences. Exercise can include\nendurance activities such as running, swimming, martial arts and bike riding.\nIt could also include power exercises such as weightlifting. Sports are also an\nexcellent choice in this regard. You get to work your body out while having fun at\n\nthe same time.\n\nArtistic Pursuits\n\nStudents should be involved in arts during their leisure time.

The arts could teach a student how to live\npassionately which is solely lacking in the modern world. A student gains much\nvirtue from drawing, painting, and writing among other arts. Such virtues spill\n\nover into other areas of their lives.\n\nRelaxation\n\nRelaxation brings about the tranquility that a student cannot find anywhere else.\nIn modern society’s hurried ways, to slow down even for a few minutes each day\nwill bring peace to a student’s life. It helps to achieve peace of mind. A student\ncan calm down and see what is crucial in their lives. Every endeavor is carried\nout with more clarity.

Descriptive, qualitative or attributive adjective: A descriptive, qualitative\nor attributive adjective is one that shows the kind and quality of a person or\nthing. For example, “A brave person’”,“A beautiful child’,““A careful mother.”\nSome attributive adjectives are derived from nouns, e.g. a Jaw college,\n\na flower garden, pay-day.\n\n3. Quantitative adjective: A quantitative adjective is one that shows how much\n\n(quantity) of a thing is meant. For examples:\n\nI did not eat any apple; he ate much bread; you drink Jittle milk.\n\nA quantitative adjective is always followed by a singular material or abstract\nnoun.\n4. Numeral adjectives: A numeral adjective is one that shows the number or\n\nserial order of persons or things. They are further divided into two main classes.\n\n5. Demonstrative adjective: A demonstrative adjective is one that points out\n\nwhich person or thing is meant, e.g. this boy, that person, those men.\n\n6. Distributive adjective: A distributive adjective is one that refers to each one of\n\nanumber. They are four in number; each, every, either, neither.\n\n7. Interrogative adjective: An interrogative adjective is used to ask a question.\n\nFor example, “whose pen is this?” ““Which flower do you like best?”\n\n8.
