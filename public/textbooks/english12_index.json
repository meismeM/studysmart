            "text": "UNIT     1 Sustainable Development \nENGLISH STUDENT  TEXTBOOK  GRADE 126Note:\nIn English, the suffix ‘-s’ is used to mark plural in nouns, singular forms of verbs, \npossessiveness or contracted forms. However, it is pronounced differently. Follow the examples. \nExample: buses /-iz/   texts /-s/    bags /-z/ Pronunciation tips: \n• If words end in /s/, /t∫/, /dʒ/, /z/, / ∫ /, /ʒ/ sounds the ‘_s’  is pronounced as /-iz/.\n• If words end in /b/, /d/, /g/, /l/, /m/, /n/, /ŋ/, /r/, /D/, /ò/, /v/ sounds the ‘s’  is \npronounced as /-z/.\n• If words end in /f/, /k/ /p/, /t/, /θ/ sounds the ‘-s’ is pronounced as /-s/\n• Past morpheme /-d/: In English, regular verbs take the suffix /-(e)d/ to mark past \ntense. Past morphemes added to regular verbs –d, or -ed are pronounced as /-t/, /-d/ or /-id/.\nPronunciation Tips:\nThere are three simple rules that help to pronounce past morphemes correctly . \n• If the verb base ends with a voiceless sound, /p/,/ f/,/ k/,/ s/,/ sh/, /ch/,/ th/ then the \nending –ed sounds like “t”.\n• If the verb base ends in a voiced sound,/ b/, /v/, /g/, /z/, /j/, /th/, /l/, /m,/ /n/, /r / then the ending –ed sounds like “d”.\n• If the verb base ends in a “t” or “d” sound then the ending sounds like “id” or \n“ud”.\n1B.2 Pair Discussion\n V     Activity 1.4\nI.

The world has committed to 17 integrated SDGs to keep the development of nations on a growing path. This ambitious and transformative agenda has a lifespan of fifteen years, terminating in 2030. It is an intensified development initiative that \nembodies universal aspirations for achieving a better, more just, equitable, peaceful and sustainable future. Thus, the achievement of the 2030 Agenda will definitely requires the participation of all stakeholders. In Ethiopia, as shown in the analysis of its development laws, one can understand that there is an enabling environment to collaborate and promote sustainable development. The constitutional support, government initiated development projects and growing interest in environmental conservation can be mentioned as a move towards the goals. However, there are a number of factors that have slowed down or held back the full realization of the agenda. \nFor example, the FDRE Constitution promotes the adoption of a viable model and \nlegal framework for sustainable development, but there seems to be lack of strong political commitment to fully implement existing laws. There are also legal gaps that limit the practicality of the envisioned goals.  Two legal gaps that can be mentioned in this regard are the absence of supplementary laws and lack of regulations that support environmental impact assessment system. As the declaration on sustainable development is not supported by supplementary laws, there is a problem of delineating the boundary in which stakeholders can operate.  Additional opportunity for effective implementation is missed, as there are no sectorial laws that provide opportunity to mainstream environmental impact assessment systems. This is irrefutable evidence that there is a weak political will in protecting the environment."

However, this is done without considering the adverse effect inflicted as a result inclining towards one of the pillars of sustainable development. Sustainable development can only be realized when the three pillars of development namely, economic, environment and social aspects are given equal emphasis.  Nevertheless, what is observed in Ethiopia is a commitment to promote investment and other development projects at the expense of environmental protection. Thus, prioritizing one pillar of development over the other has become the other challenge for realizing SDGs. \nThe institutions that are working on sustainable developmen also lack synergy and \nthat is the other challenge.  Achieving sustainable development, particularly the \nSDGs, is possible only with synergy at international and national levels. That is why, the 2030 agenda put revitalizing partnership and interconnections as cornerstones \nfor the realization of SDGs. However, the global dedication for SDGs is not very encouraging, as a number of commitments on trade, aid, investment, and financing the Least Developed Countries have not been significantly met. In Ethiopia, too, lack of synergy is discovered as a cross-cutting issue, as the environmental agencies have not \nyet developed good communication culture among themselves.\nSeen from the perspectives of having qualified consultants and responsible institutions, \nthe existing institutional capacity is weak and poses another challenge. First, most consultants in the country are not well qualified to carry out Environmental Impact Analysis and report it effectively. \nBesides this, there are consultants who are ready to compromise their responsibilities \nto their clients’ interest. Likewise, most government offices place themselves at a higher \nlevel and do not want to become accountable to Environmental Protection Authority, and this prevents the authority from regulating the activities of these offices.\nTo conclude, the challenges seizing the full implementation of sustainable development \nneed to be vigorously addressed. There should be a strong political will to enact existing \nlaws and to draft sectorial laws. Then, the implementors should be empowered to fully employ the laws. Besides, institutions such as environmental agencies and investment authorities should pay equal attention to pillars of SDGs. These institutions are also required to be committed and accountable to their actions. \nAdapted from Journal of Sustainable Development Law and Policy (December, 2018)"

If you are effective in time management, \na) you will have a balanced life.\nb) you will procrastinate.c) you have to worry about success and productivity.d) you can’t meet a deadline.\nTime Management and Productivity\nTime management is highly important if you want to be productive in your school life, but you don’t have to sacrifice your physical and mental health in the process. By following effective management techniques, you can balance the stress of school and life.\nTime management refers to your capability to plan and control how you devote \nyour day to effectively accomplish the goals you’ve set. This includes allocating time among each of the spheres of your life, work, family and social life.  Since everyone’s goals are different and carry a different weight, it’s important to set clear priorities to separate time wasters from the activities that really matter. Poor time \nmanagement skills can not only lead to   procrastination  but can cause unnecessary \nworry and wear away your overall quality of life.\nTime management is perhaps the single most important skill that will help a student \nsucceed. How well a student manages his or her time will also affect overall well-being at the end of the week, at the end of the term or at the end of the year. Staying on top of coursework requires some planning and commitment to stick to scheduled study times.\nThere are some tried-and-true methods that can help you master time management. \nLike any habit you develop, you can become better at it through practice. \n It’s difficult to use time wisely if you don’t know what to do with it. Students \ncan benefit from having short- and long-term goals. For example, a short-term goal might include completing their homework early each day, so they have ample time for other personal activities. Their long term goal could be to study for the forthcoming national exams."

Writing down deadlines for each one and breaking longer-term assignments into tasks with their own deadlines can help you avoid beginning a major project at the last minute.\nIn like manner, setting time limits on specific tasks is important.  Just because you \nspend a lot of time on a given assignment doesn’t mean you’ve spent that time \nwisely.   By assessing what needs to be achieved within a given timeframe, tasks \ncan be rated according to their importance. Setting priorities for each day, week, month and year can help students accomplish their goals. It also helps to make sure activities that are very important but not urgent – such as personal devotions, adequate sleep and exercise – are given priority. Some people like to prioritize easy tasks for early in the day and use the boost to move forward. Others prefer to tackle bigger jobs first.\nManaging time wisely will help to find the right balance between time and work. \nA few students resort to multi-tasking in order to get the work done within the specified time limit. At times, this may result in poor performance in the various tasks assigned.\nSocial media usage and internet surfing are temptations to students efficient time \nmanagement. These days, students at all levels are highly addicted to these time-wasters. Whenever you are on task doing your assignment or studying, make sure that you put your phone away and close browser windows as they can take attention away from the task at hand. In order not to lose focus, use technology wisely. \nBeing a secondary school student doesn’t have to mean your life is all work and no \nplay. It’s just as important to pencil in breaks, exercise and time with friends and family as it is to schedule time for studying. Nobody performs at their uttermost under excessive stress. Since students need healthy ways to manage the pressures of study while maintaining productivity, getting enough sleep and exercising are \nall great ways to minimize stress, and actually make learning more effective.   The \nmajor mistake committed while working is when one is in a rush to meet the deadline without taking proper breaks for rest or relaxation. It is impossible for anyone to focus on work and to produce good results without considering any \nbreak in between."

Most of the times, daily chores and the environment will structure the day.\n Note down the Ethiopian village woman’s everyday schedule. For example, \nmost Ethiopian village women….. \n• Wake up at the early in the morning and washes her face.\n• Light the fire and prepares meals for the household.\n• Sweep the yard, etc.\nV. Then, write a story on the Ethiopian women’s time management. Share \nyour story orally  first, to your partner and then to the whole class. \nCultural Views of Time Management\nIf you show up  a bit late for a meeting in Ethiopia, no one will be too worried. \nBut if you keep someone in Western countries waiting for  ten or fifteen minutes, \nyou may have some explanation to do. Time is seen as relatively flexible in some cultures but is viewed more rigidly in others. Indeed, the way members of a culture perceive and use time tells us about their society’s priorities, and even their own personal view of the world.\nDifferences in the way a culture views time can affect the way their time is \nmanaged. For example, a  linear time  view is a way of conceiving time as flowing \nfrom one moment to the next in a linear fashion. This linear perception of time is \npredominant in America along with most Northern European countries, such as \nGermany, Switzerland, and England.  People in these cultures tend to place a large \nvalue on productive time management, and tend to avoid decisions or actions that would result in\n wasted time.  This linear view of time correlates to these cultures \nbeing more “monochronic”, or preferring to do only one thing at a time. Generally speaking, this cultural view leads to a better focus on accomplishing a singular task and hence, more productive time management."

In multi-active cultures, most \npeople feel that the more activities or tasks being done at once the better. This \ncreates a sense of happiness. Multi-active cultures are “polychronic” or prefer to do multiple tasks at once. This multi-active time view is prominent in most Southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy. In these cultures, the people often tend to spend time on things they deem to be more important such as placing a high importance on\n finishing social conversations.  In business \nenvironments, they often pay little attention to how long meetings last; rather the focus is on having high quality meetings. In general, the cultural focus tends to be on synergy and creativity over efficiency.\nA final cultural time view is a  cyclical time  view. In cyclical cultures, time is \nconsidered neither linear nor event related. Because days, months, years, seasons, and events happen in regular repetitive occurrences, time is viewed as cyclical. In this view, time is not seen as wasted because it will always come back later, hence \nthere is an unlimited amount of it.  This cyclical time view is prevalent throughout \nmost countries in Asia, including Japan and China. It is more important in cultures with cyclical concepts of time to complete tasks correctly, therefore most people will spend more time thinking about decisions and the impact they will have, before \nacting on their plans.  Most people in cyclical cultures tend to understand that other \ncultures have different perspectives of time and are cognizant of this when acting on a global stage. \n(Adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Cultural_views_of_time_\nmanagement)\nVI.

A further reason for completing a college degree is that the knowledge you get from college makes your life more pleasurable. For example, if you take introduction to music history, you become familiar with the different musical periods and styles. You start to enjoy the classical music that you listen to, because now you understand more about it. When you study literature, you get a better understanding of the beauty of poetry. You will notice that college subjects not only make you more knowledgeable; they bring more pleasure to your life.\n2. College degrees are becoming more and more common. Twenty years ago, most people (if they were lucky) had only a high school certificate, and that was enough to get them a job. Some people now believe that college degrees are so common that they are not so important anymore. What counts is the experience that a person has for a job. However, I believe that, even though college degrees are more common these days, they are still important and worth the effort.\n3. A final reason for getting a college degree is that it shapes your character. In order to be successful in college, you need to learn to manage your time. You also need to be responsible and work hard, do all your assignments and study well for all your tests. In addition, you learn to deal with frustrations, such as low grades or tiredness. You learn to persevere and keep trying. This is very good training for the frustrations you will have in your job and in your life later on.\n4. One important reason for getting a college degree is that a college degree gives you the basic information and preparation that you need to get a good job. College courses are organized so that you can get the information you need about a certain job. College courses teach you skills for that job. Of course, college courses cannot teach you everything you need to know, but they give you the basics, enough information for you to be prepared. They also teach you how you can get the information that you don’t have. Therefore, in order to get a good job preparation, it is a good idea to complete a college degree\nThe right order is: __________, ___________, ____________, __________"

Point out the major causes of road traffic accidents in Ethiopia. \nMagnitude of Road Traffic Accident\nRoad traffic accident is a major public health and development challenge. Every year \nnearly 1.3 million people lose their lives on the road and as many as 50 million others are injured. Globally 17 road fatalities  per 100,000 populations per annum are \nreported. Road traffic accident is the second leading cause of death in economically active population group of 15–44 years of age; further, more than 75% of Road traffic accident casualties occur in this age group. In many countries, the estimated economic loss due to road traffic accidents is as high as 3% of their gross domestic products.\nThe burden of road traffic accident is disproportionally high in low- and middle-\nincome countries where over 85% fatalities and 90% of disability-adjusted life are \nreported. Fatalities related to road traffic accident are at least two-times common in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. The average death rate in middle low – and middle- income countries is 23.6 per 100,1000 population. Globally road traffic accident fatalities remain more or less constant since 2007. However, in many developing countries the rates are increasing. Especially, Africa faces the highest annual rate of road fatalities in the world– 27 per 100,000 populations. Rate of road traffic death between 2013 and 2017 was 26.6 per 100,000 populations. In the next few decades, the problem can even rise due to the ongoing rapid economic growth and increase in motorization in the continent."

A large body of evidence suggests that road traffic accidents are easily preventable and many high income countries have successfully reduced the incidence through proven and cost-effective interventions. The Sustainable Development Goals, Goal-3, sets an ambitious target to halve the global number of fatalities and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020.\nLike many African countries, Ethiopia is facing enormous road safety crisis. \nAccording to the estimate of the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence  \nof road traffic fatality in Ethiopia was 25.3 per 100,000 populations and the rate is among the highest in the world. Factors contributing to the high incidence of road traffic accidents in Ethiopia include rampant reckless driving behaviors, poor \nroad network, substandard road conditions, failure to enforce traffic laws and poor conditions of vehicles. \nRoad traffic accident also brings huge economic loss to the global economy in \nevery fiscal year. Reports on the road traffic crashes indicate that cost of developing countries reaches between 1–2% of their Gross Domestic Product.  Ethiopia is one of developing country with high traffic accidents, costing the country around 0.8% - 0.9% of the GDP, around 1.3 billion dollars. Globally, the annual cost of road crashes is in excess of 500 billion dollars, and in the developing world the estimated cost is about 65 billion dollars each year. In African, the current estimate of cost of accidents is 3.7 billion dollars per year.\n                                           (Adapted from WHO, 2018 report)\nVI.

Middle Income and High Income Countries  \n Reading text B: \nEvidence on Road Traffic Accident\nThe number of vehicles per inhabitant is still low in Africa: less than one licensed vehicle per 100 inhabitants in low-income Africa versus 60 in high-income countries. Fleet growth leads to increased road insecurity in developing countries. This explains, for example, the reported 400% increase in road deaths in Nigeria between the 1960s and the 1980s. Available historical data from developed countries show that the road mortality starts to decrease only when a development threshold is achieved. Such a threshold is far from being reached in sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, in South Africa, the most developed African country, there were already 17 licensed vehicles per 100 inhabitants in 2005, but no decline in road traffic deaths has been observed so far . \nAfrican nations dominate the list, in the WHO report highlighting the gap between \nhigh-income countries and low- and middle-income countries. Of all  road traffic \ndeaths, 90% occur in developing  countries despite low- and middle-income countries \nhave only 54% of the world’s vehicles.  As the report points out, there’s a significant link between the risk of road traffic deaths and a country’s income level. While road traffic deaths in high-income countries average 8.3 deaths per 100,000 people, in low-income countries the average is 27.5 deaths per 100,000—a more than three-fold increase.\nThe severity of road traffic crashes is also likely to be much greater in Africa than \nanywhere else, because many vulnerable road users are involved, but also because of the poor transport conditions such as lack of seat belts, overcrowding, and hazardous vehicle environments."

            "text": "UNIT     3 Evidence on Traffic Accident\nENGLISH STUDENT  TEXTBOOK  GRADE 1264Sub-Saharan Africa is the global capital for road traffic deaths. The World Health \nOrganization has released its  Global Road Safety report 2018, and named Libya as \nthe nation with the highest rate of road traffic deaths – some 73.4 deaths per 100,000 \npeople every year. Following Libya in second place is Thailand, with a rate of 36.2 –by more than half smaller than Libya’s. The third is Malawi, with a rate of 35 deaths per 100,000. In some countries the reported deaths are very low, for example 22 in Chad, 43 in Gabon, 58 in Central African Republic. There may indeed be relatively few road deaths in these countries but it is much more likely that they are significantly under-reported.\nTwo countries alone account for almost fifty per cent of all reported deaths, namely \nSouth Africa and Nigeria. The South African value of over 9,000 appears to be consistent over time. For example, it was at about the same value in the mid 1980’s. Nigeria on the other hand at 6,185 deaths is now showing a dramatic reduction from a high of over 9,200 just a few years ago. Other countries also showing significant numbers of deaths include Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Ghana. The 42 country total of 35,394 deaths and the individual national totals are significant underestimates of the true totals.\nHowever, the overall picture that emerges is that fatality rates in most African countries \nlie in the range 50 to 150. This compares with most Latin American countries which are in the range 10 to 35 or Asian –Pacific countries which are in the range 8 to 37. Thus whilst some figures are of doubtful accuracy, it can be said that the highest fatality rates world-wide are to be found in Africa. \nVI. Work in small groups.

It is a single unit of speech.  You can \nrecognize a syllable by remembering that each one contains a vowel sound.  For \nexample, in the word  computer , there are three syllables: com /  pu  /  ter . The \nword  bike, however, has only one syllable. A single syllable may contain as little \nas just one sound, or as many as five:\nidea - ai / dia/ (two syllable)\ncough–/kaf/ (one syllable)\nYou can check how many  syllables  a word has by putting your hand under your \nchin and saying a word. Each time your chin moves to make a vowel sound, count \na syllable. \nFor example, the word  difficult  moves your chin three times. Therefore,  difficult  is \nthree syllables.\nNote : primary stress is marked by ( / ). Example difficult has three syllable. \nTherefore, the primary stress falls on three of them like /di/ffi/cult."

It has been practiced around the world for centuries. Agricultural and forest landscapes have been providing humans with food, fiber and energy as well as a range of other ecosystem services. \nThere are many benefits to practicing agroforestry, no matter its scale;  it can have \nlasting impacts on local and national economies, environments, and worldwide \nfood growth. Some of the benefits of agroforestry include: \nimproving soil quality, \nreintroducing nutrients into the soil, increased yields from crops, and increase in local biodiversity.\nAgroforestry is a system to manage the agricultural resource land for the benefits \nof the owner and the long-term welfare of society. While this is appropriate for \nall land, it is especially important in the case of hillside farming where agriculture may lead to rapid loss of soil. Normally land will be what the farmer owns (farmers that rent land may have little interest in the long-term benefits of agroforestry), and thus farmers must think conservatively about how to maintain the land over long periods of time.\nAgroforestry\n began to attract the attention of the international development \nand scientific community in the 1980s as a means for increasing and sustaining \nagricultural production in marginal lands and remote areas of the tropics that were \nnot benefited by the Green Revolution. Due to the research and development efforts \nat various local, regional, and global levels,  agroforestry  is at present recognized \nas having the potential to offer much toward sustainable land management and environmental  integrity in poor and rich nations alike. Discussing the role \nof agroforestry  in land management in the twenty-first century,  food security, \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation, and other ecosystem services are identified as the key areas where the impact of agroforestry could be noticeable in the immediate future."

What are the principles of community based resource management projects?\nNatural resource Management in Ethiopia\nEthiopia is a country which has suffered countless environmental disasters and biodiversity loss. To tackle these disasters and losses, environmental conservation efforts have been undergoing. Humbo carbon sequestration project, community \nmanagement of Afroalpine highlands, and Lake Tana watershed management are \namong the natural resource management efforts in the country.\nAfforestation and Reforestation project was introduced at Humbo Woreda of \nsouthwestern Ethiopia to regenerate 2,728 hectares of previously degraded \nforestland with the aim of enhancing the local communities’ livelihoods through \nimproved environmental conditions as well as financial inflows to be achieved through linkages with carbon markets. Since its inception, the initiative managed to restore 2,728 hectares of degraded forest by enclosing the land that had long been an open access resource. \nSimilarly, in the Central Highlands of Ethiopia, there is a small patch of land \nwhich has persisted in its current, relatively original state for the past four hundred \nyears. The area, called Guassa by the local Menzi people, ranges from 3200 to 3700 meters above sea level. It is part of the Amhara Regional State of North Shoa.The natural resource management system of the Guassa area dates back to the 17th Century. This makes it one of the oldest conservation areas in sub-Saharan Africa. \nThe area was set aside as a resource for the community, who use it for harvesting the “Guassa” grass for roofing, for grazing livestock, and for harvesting shrubs for fuel wood."

It is important in ecological  and economic \nterms, and it has both local and global significance. The watershed encompasses Lake Tana – the largest freshwater body in Ethiopia and source of the Blue Nile. Its unique and isolated landscape includes forested islands, immense and varied \nwetlands and high mountain areas. The region is renowned for its biodiversity, and it is also the home of churches and monasteries dating from the 14th to the 16th century. Ninety per cent of the area’s rapidly growing population depends on subsistence agriculture for their livelihoods. The productivity and sustainability of mixed farming  practices depend on ecosystem goods and services, which rely \non the functional integrity of the watershed’s ecosystems – rivers, wetlands, lake, \nforests, pastures and soils. The objectives of the watershed management project is to rehabilitate the land and to raise incomes for the community.\nTo conclude, all the three natural resource managements projects mentioned above \nare community- based.

Otherwise, the modifier is said to be dangling, and the sentence takes unintended meaning. \nFor example, look at this sentence:\nWhile sleeping in his backyard, a ball hit Belay on the head.\nThe unintended meaning is that the ball was sleeping in his backyard. What the \nwriter meant, of course, was that Belay was sleeping in his backyard. The writer \nshould have placed Belay right after the modifies, revising the rest of the sentence as necessary:\nWhile sleeping in his backyard, Belay was hit on the head by a ball.\nThe sentence could also be corrected by adding the missing subject and verb to the opening word group:\nWhile Belay was sleeping in his backyard,a ball hit him on the head.   \n4F.2 Expository Essay Writing\nThe expository essay is the genre of essay that requires the student to investigate an idea, evaluate evidence, expound on the idea, and make a statement concerning \nthat idea in a clear and concise manner. Generally,  expository essays  do not require \na great deal of outside research, but they do require that a student has background knowledge of a topic.\nEven though expository essays are meant to inform, they can serve different \npurposes depending on the writer’s objective. Here are the four different kinds of expository essays.\n•\tCause and Effect : The writer details the reasons for an event or situation before \ndiscussing the effect(s). These essays are common in literary essays or social studies reports.\n•\tProblem and Solution : After identifying a problem in today’s world, the \nwriter poses a possible solution. The problem/solution essay is similar to the cause/effect essay. It can become an argumentative essay depending on the writer’s tone."

You pick up a newspaper and you will find at least one or two news about road accidents daily. They cause loss of life as well as material. People need to be more careful when on the road, no matter which mode of transport you are from. Even the ones on foot are not safe because of the rise in these incidences. Every day people witness accidents in the news, \nfrom relatives and even with their own eyes.\n(B) Road accidents have become very common nowadays. As more people are \nbuying automobiles, the incidences of road accidents are just increasing day by day. Furthermore, people have also become more careless now. Not many people follow the traffic rules. Especially in big cities, there are various modes of transports. Moreover, the roads are becoming narrower and the cities have become more populated.\n(C) After that, we got to know the whole story. A man was crossing the road when a truck hit him leaving him severely injured. The man was lying on the ground bleeding profusely and people were calling for an ambulance. We instantly called up the ambulance but time was running out. Therefore, an auto driver took the man in his auto and rushed to the hospital.\n(D) Once I was on my way back home from festive shopping when I witnessed a road accident. I was with my sister and it was around 6 o’ clock in the evening. In the middle of the road, we saw a crowd surrounding something. We weren’t quite sure what was happening as the first thought that came to our mind was that it was probably a quarrel between two men. However, when we reached the spot, we found out an accident had taken place.\n(E) That incident made me realize how precious our lives are. In addition, as to how we take it for granted. We must all be very careful when on road, on foot or by a car that does not matter. We can adopt measures that will prevent road accidents."

It is applicable at all stages of production. At pre-harvesting stage, it is needed for land preparation, crop establishment, weeding, fertilization, irrigation, crop protection and harvesting. At post-harvest and storage, it is applied for drying, grading, winnowing, cleaning and storage. At the processing and marketing stage it is needed for chopping, milling, grinding, pressing, packaging and transport."

The demanding market has made the farming operations \nvery tense. On the contrary, labor market situations, capacity to utilize machines, and availability of complementary technologies are not accessible for smallholders. The benefits of mechanization could be also sustained by the availability and use of other complementary inputs such as improved seeds, fertilizers and water resources.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in goal number twelve (SDG12) \nprovides a strong case for sustainable crop production escalation that will protect natural resources while producing food for the global growing population. In order to achieve this, there is need to sharply improve labor and land productivity in the smallholder farming sector. The smallholder farming sector produces up to 80% of the food in developing countries. This would not only require improved access to essential crop production inputs including quality seed, fertilizer and irrigation water, but also would necessitate increased access to machinery. \nAs smallholder agriculture becomes more commercial and modern, and \nagricultural value chains get more intricate, there is need to promote diverse types of mechanization along these value chains. Vast mechanization opportunities for small to medium scale farmers and other entrepreneurs lie in agro-processing, transport or other off-farm activities. In identifying farm operations that should be mechanized, priority ought to be given to tasks where labor productivity is low and/or where labor drudgery is high. \nAgricultural mechanization is highly capital intensive, compared to the usually \nmanual inputs\n, but is very essential to agricultural production. It has also \nconsequences on the efficiency of all other inputs used in crop productions including \nseeds, fertilizer, water, and time and labor. It can also have very detrimental effects on the environmental sustainability of farming. It is also much more complex \nand demanding in its application, requiring not only correct use, but also a service infrastructure for maintenance and repair. However, climate smart agriculture such as conservation agriculture, safe and efficient application of pesticides, precision application of fertilizers, soil compaction management, efficient harvesting, and natural resource conservation ensure sustainable and safe production."

When higher level agricultural education research and extension were established in Ethiopia in the early 1950’s, poultry production was one of the programs. Jimma Agricultural Technical School, Alemaya College of Agriculture and United State Operational Mission Agricultural were the first institutes dealt with poultry farming projects. Jimma, Alemaya, Debre Zeit and Shashemene were the first four experiment stations. At the beginning, the projects dealt with the appraisal of the country’s indigenous chicken varieties, utility \nand their productivity. Later, four breeds of exotic chickens, Rhode Island Red, Australorp, New Hampshire and White Leghorns, were imported from Kenya, Denmark and the United States to Jimma and Alemaya. Trials and experimental activities were done in the areas of poultry housing, feeding, brooding, management, and disease and parasite control\nThe experimental stations played key roles in the establishment phase of the \ncurrent modern poultry sector and [in] the national poultry extension. They served as sources of improved verities and fertile eggs along with reliable information about the best methods of housing, feeding, management and marketing of poultry. The activities of the experiment stations were further strengthened with the establishment of modern poultry farms\n. The modern poultry farms were involved \nin the distribution of exotic genotype to urban poultry producers. The Ministry of \nAgriculture established seven more multiplication  centers in different parts of the \ncountry to enhance the national poultry extension activities."

In spite of the resentment I may feel about his leaving me, this photo holds many \nloving memories as well. It is of my loving grandfather — the strong, wonderful man and the alcoholic — and it is the most precious thing I own. Although I would much rather have him here, I stay connected to him when I look at it.\n5. Looking at this picture of my grandfather, I feel how much I have lost. In it, \nmy grandfather is sitting upright in a worn plaid easy chair. It was “his” chair, and when he was at work, I’d curl up in it and smell his perfume. His hair is so dark that it blends into the background of the photo. His deep dark brown eyes look vague in this photo. Although the photo is faded around the face, I still can make out his strong jaw and the cleft in his chin. In the photo, my grandfather is wearing a clean white shirt that reveals his thick, muscular arms. Resting in the crook of his left arm is my father. Both of them are smiling. They were always like very good friends\nThe right order of the paragraphs              ________, ______, ______, ______, _______\nIII.

Traditional remedies of growth policies are failing in the face of these new challenges. This in turn is contributing to widening social and economic disparities both between and within countries.\nLabor productivity has increased twentyfold in the last 200 years. Today, with \never increasing unemployment rates mirroring this fact, labor is far from being in short supply. On the contrary, natural resource scarcity is putting our societies at risk and the environmental effects of global resource use, such as climate change, desertification, or food shortages are threatening the security of mankind as well as damaging the stability of the world’s economic and security systems. As a consequence, it is vital that increased resource productivity becomes the central operator of technological progress in the future, with motivations for those who are more productive with limited resources. This will stimulate economies in many ways, e.g. in terms of higher economic multiplier effects as well as with the creation of (mostly local) green jobs. “Green Growth” must be understood as a goal for national, regional and global policies. This goes beyond sheer technical progress and involves structural change and transition towards less capital and resource intensive activities, especially in the early industrialized and therefore highly resource consuming parts of the world. It will involve business as well as household engagement and requires new forms of public-private interaction. If growth is to be understood as a means to enhance human wellbeing, it should not only be environmentally sustainable but also socially and economically viable. Guided by enabling policies and a strong ethical framework, such a development can help to ensure that everyone on the planet has enough to eat, work and live in decent conditions, is embedded in social networks and enjoys a good quality of education, health and community networks\nThe concept of green growth assumes that economic growth and development can \ncontinue while associated negative impacts on the environment, including  climate \nchange, are reduced – or while the natural environment continues to \nprovide  ecosystem services."

Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing due to population growth, industrialization and the expansion of agricultural activities. Its climate is varied and complex, and this is a challenge to policymaking. There is evidence of climate change in Ethiopia over the past 50 years. Although there is significant uncertainty in climate prediction models, high levels of climate vulnerability are turning hazards into disasters. Droughts and floods have increased in frequency which, when combined with increased variability, have had a major negative impact on growth in agriculture. Additionally, agricultural livelihoods are extremely vulnerable to climate, so the climate change impact and cost to agriculture are potentially large. A hotter and drier scenario, with increased droughts, could reduce GDP by 10% by 2050. This would increase food insecurity and the vulnerability of communities, which will struggle to survive."

The Ethiopian \ngovernment has decided to respond in a way that not only seeks to mitigate and adapt to climate change, but also to use this as an opportunity to switch to a new development model that will be sustainable. To this end, the government has initiated the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy (FDRE, 2011). This aims to protect the country from the adverse effects of climate change and to build a green economy that will help realize Ethiopia’s ambition to reach middle-\nincome status before 2025. The term  green economy  is defined as a  sustainable \neconomy  and society with  zero carbon emissions  where all energy is derived \nfrom  renewable resources  which are naturally replenished. In contrast, a  ‘black \nenergy economy’  is based on carbon-intensive fossil fuels such as coal and oil.\nIn order to respond to the growing threat of climate change, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia crafted the Climate-Resilient Green Economy Strategy (CRGE) in 2011 and mainstreamed it into the second Growth and Transformation Plan (GTPII). The CRGE strategy consists of climate resilience (CR) and Green Economy (GE) components, with adaptation and mitigation programs prioritized within the strategy. The CR component, focused on climate change adaptation, outlines the strategy for achieving economic development sustainably, highlighting both the country’s prospects for growth and its vulnerability to climate risks and changes that require a coordinated and sustained effort by all parts of the Ethiopian society— the government, civil society, academia, and—most importantly—the public. \nEthiopia’s CRGE strategy identifies more than 60 initiatives to limit greenhouse \ngas emissions while still bringing economic development. The aim is for emissions in the year 2030 to be roughly the same as they were in 2011 when the strategy was published. This is less than half the level estimated under a conventional development path.The CRGE plan is based on four pillars that include agriculture that works for  improving  crop and livestock production practices for higher food \nsecurity and farmer income while reducing emissions; Forestry for protecting \nand re-establishing forests for their economic and ecosystem services, including as carbon stocks;  Power for  expanding electricity generation from renewable sources of energy for domestic and regional markets; and transport, industrial sector and buildings for leapfrogging to modern and energy-efficient technologies in transport, industrial sectors and buildings. (Leapfrogging means jumping ahead without going through a slow development process.)"

Working with a partner, read the short paragraph below carefully and \nunderline the five instances of faulty parallelism. Then, correct the instances of faulty parallelism.\n1Running is an exercise that can be good for you mentally, physically and also be helpful \nfor your emotions. 2A beginning runner should keep three things in mind: the warm-\nup session, the actual time that you are running, and the cool-down period. 3Never \nstart a run without first having warmed up through stretching exercises. 4Stretching \nreduces muscles stiffness, decreases the possibility of injury, and it’s a good method to gradually increase the heart rate. \n5During the run itself, move at a comfortable pace. \n6Your breathing should be steady and with depth.7 Finally, remember to cool down \nafter a run. 8And adequate cool-down period allows time for the body to relax and the \nnormalizing of the heart rate.\nTips\nA sentence is “parallel” when equivalent parts share a grammatical form. Faulty parallelism, then, occurs when a sentence uses a different structure in different parts. The most common error of this kind tends to involve using two different verb tenses in a single clause. \n1. Parallelism and Verb Tense\nFor example: Marc  picks  up the hammer and  hit the nail.\nHere, each verb in the sentence has a different  tense form  “picks” = simple present; \n“hit” = simple past tense). And mixing tenses like this is ungrammatical.\nTo ensure a parallel construction, we would need a single verb tense:\nPresent tense:  Marc  picks  up the hammer and  hits the nail.\nPast tense:  Marc  picked  up the hammer and  hit the nail.\nBoth are now grammatically correct. Not every case of faulty parallelism concerns verb tense, though. And in the rest of this post, we’ll look at other examples of faulty parallelism and how you could fix them.\n2. Faulty Parallelism: Infinitives and Gerunds\nAnother common error is mixing  infinitive verbs  (i.e., to + verb) and  gerunds  (i.e., \nverbs ending in “-ing” used as a noun) in a single sentence. For instance:\nIncorrect:  Marc likes  to make  and repairing  furniture.\nThis is wrong because “to make” is an infinitive verb, while “repairing” is a \ngerund. To correct this, we’d have to rephrase the sentence using one form:\nInfinitives:  Marc likes  to make  and to repair  furniture."

Having your work  proofread  is also a good idea.\n3. Faulty Parallelism: Nouns, Adverbs and Adjectives\nTry not to mix nouns, adverbs and adjectives in descriptions. For example, the \nfollowing combines a noun (“frustration”) with an adjective (“angry”).\nIncorrect:  When Marc makes a mistake, he feels  frustration  and angry.\nBoth terms follow grammatically from “feels,” so there’s no problem there. Ideally, though, we would use one form in both cases. For example:Nouns:\n When Marc makes a mistake, he feels  frustration  and anger.\nAdjectives:  When Marc makes a mistake, he feels  frustrated  and angry.\nThese are both correct now, since each sentence uses a parallel construction.\n4. Faulty Parallelism: Plural and Singular Nouns\nThough this is primarily a stylistic issue, some consider mixing plural and singular nouns a form of faulty parallelism, especially when giving examples:\nIncorrect:\n DIY requires tools, such as a  hammer  and screwdrivers.\nHere, the singular “hammer” is combined with the plural “screwdrivers.” And \nwhile we can understand what the sentence means, using the same noun form in both cases would ensure a parallel structure:\nIncorrect:\n DIY requires tools, such as  a hammer,  drills,  and screwdrivers.\nHere, for instance, the singular “hammer” is combined with the plurals “drills,” \nand “screwdrivers.” But it would be better to use the same form for all:\nCorrect:  DIY requires tools, such as  hammers,  drills,  and screwdrivers.\nHere, “faintness” is singular and “headaches” is plural. But “faintness” is an \nuncountable noun (i.e., it can’t be quantified). As such, we can use it with a plural noun and still have a parallel sentence structure.\n6F.2  Comparing two pie-charts.\n V  Activity 6.12\nModel Task\nThe two pie charts below show the online shopping sales for retail sectors in Canada in \n2005 and 2010."

A formal debate involves two sides: one supporting a resolution and one opposing it. A debate is bound by rules previously agreed upon. Debates are judged in order to declare a winning side. In the context of a classroom, the topic for debate will be guided by knowledge, language skill, and value outcomes.\nStructure for Debate:\nA formal debate usually involves three groups: one supporting a resolution \n(affirmative team), one opposing the resolution (opposing team), and those who are judging the quality of the evidence and arguments and the performance in the debate. The affirmative and opposing teams usually consist of three members each,"

In addition to the three specific groups, there may an audience made up of class members not involved in the formal debate. A specific resolution is developed and rules for the debate are established.Debate opens with the affirmative team (the team that supports the resolution) presenting their arguments, followed by a member of the opposing team. This pattern is repeated for the second speaker in each team. Finally, each team gets an opportunity for rebutting the arguments of the opponent. Speakers should speak slowly and clearly. The judges and members of the audience should be taking notes as the debate proceeds.While a team is not required to use all of the time allocated to each debate component, speakers must stop immediately when the allocated time runs out. The timekeeper will announces the end of time one minute earlier by knocking once or making any other sign previously agreed upon. After this last minute ends, the timekeeper stops the speaker immediately. Team members are prohibited from speaking to the audience or opposing team except at the times specifically allocated to them.The order of the speeches:"

Owning such advancements, countries have taken advantage in warfare, boosted their economies and brought wealth to their people. \nThe Roman roads are perhaps the Roman Empire’s greatest legacy crucial for its \nmassive expansion and a way to keep control over the gigantic empire. The road system covered large parts of today’s Europe, Turkey and the northern parts of Africa. Construction began in 300 BC and the roads served several purposes. They facilitated fast movement of the armies and trade goods, as well as civilians. But they also served as a way to mark the borders of the Roman Empire, to claim new territories and maintain them. The whole system comprised more than 400,000 kilometers of roads at the peak of the Roman Empire. No fewer than 29 great military highways radiated from the capital, giving birth to the saying “All roads lead to Rome.”\nThe Suez Canal in Egypt is a waterway that connects the Mediterranean Sea to \nthe Red Sea. It is one of the world’s most heavily used shipping lanes. It was constructed in between 1859 and 1869. It provides the shortest maritime  route \nbetween Europe and the lands lying around the Indian and western Pacific oceans. The 193-kilometer-long route is therefore a direct link between Eastern and Western civilizations, shortening the distance from Europe to Asia by more than 8,000 kilometers. Apart from boosting Egypt’s economy, the canal is crucial in international trade routes.\nInterstate Highway System  was the American biggest project. President Dwight D. \nEisenhower not only wanted the United States to be ready to respond to military conflict, but also to improve shipping and transportation across the entire country. The construction began in 1956 finished in 1992. Possibly it was the most valuable improvement to the country’s infrastructure and costliest projects in the world. The total length of the system of roadways is 77,556 kilometers, roughly enough to wrap the Earth, twice."

The projects are believed to bring not only economic development but freedom to the people. \nEthiopia embarked upon the construction of the Great Ethiopian Renascence \nDam (GERD) on the Blue Nile in 2011 at a cost of 4.8 USD. The dam is expected to annually generate around 6540 MW of energy. The GERD will be the largest hydroelectric power generation facility in Africa and the fifth largest \nin the world.  The hydroelectric project will significantly improve livelihoods in \nthe region more broadly  and address widespread poverty and improve the living \nstandards of  Ethiopian.  The project is nearing completion despite an active dispute \nwith Egypt which is opposed to the project.\nEthiopia, whose highlands supply more than 85 percent of the water that flows into \nthe Nile River, has hardly been using the water. Conversely, Nile River has brought prosperity to the civilization of Egypt for 5,000 years. The complex irrigation systems have helped the Egyptians to make a better use of the water, with the first evidence of water control from as early as 3,100 BC. The Egyptians took advantage of the natural cyclical flooding pattern of the Nile River. The flooding happens fairly predictably, they were able to develop their agricultural practices around it.\nKenya-Uganda-Rwanda-South Sudan Railway project  is East Africa’s mega joint railway \nproject. It is estimated to cost USD 9.8 billion. So far only Kenya has completed the initial phase of the project from Mombasa to Nairobi. The planned 1,500km-long \nrailway  line is aimed at enhancing connectivity in the region and spurs economic \ngrowth.

The young boy sees me, or rather he sees the car first — a silver BMW — and quickly springs up from his spot under a small tree, eager to sell his bunches of bananas and bottles of roasted peanuts. His dingy shirt hangs low over too-short shorts. His sucked-in cheeks and wrinkled lips suggest that although he appears to be about twelve, he already knows the sourness of life. By the time I stop the car, he is at the passenger door, grunting: “Banana 300 naira (roughly $2). Groundnut 200 naira. Sah!” I look skeptically at his black-striped bananas and bargain him down to 200 total for the fruit and nuts. When he agrees, I reach for my wallet and hand him a crisp 500 naira note. He doesn’t have change, so I tell him not to worry. He is grateful and smiles a row of perfect teeth. \n2. Two weeks into my stay, on a rare occasion when my mother has time to chat, \nI tell her that I’m bored. Her response: “Here are the car keys. Go and buy some fruit.” Overjoyed, I jump into the car, salute the heavily armed security at the gate and speed off in search of — fruit. \n3. I pull over and wind down my window. He wears the same shirt and shorts and \nhas a bunch of bananas and a bottle of peanuts ready. I wave them away. “What’s up?” I ask him. He answers in broken English: “I dey oh. But I no get money to buy book for school.” I reach into my wallet and pull out two fresh 500 naira notes. “Will this help?” I ask. He looks around nervously before sticking his hand into the car to take the bills. One thousand naira is a lot of money to someone whose family probably makes about 50,000 naira ($380) or less each year. “Thank you, sah,” he says. “Thank you very much, oh!”"

It has already raised high hopes among policy-makers with regard to its potential for delivering solutions forgrowing capacity problems. For integrated care, today’s segregatedtelemedicine \napplications still require linking into more comprehensive electronic Health  \n(eHealth) strategies, in which clinical  pathways and service delivery processes are \nfully coordinated andpatient data safely shared. \nTelemedicine is part of a larger digital transformation in health care. The electronic \nhealth record, omnipresent mobile devices and faster internet connections have \nprovided new ways for patients and providers to interact. As a result, hospitals and \nhealth systems need a strategy for their own digital transformation. Telemedicine connects patients to vital health care services through videoconferencing, remote monitoring, electronic consults and wireless communications. By increasing access to physicians and specialist, telemedicine helps ensure patients receive the right care, at the right place, at the right time.\nIntegrating telemedicine into Electronic Health Record (EHR) system helps \nproviders improve clinical workflows. Most telemedicine providers now design solutions that integrate into common EHR systems, which enhances patient care and increases interoperability. When platforms are intertwined, EHR systems and \ntelemedicine solutions can streamline patient care in one single workflow. The \nideal telemedicine experience should be similar to a virtual visit in the office.With an integrated telemedicine solution, it is easy for the front office to get the patient checked in and for the nurse to interact with a patient who utilizes telemedicine integrated solution.\nBoth providers and patients benefit significantly from Electronic Health Record \ntelemedicine integration. Integrating a telemedicine platform into the EHR and patient portal reduces clinician burden and eases documentation. And when patients have easy access to telemedicine, it can reduce travel for patients and enhance patient flexibility. It opens up a great opportunity to be more consumer centric, to understand the kind of inconvenience and difficulty that even coming to the clinic sometimes brings to families. An integration solution does not require multiple clicks to bounce between documentation and video screens."

The few medical specialists who are available work mainly in the capital city and in a few regional cities.More than 80% of the Ethiopian population live in rural areas. The scattered settlements of the Ethiopian people and the inaccessibility of some of these settlements has made healthcare challenging and healthcare inequality is thus common place.

According to WHO (2014), the physician to population density of Ethiopia is 0.025/1000 which makes the country one of the countries with the lowest physician to population ratio in the world. Most medical doctors are attached to hospitals in the larger cities. Thus in rural areas, people do not have the same access to healthcare as city dwellers.\nThe government of Ethiopia has implemented several programs to support the \nhealthcare system in rural communities. For instance, with the intention of building \nthe capacity of healthcare workers and strengthening the national health systems in \nresource constrained localities, some telemedicine projects have been implemented \nin several parts of the country.\nTelemedicine was originally started in Ethiopia by the National Telemedicine \nCoordinating Committee (NTCC) formed as a joint enterprise of the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH), Medical Faculty of Addis Ababa University, and the Ethiopian Telecommunication Authority (ETA). Following this initiative, three more projects were established by different organizations to support the healthcare system. The organizations include the International Telecom Union (ITU), the Pan-African Initiative (Ethio-Indian Telemedicine Project), Johns Hopkins University (Tsehay Project), and I-Tech Ethiopia (Swinfen Charitable Trust project). The goal of these programs is to reach the underserved communities by efficiently utilizing the medical and public health professionals that are concentrated in the larger cities.\nThe first telemedicine project in Ethiopia was established by the International \nTelecom Union (ITU) in 2003. The project was aimed at ensuring access to affordable and clinically acceptable primary healthcare for underserved rural \ncommunities. It had a host at Black Lion Referral Hospital to provide tele-radiology, \ntele-dermatology, and tele-consultation services for healthcare workers, basically medical doctors, public health workers and medical students.\nThe second telemedicine project in Ethiopia was initiated by the Pan-African \ne-Network. This project interconnects selected telemedicine sites in Africa with the main telemedicine service provider in India. With the help of the African Union,"

Since Ethiopia has been \nthe seat of the African Union and fulfilled the selection criteria, ten public hospitals were selected to connect to the main telemedicine service provider in India. In Ethiopia, most experienced medical specialists are found in the TikurAnbessa (Black Lion) hospital in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. As a result of this, the telemedicine center in this hospital is connected to other telemedicine centers outside Addis Ababa and delivers tele-radiology and tele-dermatology services to, for instance, Gondar, Jimma and Nekemte hospitals. This telemedicine center also interconnects other hospitals in Addis Ababa such as Alert, St. Paul, and Zewditu hospitals. Physicians at Jimma hospital use the Internet to communicate and consult with specialists in Wolisso and MetuHospitals in Oromia region.\nIn 2006, Johns Hopkins University started a telemedicine project that focused on \nHIV/AIDS prevention, its treatment and the rehabilitation of these patients. Its center is in the United States of America (USA) and it serves two locations in Ethiopia namely, Black Lion Referral Hospital located in Addis Ababa and Hawassa Hospital located in Sidama Regional state (Hawassa town). This telemedicine service uses real-time telemedicine through videoconferencing. It provides medical and consultation services for medical professionals, medical students, and patients. The program is known as Technical Support for the Ethiopian HIV/AIDS ART Initiatives (TSEHAI).\nCurrently, the Swinfen Charitable Trust—established in 1998 to support developing \ncountries by giving them access to medical specialists via telemedicine—has telemedicine links with Seven Ethiopian hospitals. I-TECH is an international network that has enabled Kenya, India, Ukraine and Namibia to collaborate with Ethiopia to build capacity in healthcare and to strengthen the national health systems in resource constrained localities. Currently, Mekele University is utilizing this technology as well and I-TECH has continued its additional telemedicine site \nconstruction at the medical school of Bahir Dar University. \nAlthough healthcare inequality has been a persistent problem globally, the \ncase is worse in developing countries where people suffer from communicable diseases. In order to support the healthcare systems, different mechanisms such as telemedicine, have been used. Telemedicine has great potential to improve health care in Ethiopia as medical expertise is urgently needed."

            "text": "ENGLISH STUDENT  TEXTBOOK GRADE 12            UNIT   8 Telemedicine\n205Tips on Active and Passive Voice\nWhat’s the difference?\nUnderstanding the difference between active and passive voice allows you to control \nyour writing style.   Both styles have their appropriate uses.   Consider the active sentence, \n“I love you”, versus the passive “You are loved by me”.   Which is stronger?   Which \none would you rather hear? Some students think that using the passive voice makes \nthem sound more academic, but (as in the above example) when it is misused, it just sounds wordy.\n   On the other hand, sometimes the passive voice is more appropriate. \nImagine that you are writing an article about cotton.   Is it better to write “People \nhave used cotton for thousands of years” or “Cotton has been used for thousands of years”?\n  In this situation, the passive construction is better because the writer’s topic \nremains in the foreground of the sentence and the subject (people) is implied, so it doesn’t need to be included in the sentence.\n  \nGenerally, the active voice conveys meaning more clearly, concisely, and interestingly, and a writer, when faced with the choice, should favor the active voice over the passive voice.\n  However, there are four writing situations in which the passive voice is more \nappropriate:\n1) When the subject is unimportant.\nIn scientific papers, for example, a writer might use passive voice to highlight the results of the study or experiment rather than him/herself.\n \nE.g. The blood sample was tested for infectious diseases and labeled accord -\ningly;\n(However, scientific writing guides increasingly recommend the use of active voice, even if it necessitates the use of first person pronouns.\n  Check with your teacher).\nIn a more general context, as a stylistic choice, the passive voice may be appropriate.   For \nexample, in an article about Joe Biden you would structure sentences to keep him in the foreground, requiring (perhaps) the occasional use of the passive voice:\n e.g. Joe Biden was elected by the American people in November, 2020."

            "text": "UNIT     8 Telemedicine\nENGLISH STUDENT  TEXTBOOK  GRADE 12206However, if your paper was not about Biden but about, say, the voting patterns of \nAmericans, you would keep the sentence in the active voice:\n       e.g. The American people elected Joe Biden in November, 2020.\n2) When the subject is unknown.\ne.g.  An Ethiopian woman was murdered late last night.   Police say there are \nno suspects.                \n3) When you want to downplay the importance of the subject.  \n(This strategy is much loved by politicians because it allows them to admit mistakes without naming those responsible).\ne.g.  Inaccurate information about the presence of Weapons of Mass Destruction \nwas relayed.\nOr   The plaintiff was shot in the face while hunting (not Alex shot the plaintiff in \nthe face while hunting!)\n4) When there are two verbs with the same subject, make the second verb passive.\ne.g. Alex shot someone in the face, and was awarded a slap on the wrist.\n Although the active voice is usually better, the passive voice has its place too.   After \nyou have written your rough draft, and after you have revised the content of your work, you should assess your use of active or passive voice as a part of the proofreading process.\n  If you find you are overusing the passive voice, it is very \neasy to change.   First, figure out who or what is the subject, and then let the subject \nperform the verb.\n8E.2 Verbs and Prepositions\n V  Activity 8.13\nI.

In pairs, re-arrange the following jumbled paragraphs into a complete \nargumentative essay  \n1. Second, it is incredibly narrow-minded to assume that the only service libraries \noffer is book lending. Libraries have a multitude of benefits, and many are only available if the library has a physical location. Some of these benefits include acting as a quiet study space, giving people a way to converse with their neighbors, holding classes on a variety of topics, providing jobs, answering patron questions, and keeping the community connected. One neighborhood found that, after a \nlocal library instituted community events such as play times for toddlers and \nparents, job fairs for teenagers, and meeting spaces for senior citizens, over a third of residents reported feeling more connected to their community. Similarly, a Pew survey conducted in 2015 found that nearly two-thirds of American adults feel that closing their local library would have a major impact on their community. People see libraries as a way to connect with others and get their questions answered, benefits tablets can’t offer nearly as well or as easily\n.\n2. While replacing libraries with tablets may seem like a simple solution, it would encourage people to spend even more time looking at digital screens, despite the myriad issues surrounding them. It would also end access to many of the benefits of libraries that people have come to rely on. In many areas, libraries are such an important part of the community network that they could never be replaced by a simple object.\n3. As online learning becomes more common and more and more resources are converted to digital form, some people have suggested that public libraries should be shut down and, in their place, everyone should be given an tablets  with an e-reader subscription\n4. However, it would be a serious mistake to replace libraries with tablets. First, digital books and resources are associated with less learning and more problems than print resources. A study done on tablet vs book reading found that people"

Additionally, staring too long at a screen has been shown to cause numerous health problems, including blurred vision, dizziness, dry eyes, headaches, and eye strain, at much higher instances than reading print does. People who use tablets and mobile devices excessively also have a higher incidence of more serious health issues such as fibromyalgia, shoulder and back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and muscle strain. I know that whenever I read from my e-reader for too long, my eyes begin to feel tired and my neck hurts. We should not add to these problems by giving people, especially young people, more reasons to look at screens.\n5. Proponents of this idea state that it will save local cities and towns money because libraries are expensive to maintain. They also believe it will encourage more people to read because they won’t have to travel to a library to get a book; they can simply click on what they want to read and read it from wherever they are. They could also access more materials because libraries won’t have to buy physical copies of books; they can simply rent out as many digital copies as they need.\nThe right order is _______, _________, _________, _________, and __________.\nTips on writing argumentative essay\nWhat Is an Argumentative Essay?\nAn argumentative essay is an essay that uses evidence and facts to support the \nclaim it’s making. Its purpose is to persuade the reader to agree with the argument \nbeing made.\nA good argumentative essay will use facts and evidence to support the argument, \nrather than just the author’s thoughts and opinions . \nTips for Writing a Good Argumentative Essay\nA.  Make Your Thesis Crystal Clear\nThe thesis is the key to your argumentative essay; if it isn’t clear or readers can’t find it easily, your entire essay will be weak as a result. Always make sure that your thesis"

The typical spot for it is the final sentence of the introduction \nparagraph, but if it doesn’t fit in that spot for your essay,  try to at least put it as the first \nor last sentence of a different paragraph so it stands out more.\nAlso make sure that your thesis makes clear what side of the argument you’re on. \nAfter you’ve written it, it’s a great idea to show your thesis to a couple different people--classmates are great for this. Just by reading your thesis they should be able to understand what point you’ll be trying to make with the rest of your essay.\nB.    Show Why the Other Side Is Weak\nWhen writing your essay, you may be tempted to ignore the other side of the argument and just focus on your side, but don’t do this. The best argumentative essays really tear apart the other side to show why readers shouldn’t believe it. Before you begin writing your essay, research what the other side believes, and what their strongest points are. Then, in your essay, be sure to mention each of these and use evidence to explain why they’re incorrect/weak arguments. That’ll make your essay much more effective than if you only focused on your side of the argument.\nC. Use Evidence to Support Your Side\nRemember, an essay can’t be an argumentative essay if it doesn’t support its argument with evidence. For every point you make, make sure you have facts to \nback it up.  Some examples are previous studies done on the topic, surveys of \nlarge groups of people, data points, etc.  There should be lots of numbers in your \nargumentative essay that support your side of the argument. This will make your essay much stronger compared to only relying on your own opinions to support your argument.\nII. Now, choose one of the following topics and write an argumentative essay by arguing for or against the topic.\n1. Health facilities in Ethiopia are equitably distributed.\n2. Telemedicine should not be practiced in Ethiopia.\n3. Herbal medicine should be given priority than modern medicine in Ethiopia.\n4. Our government should provide health care for free."

Who are the stakeholders who can help teens to develop endurance against \npressures?                 \nModels for managing conflict in a family\n1. When a teen and a parent argue, it does not mean that something is wrong with their relationship. It means that they have different understanding, interest, values, attitudes or beliefs. Conflict is never easy, but it is more prevalent in households where there are teenagers attempting to establish individualism and parents become \nreluctant to accept the changes.\n2. Where there are an adolescent and a parental figure in a home, any topic can trigger \na conflict. Topics that cause the greatest stress in a family include household rules and responsibilities. According to Carl Pickhar, certain processes must occur for the child to reach healthy emotional adulthood. The child identifies separation, differentiation and opposition as necessary processes."

In the separation process, the teen wants distance from parents and family to gain \nindividuality in the social world and to establish privacy. Because of the desire to separate, the teen communicates less with the parents, and this concerns them. \nIn the period of differentiation, the teen begins to experiment with self-images to distinguish who he wants to become. Hair, clothing styles and individual image are important to the teen. Often, the parents do not agree with some of the choices, which is natural. Opposition is the process of challenging parental authority. Parents and the child disagree about what is acceptable, fair, good or bad. Disagreement can become a way of life in the family. Often conflict between teens and parents turns into a battle of wills. Both parties strive to win each argument, and winning rather than communication becomes their objective. \n4. In both parties engaged in a conflict, blame is a destructive entity. Understanding what someone is saying is the necessary focus, not who is at fault. Yelling tends to shift the emphasis onto who can be louder, not the essence of the conversation. A teenager wants acknowledgment rather than a blame from a parent. The teen expects the parents to know that this transforming individual can act like an adult and make good decisions. The recognition of maturity and value as a person is also high on a teenager’s list. \n5. Once a conflict is felt in the family, parents are advised to use knowledge based problem-solving techniques or models. John Dewey, educational psychologist, suggests the following steps in his model that can be used to solve conflicts. \n6. The first step in this model is to define the conflict. This is the most essential step in the entire process of managing conflict. Parents should define the obvious content issues as well as the underlying relational issues. \n7. The next step in Dewey’s model is to define the problem in specific terms. Conflict defined in abstract terms is difficult to deal with and resolve. Instead, define the conflict by identifying specific behaviors. You can agree on and deal with these behaviors. Throughout this definitive process, try to understand the conflict’s nature from the other person’s point of view. Exercise your perspective-taking skills. You should also avoid attempting to read the other person’s mind. Ask directly and simply to make sure you see the problem from the other person’s point of view. \n8. Whenever you think you understand the problem as seen by the other person, check your perception again. Then, confirm the other person’s definition of the problem. Let the other person know that you understand how she or he thinks and"

Watch assuming that the other person will be able to tell \nwhether or not you understand. \n9. Step three is to examine the possible solution. After understanding the other person’s view, examine possible solutions. Most conflicts probably can be resolved through a variety of solutions. At this stage,  try to identify as many solutions as \npossible. Look for solutions that will enable both parties to win – to get something each wants. Avoid win-lose solutions. These solutions, in which one wins, and one loses will cause frustration and resentment for the children. \n10. Step four is to test the possible solutions. Once you have examined all possible solutions, select one and test it out. Test the solution mentally. Test the solution by putting it into operation. Give each solution a fair chance, but don’t hang on to one when it is clear that it won’t resolve the conflict.\n11. In general, schools, society and peers must collaborate to help a teenager to endure the pressure. The way that the teen chooses to handle the burdens of upcoming adulthood can determine his/her future path. An observant and guiding parent can \nhelp along the way. \nAdapted from Sandi Hoffman, (2010)\nV. The topic sentence is taken from the reading passage.

This age group according to child growth and development chart are the early and middle-late stages of adolescent life. These stages are Early (12-14 years), Middle (15-17 years), and Late (18-20 years). Adolescence or puberty is a biological event, an episode in our life when we as a growing child experienced changes in physical appearance, psychological orientation, and sociological construct similar to that of a young adult. For instance, changes in the way we perceive ourselves, the way we think, acquire knowledge, solve problems, etc., the way we value our autonomy and identity, and the way we see the opposite sex."

Most of us during this stage were already capable of acquiring the information we need, solve problems on our own, deal with almost any situation, and contemplate our ability to succeed\nLater in the middle stage, most of us were already sociable and able to accept different \npoints of views. We also spent more time with friends and extracurricular activities than with our family. Moreover, those were the days when we start taking our studies seriously, improved our social skills further, decide on our own, and became more conscious with our personality. Finally, it was the first that we became concern about our future and the career that we cherished today.\nThe years we had in high school are special and indeed memorable. It was when we \nfirst experienced adulthood, learned to value others, saw the need to think, decide, and solve problems on our own. It was during those happy years that we start developing our self-esteem, attempt self-sufficiency, and care for the opposite sex. \nWe were novices, we know so little about the world but it was fun. We jumped for \njoy whenever solved our math problems. Smile when learned something of value. We were in bliss whenever we worked hard and passed the test. We laughed at almost anything including our own mistake and stupidity. \nThe valuable academic skills and competencies provided by our high school teachers \nhelped us reached our goals and become productive members of our society today. We must never forget that. Moreover, the good thing about high school memories is not about the hilarious experiences we had but the embarrassment in class that taught us to focus more on our studies and endeavors in later life.\nII.

Review information about the company and position\nIt’s best to write a new application letter for each position you’re applying for so \nyou can include pertinent details and show your interest in the particular open role. \nSpend some time reviewing the company information, which you can likely find on the website, as well as the position listing. Compare your qualifications and experi -\nence with the list of skills in that posting. You may also want to think about specific \nexperiences that have prepared you for the role, such as leading a team or managing a major event.\n2. Open the letter by describing your interest\nIn the first paragraph of your letter, mention the job title for which you’re applying and where you saw the position posting. Include your specific interest in the role \nand company. Briefly state the main experience or qualification you have that makes \nyou a good fit. \nExample:  “I saw the vacancy announcement for the marketing role on job board, \nand I am very interested. I’m drawn to your company’ s mission of innovation and \nputting the customer first. I am in my final year of earning my bachelor’s  degree in \nmarketing with a minor in communications, so I feel my educational experience has \nprepared me to work in a fast-paced marketing department like the one within your \norganization.”  \n3. Outline your experience and qualifications\nThe next few paragraphs of your letter should highlight your experience, qualifi -\ncations and skills, positioned in a way that aligns with the company’s goals and \nmission. Since a job application letter should stand on its own without a resume, it’s helpful to include details about your experience that relate to the position to which you’re applying.\n4. Include aspects of your personality\nAs you’re writing your job application letter, consider how you can incorporate aspects of your personality while remaining professional. A friendly and engag -\ning letter is likely to appeal to the reader, especially when they can get an idea of how well you might fit with the team.\n5. Express appreciation\nBefore you sign off on your letter, express your appreciation to the hiring manag -\ner for reviewing your letter and considering you for the position. The hiring man -\nager is taking time out of their day to read what you have written, so expressing your gratitude for that time spent is a polite and professional way to close the document."

Robots need to manipulate objects; pick up, modify, destroy, or otherwise have an effect. Thus the functional end of a robot arm intended to make the effect \n(whether a hand, or tool) are often referred to as  end effectors , while the “arm” is \nreferred to as a  manipulato r.  Most robot arms have replaceable end-effectors, each \nallowing them to perform some small range of tasks. Some have a fixed manipulator that cannot be replaced, while a few have one very general purpose manipulator, for example, a humanoid hand. \nThere are a large number of applications for manipulation. Picking up an object \nfrom one bin and placing it into another bin  one version of the famous “pick and place” problem is a great application for robotic manipulation. Robots have done this for decades in factories with carefully curated parts. In the last few years, we have seen a new generation of pick-and-place systems that use deep learning for perception, and can work well with much more diverse sets of objects, especially if the location/orientation of the placement need not be very accurate. This can be done with conventional robot hands or more special-purpose end-effectors that, for instance, use suction. It can often be done without having a very accurate understanding of the shape, pose, mass, nor friction of the object(s) to be picked."

Pick and place robots for electronic components \nand for large objects like car windscreens, often use very simple vacuum end-effectors.\nWhile advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have made better \nrobotics possible, there is still quite a wide gap between what humans and robots can do. Closing that gap will require overcoming a number of obstacles in robot manipulation, or the ability of robots to manipulate environments and adapt to changing stimuli.\nIn robot manipulation, learning is a promising alternative to traditional engineering \nmethods and has demonstrated great success, especially in pick-and-place tasks. Although many research questions still need to be answered, learned robot manipulation could potentially bring robot manipulators into our homes and businesses.

However, only half can afford the required healthcare services. This is especially critical when a person’s quality of life diminishes and their independence is reduced. In this context, technological advances can play an important role, since they may enable people with disabilities to receive the healthcare necessary to lead a fulfilling life and be independent.\nCurrently, enormous variety of assistive technology are available. Given the wide \nranges of types and levels of deficiency, assistive technology can be classified depending on its complexity. Three concentric spheres of assistive technology can be defined with the user at their center. These are embodied assistive technology, assistive environments, and assistive robots.\nRobotic suit or exoskeleton is a type of embodied assistive technology that assists \nmobility. \nA man who is paralyzed from below his shoulders has been able to walk \nusing a robotic suit.
