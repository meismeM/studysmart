Erosion by water and wind (external processes) can erode land and create minor landforms like gullies, river valleys ,and gorges. Both processes happen over a long period  , sometimes millions of years. For example, it took a very long period to cut the deep Abbay  Gorge  between the towns of Goha Tsiyon in North Shewa, Oromia, and Dejen in East Gojam, Amhara National Regional State.

These oceans are the Arctic  Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific\nOcean, and the Southern Ocean. The oceans together cover huge areas of the Earth. They cover seventy one percent of the Earth. The Pacific Ocean is both the largest and the deepest ocean, which covers one-third of the Earth’s surface. \nOceans are important factors for creating or forming coastal land features such as \nislands, peninsulas, isthmuses.

These landforms generally divide continents and countries into different physiographic divisions. Let us find out important physiographic regions formed by these landforms in the world. \nI. Mountain\nMountains are the largest elevated and most recognizable landforms on the Earth’s surface. They have steep sides, and high peaks, that stand out from the surrounding land. Around mountains, we may find smaller, less steep landforms called hills. \nMountains are usually formed when rock layers are pushed together from opposite sides. Thus, the pressure exerted from the movement forces the land in the middle to rise. The low areas between mountains are called valleys. Mountains may also be"

It is part of the Himalaya Mountain range that runs across several countries \nin South and Southeast Asia such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Afghanistan. The mountain range extends 320 to 400 kms in width and 1500 kms in length. The Himalayas were formed about 40 to 50 million years ago when the Indian tectonic plates collided with the Eurasian plate. Indian tectonic plate and the Eurasian plates are continental crust and have the same density.

These processes form \nmajor landforms of the world as mentioned in the section 1.1 above.  Similarly, in Africa there are several recognizable major landforms. Understanding landforms is very important because as part of a landscape, landforms greatly affect human perception and interactions with the environment. Landforms provide a physical context for describing the landscape, topography, and ecological units within the environment.  Understanding the physical and historical context of the landscape is necessary in order to understand the temporal and spatial scales of ecosystems. Landforms are ecologically important elements because ecosystems (which consists \nof all the organisms and the physical environment with which they interact) develop within landform regions, and material and energy flows occur within the landform system.  Landforms also affect, modify, and influence climate. The effect can be recognized in both large areas as macroclimate  and small areas as microclimate .\nEffects of landforms on ecosystem patterns and processes include:\n1 Landform attributes (elevation, steepness of slope, and aspect) produce many different \npatterns which determine the ecological potential of an area.\n2 Landform regions affect the flow of organisms, energy ,and material.\n3 Landform regions affect the spatial pattern of non-geomorphic disturbance by fire and \nwind.\n4 Landforms may resist changes that geomorphic processes create; hence they protect biotic \nfeatures and processes.\nIn Africa , there are four significant landform regions. Each of these regions contains eight major physical regions: the Atlas Mountains, the Sahara, the Sahel, the savanna, the rainforest, the Rift Valley and African Great Lakes, the Ethiopian Highlands, mountains and desert systems of South Africa.

The open spacing lets a dense lower layer where grasses \ndevelop. The woodland has an open, park-like appearance. \nIn the tropical savanna woodland of Africa, the trees are of medium height. Tree \ncrowns are flattened or umbrella-shaped, and the trunks have thick, rough bark. Some species of trees are xerophytic forms – adapted to the dry environment with \nsmall leaves and thorns.

Knowing a region’s climate classification can be useful when choosing building materials for protection and durability, or when considering what crops are likely to thrive in a region. For tourists, knowing a location’s climate classification can help them select and pack appropriate clothing.\nThere are various classification schemes used by climatologists for categorizing \nworld’s climate into different regions.

Long-term records of temperature and precipitation reveal climate patterns across continents, delineating them into climate regions. Class names for classification systems based on weather patterns often include geographical names such as polar, tropical, continental, and marine. These terms are modified by terms describing temperature and moisture, or the intensity of weather during summer or winter.  The descriptors that are used in this method of classification include moist or dry, warm or cold, and temperate or severe.\nToday, climate scientists split the earth into approximately five major types: tropical, \ndry, temperate, continental, and polar considering a variety of factors including \naltitude, air pressure, wind patterns, latitude and geographical characteristics such as mountains and oceans. \nOne of the most widely used classification schemes is made by the German \nClimatologist and Botanist Wladimir Köppen (1846-1940). He divided the world’s climates into categories based upon general temperature profiles related to latitude. The Köppen classification uses easily obtained data: mean monthly and annual values of temperature and precipitation."

What other classification \nschemes do you know?\nClimate zones are areas with distinct climates, which occur in the east-west direction \naround the Earth, and they can be classified using different climatic parameters. Generally, climate zones are belt-shaped and circular around the poles (see Figure 2.3). In some areas, climate zones can be interrupted by mountains or oceans. The world’s climate pattern reflects a regular and dependable operation of the major climate controls.\nThe solar radiation reaches the ground on different parts of the Earth at different \nangles. On the equator, the sunlight reaches the ground almost perpendicularly, whilst at the poles the angle of the Sun is lower or even under the horizon during the polar night.\nThroughout the seasons, the position of the Sun to the Earth changes and thus the \nangle of incidence of the sunlight also changes. The angle of the Sun at noon varies from perpendicular (90°) within the tropics up to horizontal (0° = Sun does not or only partially appear on the horizon) within the polar circle. Thus, the sunlight warms up the Earth around the equator much more strongly than at the poles. Due to temperature differences caused by the differences in radiation, recurring climatic conditions develop.\nThere are four major global climate zones:\n1.Tropical Zone from 0°– 231/2° (between the tropics) - In the regions between \nthe equator and the tropics (equatorial region), the solar radiation reaches the \nground nearly vertically at noontime during almost the entire year. Thereby, it is very warm in these regions. Through high temperatures, more water evaporates and the air is often moist. The resulting frequent and dense cloud cover reduces the effect of solar radiation on the ground temperature."

These regions receive less moisture (see trade winds), which increases the effect of radiation. Therefore, most of the deserts in the world are situated in this zone. In winter, the radiation in these regions decreases significantly, and it can temporarily be very cool and moist.\n3.Temperate Zone from 40°– 60° - In the temperate zone, the solar radiation arrives at a lower angle, and the average temperatures here are much cooler than in the subtropics. The seasons and day length differ significantly in the course of a year. The climate is characterized by less frequent extremes, more regular distribution of the precipitation over the year and a longer vegetation period – therefore, it is named as “temperate”.\n4.Cold Zone from 60°– 90° - The polar areas between 60° latitude and the poles receive less heat through solar radiation, since there is very low angle of the Sun. Because of the changes of the Earth axis angle to the Sun, the day length varies most in this zone. For instance, in the summer, polar days occur. Vegetation is only possible during a few months per year and even it is often sparse.

Precipitation intensity is always high, and it is a hot continent. Warm and hot climates prevail all over Africa, but mostly the northern part is marked by aridity and high temperatures. Only the northernmost and the southernmost fringes of the continent have a Mediterranean climate (see Figure 2.4).\nThe equator runs through the middle of Africa, as do the Tropic of Cancer and the \nTropic of Capricorn, making Africa the most tropical of all the continents. Africa’s position is relatively unique in the sense that it almost has a mirror image of climate zones to the north and South of the Equator with regard to latitude.

This covers mainly parts of Central Africa which includes \nthe Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon and Cameroon. It is also experienced in \nthe Southern part of Nigeria, Ghana, Benin and Sera Leone. Highland and coastal areas, especially in Eastern Africa, experience modified equatorial climate where the temperature is much lower than it is experienced in the true equatorial climate.\nIn the Equatorial climate, temperatures are very high throughout the year averaging \nabout 26° C, the hottest months in the year are March and September when the sun is \noverhead at the equator. The diurnal temperature range is very low, about 3 °C. There \nis often heavy cloud cover and the humidity is high throughout the year. This region mainly receives convectional rainfall.\nII. The Tropical Wet-and-Dry Region\nThe tropical wet-and-dry region  is often called the savanna climatic region; this \nimplies, incorrectly, that all areas with savanna vegetation have this type of climate. This region covers a little less than half of the total surface area of the continent, extending toward the Equator from the semiarid areas. The great distinguishing feature of this climatic region is the seasonal character of its rainfall. During the period of high sun, the maritime air masses produce up to six months of rainfall, the length of the rainy season depending on the nearness to the Equator. The rest of the year is dry. In a few places, for example, on the coast of Mauritania and Senegal, there is also a little rainfall in the period of low sun. As in the desert and semiarid climatic zones, mean monthly temperatures show less variation than daily temperatures. In western Africa, the period of low sun corresponds to the harmattan season. The harmattan is a warm, dry, northeasterly or easterly wind that blows out of the southern Sahara and is frequently laden with large quantities of sand and dust.\nRegions with the equatorial, or tropical wet, type of climate, or variants, are the \nwettest in Africa. There are two peak periods of rainfall corresponding to the double passage of the inter-treopical convergence zone (ITCZ). Because areas with an equatorial climate are constantly covered by warm maritime air masses, variations in their monthly and daily temperatures are less pronounced than in the tropical wet-and-dry regions.\nMarked variations in the rhythm of equatorial climate sometimes occur. For example, \nthe rainfall may be monsoonal or the second rainy season may not exist at all."

Some of the explanations about these variations include: the presence of a cold body of water off-shore chills the lower of the maritime air mass and makes it stable; the body of cold air that forms offshore diverts the incoming airstreams to the west and east of the anomalously dry area; there is a strong tendency for the winds to blow parallel to the shore during the rainy seasons; the absence of highlands deprives the region of Orographic (mountain) rainfall; fluctuations in the offshore moisture-bearing winds occur during the rainy season and reduce rainfall; and that local meteorological peculiarities of thunderstorms contribute to the reduction in rainfall.\nIn Eastern Africa, the tropical climate type is experienced in Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, \nTanzania and Somalia. Similarly in Central Africa, it is experienced in Zambia, Malawi, Angola, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe.\nIn the northern and southern extremities of the continent, there is a dry summer \nsubtropical, or the Mediterranean type of climate. Rain falls only in winter (December–January in North Africa, June–July in Southern Africa), although in some localities it may fall in autumn (September in North Africa, April in Southern Africa). Mean monthly temperatures are lower than in tropical climates, dropping to about 10 °C in winter, while summer (June–July in North Africa, and December–January in Southern Africa) temperatures may sometimes exceed those of tropical climates. Clear and blue skies are the common characteristics of this climate region.\nIII. Semi-arid Climatic Region\nThis region fringes the desert areas and include the greater part of the land south of the Zambezi River. They differ from true desert regions in being just within reach of the ITCZ in the course of its seasonal movement and therefore receiving more rainfall. Temperatures are about the same as those in the desert regions.\nIV.The Hot Desert Climatic Region \nHot deserts are places where there is little or no rainfall. The hot desert region consists of the Sahara and Kalahari deserts, which are always under the influence of dry continental tropical air masses, and the northern Kenya–Somali desert, the aridity of which is principally caused by the stable nature of the maritime air masses that pass over it throughout the year. The stability of these maritime air masses is induced by their passing over the cool body of water offshore. In addition to aridity,"

At night, temperatures are very low, dropping to below 10º C. The skies are clear and because of this, the heat received from the sun during the day is quickly lost back into the atmosphere at night. \nV.Humid Subtropical Climatic Region\nThis climate type is found in Eastern side of continents between 200 and 350 north \nand south latitudes. The humid subtropical climate is a transition between the tropical and temperate climates. In Africa this climate type is confined to the southeastern coast of South Africa. The region is characterized by a relatively high temperature with warm and wet climate. In Koppen’s classification the humid subtropical climate is constitutes of two climates (Cfa and Cwa) as shown on figure 2.4. \nVI. Mediterranean Climate Region\nThis climate is also called Warm Temperate Western Margin Climate and it is experienced in very small areas of the continent. The Mediterranean climate is best developed on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. It is also experienced in the South-Western tip of Africa. Temperatures in the Mediterranean climate region range from 10º C in winter to about 21º C in summer. These areas lie in the path of westerly winds. In the summer season, winds blow from the land to the sea. Therefore, they are dry winds. Winters are wet because cool moist winds blow towards the land from the sea. The influence of moist westerly winds also makes the winters mild. The  average amount of rainfall each year is about 500-750 mm.\nVII. The Warm Temperate East Coast Climate Region\nThe climate is experienced between latitudes 30º - 40º North of the Equator and 30º-40º South of the Equator. It is experienced along the Eastern coast of South Africa, especially in Natal and Cape Provinces, as well as in Mozambique. These areas are under the strong influence of the warm Mozambique current and the warm southeast trade winds. Summer temperatures are generally high with an average of about 26ºC. Winter temperatures are low, averaging about 10º C. Annual rainfall is between 1000 - 1500 mm per year but it decreases as one moves westwards into the interior."

Most of the rain falls during the winter season and averages about 700 mm per year. The Eastern areas are wetter than those in the West which are close to the Kalahari Desert. The annual temperature ranges from about 26º C in summer to about 10º C in winter.\nIX. The Mountain Climatic Region\nThis climate region includes the high mountain areas of Kenya, Ethiopia and the lakes region of East Africa. In some respects, the climate is similar to the warm temperate upland climate, except the temperatures are even lower and snow occurs on the tops of the highest peaks, such as Kilimanjaro. The area receives more rainfall than the surrounding areas. It mostly receives relief rainfall, formed as the warm moist winds are forced to rise up the highlands. The highest amount of rainfall is received on the windward slopes. At the lower slopes, the mountains are warmer and wetter. The slopes facing away from the sea are called leeward or rain shadow slopes. They receive little or no rain. The winds here are descending and have a cooling effect. Temperature decreases with an increase in altitude. At the very top of high mountains, temperatures are below freezing point.\n/gid00039/gid00072/gid00070/gid00084/gid00081/gid00068/gid00001/gid00019/gid00015/gid00021/gid00027 Climate Zones of Africa based on Köppen’s Classification"

How do these factors \ncontrol the continent’s climate?\nThere are several factors that influence the climate of the African continent. These \ninclude angle of the sun, latitude, air pressure, wind system and the Intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), major ocean currents, land and water (maritime versus continental) influence, and altitude. These factors determine the amount of temperature and precipitation. Below is the description of each one of the factors.\nI.Latitude and its influence on Solar Radiation received\nAfrica straddles the Equator from 37⁰ N to 34⁰ S, hence it lies within the tropics. Variations in the receipt of solar energy and temperature differences are largely a function of latitude. Temperature is high throughout the continent because of the continent’s location relative to Equator. As latitude increases, the sun shines more obliquely and provides less energy. The equator, however, faces the sun’s rays directly, so the climate is warm year-round. \nII.Pressure Systems, Winds, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone \n(ITCZ)\nLocated on about Latitude 30oNorth and South of the Equator are Sub-tropical High-\nPressure Belts that dictate surface wind patterns and influence rainfall and temperature regimes on the continent. The Subtropical High-Pressure Systems on both sides of the Equator generate two wind systems that converge on the equator in a zone termed as Inter-Tropical Converge Zone (ITCZ). From the north, Subtropical High-Pressure Belt zone blows the Northeast Trade Winds (locally called Harmattan). The Harmattan is dry and cool and blows over Sub-Saharan Africa from about November to April. From the south Sub-tropical High Pressure belt zone blows the Southwest Trade Winds (locally called Monsoon)."

The \nAfrican continent does not extend much beyond 35oof latitude from the equator. \nThe implication is that the range of climatic conditions is limited and that the general direction of wind movement is towards the equator (or in more accurate terms towards the inter-tropical convergence zone - ITCZ). The ITCZ shifts with the seasonal movement of the sun across the tropics:\n• In June: the northern summer season, the ITCZ is located at about 13 \ndegrees of latitude in North Africa at the southern boundary of the Sahara.\n• In December, the Northern winter season, the ITCZ moves southward \nalong the West African Coast and to the northern and eastern margins of the Congo basin and continues to Madagascar.\nMovements in the ITCZ are closely related to the distribution of rainfall and climatic zones. The climatic zones assume symmetry around the equator, although the high altitudes in some parts of the continent and the adjacent disturb the symmetry."

Major Ocean Currents\nWinds that tend to blow persistently over the ocean tend to drag a thin surface \nlayer of the water in their direction of flow. This layer of ocean water called Ocean \nCurrent dictates the temperature and moisture characteristics of the wind and the \ncoastal regions over which the wind blows. When ocean currents blow from low latitudes (near to the equator) towards higher latitudes (towards the pole) the currents carry Warm ocean water into relatively cool regions. Such an ocean current is called Warm Ocean Current. \nWarm Ocean Currents supply moisture to winds blowing over them to develop \nrainfall on the adjacent coasts. In Africa, Warm Ocean Currents include Warm Guinea \nCurrents - in West Africa, Warm Mozambique Currents – in Southeast Africa. \nThe cool surface of Cool Ocean Currents causes moisture in winds blowing over \nthem to condense and form fogs, etc. The winds are deprived of their moisture so \nthey tend to absorb rather than deposit moisture at the adjacent coasts. Cool currents, therefore, cause dry conditions and in Africa the Cool Canary Currents - the \nwestern coast of the Sahara Desert, the Cool Benguela Currents – the Western \ncoast of Kalahari Desert. The cool ocean currents tend to create rich fishing grounds. Rich fishing grounds exist along the Morocco and Spanish Saharan Coasts that are washed by the Cool Canary Currents. The Namibian coast that is washed by the Cool Benguela current also has rich fishing grounds.\nIV.Distribution of Land and Water\nLarge water bodies such as the Ocean and huge lakes modify climates in adjacent lands. In the continental interior, where there are no large bodies of water, temperatures get very warm in summer or during the day. The land is solid, so it \nheats up more rapidly during the day. The compact nature of the land means that only a thin surface gets heated. As a result, heat absorbed into the thin layer of surface rocks is released very rapidly. The land surface is, therefore, very cool at night and in \nwinter. The interior location does not also allow rainfall to reach such places thereby creating warm, humid, hot and dry climates. These extremities in climate affect all states located in the interior of continents. Such climates are called Continental \nClimates as against Maritime Climates experienced on lands located along coasts. \nIn places such as Timbuktu in Mali the diurnal and annual ranges in temperature are very high because of continentality ."

On the other hand, regions of extreme climatic conditions like the deserts, rainforests, and  polar regions have fewer people. \nAfrica is a continent with a diversity of climate landscapes. It has a climate that ranges \nfrom intense heat to bitter cold in its different parts. This diversity in turn influences the living style of people including settlement patterns, livelihood options,  resource endowments, health ,and wellbeing. The relationship between climate, physical resources ,and socio-economic condition of people in Africa is briefly presented in the following section.\n2.3.1 Climate and Agriculture in Africa\nIt is indisputable that agriculture is the backbone of Africa’s economy and accounts for the majority of livelihoods across the continent. Agriculture is an extremely important sector on the African continent, on average accounting for 70% of the labor force and over 25% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Agriculture has always been deeply dependent on the weather, with farmers needing a steady mixture of sun, warmth, and rains to reliably produce the crops they need. The bulk of agricultural systems in Sub-Saharan Africa are highly climate-dependent: the region is marked by a strong dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources. Africa is one of the continents that are most highly affected by climate change for two reasons: its geographical characteristics of having a major land lying across the warming tropics, and the limited human, social, and economic capacity that African countries have to adapt to the impacts of climate change. A change in a climate, therefore, exacerbates the complexity of issues (such as few technological inputs, the majority of Africa’s farmers working on a small-scale or subsistence level and have few financial resources, limited access to infrastructure, and, etc.) in the continent. \n2.3.2 Climate and Health in Africa\nClimate change has widespread effects on human health by impacting both environmental and social determinants.\nHumans have understood the importance of climate to human health since ancient \ntimes. In some cases, the connections appear to be obvious. For instance, a flood can cause drownings, a drought can lead to crop failure and hunger, and temperature"

In other cases, the connections are obscured by \ncomplex or unobserved processes, such that the influence of climate on a disease epidemic or a conflict can be difficult to diagnose. In reality, however, all climate impacts on health are mediated by some combination of natural and human dynamics that cause individuals or populations to be vulnerable to the effects of a variable or changing climate.\nAfrica is commonly described as a “climate-vulnerable” continent in which rainfall \nvariability, hydrological extremes, and anthropogenic climate change have the potential to inflict significant harm on a large population.\n2.3.3 Climate and Water Resources in Africa\nWater is the most important of all natural resources. Without water ,life  would not be able to thrive on the Earth. It has been argued that the level of streams, flow of streams/rivers, the volume of underground water and the like all depend on types of climates and water availability. Therefore, persistent climate change may lead to shrinkage in the surface-water supply as well as the quantity and regularity of streams and rivers, and water supplies in Africa.\nActivity 2.7\n1.What are the benefits of climate to other physical and socio-economic aspects \nof Africa?

Variability may be due to \nnatural internal processes within the climate system or to variations in anthropogenic (caused by human) external forcing. In other words, climate variations occur with or without our actions. It is critical to assess precisely which human actions affect climate and those that do not. Climate change, on the other hand, is a change in the state of the climate system, identified by changes in the average conditions and the variability of its properties, that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer, due to natural and/or anthropogenic processes and drivers.\nActivity 2.8\n1.What is climate change?

The risks of climate change on agricultural production, food security, water resources and ecosystem services will likely have increasingly severe consequences on lives and sustainable development prospects in Africa.\nMost studies on the potential impact of climate change have predicted that Africa is \nlikely to experience higher temperatures, rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns and increased climate variability, all of which could affect much of its population. The actual and potential impacts of climate change in Africa are large and wide-ranging, affecting many aspects of people’s everyday lives. Many climate models predict negative impacts of climate change on agricultural production and food security in large parts of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Higher temperatures, the drying up of soils, increased pest and disease, shifts in suitable areas for growing crops and livestock, desertification, floods, deforestation, and erosion are all signs that climate change is already happening. Therefore, this indicates that climate change is one of the greatest environmental, social and economic threats facing Africa. The impact of climate change is more serious on the world’s poorest countries, most of which are found in Africa. Poor people already live on the frontlines of pollution, disaster, and degradation of resources and land. For them, adaptation is a matter of sheer survival.\nUnfortunately, despite growing concern, no exact and reliable figures are available to \nquantify the economic costs of the negative impacts of climate change in Africa for either individuals or society as a whole. As far as development is concerned, climate change will have a strong impact on Africa’s ability to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Africa 2063 goal and on its development policies in general, with increased pressure on agriculture, water supply and demand, health, and political stability.\nIn general, African has been seriously affected due to the following reasons. First, the \nAfrican society is very closely coupled with the climate system, hundreds of millions of people depend on rainfall to grow their foods. Second, the African climate system is controlled by an extremely complex mix of large-scale weather systems. Third, the degree of expected climate change is large. The two most extensive land-based end-of- century projected decreases in rainfall anywhere on the planet occur over Africa, particularly in North and South Africa. Finally, the capacity for adaptation to climate change is low."

Weather refers to a short-term atmospheric condition – for example, the temperature and precipitation on a certain day, the state of the atmosphere with respect to heat or cold, wetness or dryness, calm or storm, clearness or cloudiness. On the other hand, a climate is an average of weather conditions in a place over a long period, 30 years or more. A climate, however, is more than just a generalization of weather, it includes extreme events and probabilities, it is the sum of all statistical weather information describing a place or region.\nThere are various classification schemes used by climatologists for categorizing the \nworld’s climate into different regions. The ancient Greeks classified the world climates into three: torrid, temperate, and polar. Later, since the beginning of the twentieth century, however, many climate-classification schemes have been devised that used long-term records of temperature and precipitation.\nThe most widely used and popular climate classification scheme  is developed by \nthe German Climatologist and Botanist Wladimir Köppen (1846-1940). Köppen classified the world climate regions into five. He used temperature for four of the climate regions and precipitation for the fifth one. In general, there are 4 (four) major global climate zones; namely the Tropical zone from 0°– 231/2° (between the tropics), the Subtropics from 231/2°– 40°, the Temperate zone from 40°–60°, and the Cold zone from 60°–90°. The characteristics of the climate zones change with great altitude differences within a small area, like in mountain areas, since temperatures decrease rapidly with altitude.\nThe climate of Africa is characterized by a range of climates such as the equatorial \nclimate, the tropical wet and dry climate, the tropical monsoon climate, the semi-arid climate (semi-desert and steppe), the desert climate (hyper-arid and arid), and the subtropical highland climate. The equator runs through the middle of Africa, as do the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, making Africa the most tropical of all the continents.\nIts position is relatively unique in the sense that it almost has a mirror image of \nclimate zones to the north and south of the Equator with regard to latitude. There are a number of factors that influence the climate of the African continent. These include the angle of the sun, latitude, air pressure, wind system and the ICTZ, major ocean"

These are the equatorial (tropical wet), semiarid, tropical wet-and-dry, hot desert, Mediterranean, humid subtropical marine, warm temperate upland, and mountain regions.\nClimate affects nearly every aspect of our lives from our food sources to our transport \ninfrastructure; from what clothes we wear, to where we go for recreation. It has a huge effect on our livelihood, our health, and our future. People’s settlement and living are hugely associated with climate types.

However, there are a few \nselected natural resources that we rely on more than others. Natural resources provide fundamental life support  in the form of both consumptive use and public \ngood services. Consumptive use is the use of resources in ways that reduce supply. Examples include mining and logging in a forest. Public good is a good that benefits many people whether or not they have paid for it. Here is a list of natural resources that are extremely important to the existence of life on Earth . \nI. Water\nThe first  natural resource  in the above list is water. Arguably, water is the most important of all natural resources. Without water, life would not be able to thrive on the Earth. About 71% of Earth’s surface is water and the oceans hold about 96.5% of that water.  \nWhile it is technically a renewable resource, the amount of fresh or drinkable water \nis very small in amount. There is only about 2.5% freshwater  from the total amount \nof water on Earth. Most of the freshwater cannot easily be accessed since it is found underground or in a form of ice and snow in remote areas.\nActivity 3.2 \n1.Why is water so important?

Air holds moisture which helps regulate temperature both on the surface and in humans. Meanwhile, oxygen is extremely important because every living thing needs oxygen to survive. Air also includes the atmosphere that is necessary for containing gases needed to keep the temperature of the Earth at a constant and warm enough to support life.\nAir also regulates the winds which are renewable resources. Windmills or turbines \nhave been created to harness this energy and use it to generate electricity. However, breathable air is becoming more and more polluted. In some areas of the world air pollution  is so great that people are forced to wear face masks so they do not breathe \nin any toxins. Air pollution can lead to many illnesses including cancer. There are many things that you can do to reduce air pollution most importantly by reducing the emission of carbon dioxide.\nActivity 3.4\n1.Give some examples by which you can reduce air pollution.  \nIII. Soil\nSoil as a resource, contains many minerals and nutrients that allow plants to grow. \nTherefore, it is important for the growth of plants and trees. Soil is also an agent of the nitrogen cycle . This is the process of taking nitrogen from the air and converting \nit into basic ingredients which let plants make their own food.\nSoil is another natural resource that is threatened by pollution. Soil pollution, caused \nby overgrazing, landfills, waste materials, fertilizers, pesticides, and other factors is a pressing issue for the land. It can result in low crop production, as well as plant life containing chemicals that are not ideal for human consumption. It can also result in desertification which means the land becomes barren and unable to support plant life. \nIV.Forest\nTrees help us in many ways. They produce oxygen, help to deal with the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and allow people to heat their homes. Moreover, forests are also home to incredible amounts of biodiversity, especially tropical rainforests. About 80% of the world’s species can be found in the tropical rainforests."

This is unwise \ndestruction of trees by cutting them down. The reason for this deforestation is for lumber, clearing of land for plowing, and other causes such as illegal logging and forest fires, etc. If we are to continue to thrive on this Earth, we have to start treating forests carefully and plant more trees annually.\nV.Minerals\nMinerals are very important for industrialization. Rare minerals found within the Earth are the raw material for making electronics like computers and cellphones. Whereas, iron and other minerals are highly used for building and construction purposes. Minerals are either metallic – that can be melted to gain new products \nor nonmetallic – a combination of minerals that do not produce new products \nby melting them. Since minerals are nonrenewable resources, wise utilization or sustainable use of the resources is vital. Hence, reuse and recycling of the resources are the most common methods used in the world today. \nActivity 3.5\n1.What do you think is your role in the sustainable use of natural resources? \nWhat can you do to avoid wastage and unwise use?\nVI. Oil\nOil is very essential natural resource. However, this is one of the very scarce non-\nrenewable natural resources. It is the cause of pollution, wars and conflict in many parts of the world. However, it is also what powers our lives. Nearly all of our transportation and manufacturing industries rely on petroleum products. \nHowever, because we are almost reliant on oil, our rapid use has reduced the total \namount of the resource by depleting it quickly. The general estimate is that the remaining reserves of oil will last possibly the next few decades. However, companies and governments are still pushing for fracking and drilling to continue at a rapid rate. If we want to hold on to the resource we have, we need to embrace other means of energy production. Shifting our reliability on renewable resources such as air, solar, and water is so important. There need to be a shift to green technology as well \nas diversification of economies of countries away from oil."

The Niger River, which \nrises in the mountains of Guinea (the Futa Jalon highlands) and enters the sea through its delta in southern Nigeria, is about 4,200 km. It is the third longest river in Africa. Rapids interrupt the Niger basin’s course at several points. \nThe Niger receives water from its largest tributary, the Benue, which flows from \nits left bank in Nigeria. The middle Niger was separated from the upper Niger by the Benue trough (a narrow depression) which became an inland lake, but dried up through a long time of evaporation, the remnants of which now form the inland Niger delta. \nFishing is an important activity across the river system. The discovery and exploitation \nof petroleum in the delta region, however, has seriously disrupted fishing as a result of pollution of the basin. Irrigation is largely practiced in the Niger valley. Many canals were constructed and huge tracts of irrigated land now produce rice, cotton, sugarcane, and vegetables. The Niger is also a source of hydroelectricity. The largest project is the Kainji Dam in Nigeria which was completed in the late 1960s. Most of the Niger River, more than three-fourths of its total length, is used by commercial shipping.

Its major tributary, the Vaal River, is one of its northern headwaters. The Orange and the Vaal rivers together have a combined length of about 2,092 km. \nNavigation is impossible throughout the river’s course because of its irregular \nflow, its constant interruption by falls and rapids, and the silting that occurs in its channels and at the river mouth. Large irrigation and hydroelectric projects have been hampered on much of the Orange River by the enormous amount of waterborne silt that clogs up reservoirs and reduces the storage capacity of dams.\n3.2.6 The Chad Basin\nThe Chad basin constitutes the largest inland drainage area in Africa. The basin’s main water body is Lake Chad. It is a shallow lake on the borders of Chad, Niger, and Nigeria in north central Africa. Its size varies seasonally from about 10,360 km\n2 to about 25,900 km2. Lake Chad sits within the Sahel, a semiarid strip of land \ndividing the Sahara Desert from the humid savannas. Hence, it is being affected by high temperature of the region which leads to very high seasonal evaporation.  Lake Chad is a shallow lake with a mean depth of 1.2 meters.

Hence, pastoralists \nlike the Fulani people and the Hausa agricultural communities from west Africa enter the Lake Chad lowlands on a seasonal basis. Generally, the economy of the people of the Lake Chad region is based primarily on fishing, subsistence and commercial agriculture, and animal husbandry. The people of the basin largely engage in the production of subsistence crops such as sorghum, corn (maize), millet, beans and vegetables. They also depend on forest products like gum arabic, honey, beeswax \nand firewood. Production of these products, however, has been adversely affected by the decline of the forested areas, aggravated by the explosive growth of cattle populations."

Soil is a product of their interactions. Soil forming processes are dependent on these interactions. Processes are generally significant up to 1-2 meters below the ground surface. The material below this depth is known as the soil parent material .\nSoil has also a number of key environmental, social and economic functions that are vital to life on Earth. It supplies water and nutrients to plants, at the same time soil protects water supplies by storing, buffering and transforming pollutants. Soil is the medium that enables us to grow our food, natural fiber and timber and it supports wildlife habitats. Soil is also a habitat that provides raw materials, preserves the past history and reduces the risk of floods. Without soil, the planet would not function.\nAfrica has very diverse soil types and soil qualities. While many areas have naturally \nproductive soils, large areas of Africa have severe limitations for growing crops because the soils are too shallow, too wet, too dry or lacking nutrients. These differences in soil types and qualities are mainly due to variations in the climate of the continent. Extreme climates of Africa lead to significant variation in the biological activities and the availabilities of essential nutrients in the soils. In hot, dry regions, the most productive agricultural soils are to be found along the major river valleys or around wells or oases. Therefore, many African farmers traditionally maintained soil fertility by practicing shifting cultivation or applying mineral fertilizers on their farmlands."

Mostly associated with high rainfall areas and very old (Tertiary) land surfaces, they are strongly leached soils that have lost nearly all of their weatherable minerals over time. As a result, they are dominated by stable products such as aluminum oxides, iron oxides and kaolinite which give Ferralsols their strong red and yellow colors. Levels of calcium and magnesium are very low. The binding of particles by iron oxides gives ferralsols an apparent sandy or silty feeling (pseudo-sand).\n/gid00039/gid00072/gid00070/gid00084/gid00081/gid00068/gid00001 /gid00020/gid00015/gid00018/gid00017/gid00027 Distribution of Calcisols in \nAfrica5. Calcisols\nSoil with significant accumulation of \ncalcium carbonates, generally found in dry areas (from Latin calcarius, lime rich)\nCalcisols occur in many parts of Africa, \nespecially where the climate is dry enough to allow the accumulation of calcium carbonate in the soil. They form through the leaching of carbonates from the upper part of the soil which precipitate when the subsoil becomes oversaturated, from carbonate-rich water moving through the soil or by the evaporation of water which leaves behind dissolved carbonates. Precipitated calcium carbonate can fill the pores in the soil, thereby acting as a cementing agent, and can form a solid hard pan (calcrete) that is impenetrable to plant roots. It covers 6% of the soils of Africa."

The activities \nof mountains, rivers, volcanoes, lakes and forests further consolidate the appearance of minerals. Ancient woodlands have been transformed over millions of years into fossil fuels such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal. The courses of rivers and the disturbances of landforms have exposed to the surface deposits of metals such as uranium, iron, copper, zinc and tin, as well as rock minerals such as phosphates. Africa’s rocks, soil, and volcanic activities are the source of some of the world’s greatest treasures – for example, platinum and cobalt.  \nIndustrial metals are a major industry in some African countries, making them key \nplayers in the global economy. Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia produce more than half of the world’s cobalt and a significant amount of its copper respectively. Other leading suppliers of industrial metals include Guinea of the bauxite (aluminum ore) and South Africa and Gabon of manganese.\nAfrica produces petroleum for the global market. Algeria and Libya together \npossess about 3 percent of the world’s known petroleum reserves, and many North African countries earn much of their foreign income from petroleum and natural gas. However, the continent’s largest petroleum producer is the West Africanountry Nigeria. Coal deposits exist in large reserves in the nations of Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and South Africa."

This sector has suffered from the legacy of colonialism . \nThe Europeans involved in a frantic race to conquer all of Africa and to exploit its natural resources by the 1880s. Surveyors in South Africa had found astonishing sources of copper in 1854, diamonds in 1867, and gold in the 1880s. Then the Europeans established mines throughout Africa. In south-central Africa, a chain of major copper mines stretched from Zambia to Democratic Republic of Congo. In western Africa miners produced diamonds and gold in Ghana and Sierra Leone, and tin and coal in Nigeria. Mining supported the economies of many colonial powers; hence, the profits went back to the mining industry and its owners in Europe. European colonial powers invested their money mainly in mining. They focused on the development of transportation to exploit mineral resources. Railroads were built to carry minerals to ports on the coasts – not to link major cities, populations, or other industries."

Mines and miners kept working and producing. Now European owners often granted a share of the profits, as well as taxes, to African governments. In some nations, the new governments seized ownership of the mines. But the results were often disastrous. The industries suffered from poor \nmanagement, lack of investment money, low selling prices, political turmoil, \noutdated machinery, and general neglect of the sector. Labor disputes remained common. As African economies faltered in the 1970s and 1980s, their governments fell in debt to Western banks and international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. These bodies pressured African nations to sell their mines and other industries to private investors, mainly international corporations.\nSeveral other factors limited the profitability of African mining in the late 1900s. \nFor the most part, the continent’s raw ores are exported to other countries for manufacturing. The ores are sold to other countries for much less than the \nprice of the goods made from them. Furthermore, changes in industrial processes worldwide have reduced the demand for copper, iron ore, and other metals. In Africa, the mining industry continues to be poorly connected to other industries and methods of transportation. In addition, diamond smuggling is widespread in illegal markets, drawing taxes and other profits away from African governments and companies. Finally, most mining operations in Africa today are on a large scale, and small companies find it hard to compete. Even so, small-scale mining – often for local use and not for profit, does exist in many African countries. \nActivity 3.12 \n1.List the problems Africa \nfaced in the utilization of its \nmineral resources2.Provide possible solutions \nto effectively use the mineral resources"

These are the tropical category and subtropical category. \nI. Tropical Category \n1. Tropical rainforest\nThe tropical rainforests are found in the central part of Africa, on both sides of the \nEquator and eastern coast of Madagascar. The rainforests are characterized by high rainfall, ranging from 1000 to more than 2000 mm/year, due to the permanency of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on the Equator. \nThe most extensive formation of the rainforests is found in the Guineo-Congolian \nlowland, concentrated in the Congo Basin. There are tall dense forests, which are more than 30 meters high with emergents up to 50 – 60 meters forming several strata. Some canopy species are deciduous, but the forest is evergreen or semi-evergreen. There is also abundant growth of Epiphytes. These are plants which grow on trunks and limbs of trees.

Here, rainfall decreases and the dry season is always long, about 6 - 7 months. Rainfall varies between 500 and 1000 mm. Temperature is always high, with mean temperature of the coldest month of 20°C. In these drier conditions, the predominant vegetation type is woodland."

It is the case in  the Sahelian zone and Kalahari, as well as the southwestern part of Madagascar. Rainfall is always less than 1000 mm and scarcely reaches 200 mm in the drier parts of the Tropical Shrubland. The mean temperature of the coldest month is generally more than 20°C, except in Kalahari where, due to the proximity of the sea, temperatures are lower (the mean temperature of the coldest month may drop down to 10°C).\nTropical shrubland also covers a large part of Somalia. However, Somalia has a \nunique characteristic. Even if it lies across the Equator and not further than 12°N, the climate is semi-arid or arid. Whereas the trade winds direction is parallel to the coast and does not bring much humidity. Moreover, in winter, the Indian monsoon reaches this part of Africa after crossing large continents. As a result of these phenomena, Somalia is dry, with annual rainfall between 400 and 750 mm and very high temperatures due to low latitude. The tropical shrubland is dominated by deciduous shrubland and thicket with Acacia. \n5. Tropical Desert\nThe tropical desert extends on the desertic African lands: Sahara, Karoo-Namib and the coastal zone of Somalia. Here, rainfall is lower than 200 mm and does not allow the growth of a continuous vegetation cover. Generally, only xerophytes or plants which grow in desert condition can be found in these areas. Meanwhile, woody vegetation can be found along the wadis in Sahara. The rest large surface is true desert.\n6. Tropical Mountain Forest\nThis is limited to highland areas above 800 to 1200 m above sea level. Here, as elevation increases temperature decreases and vegetation changes. So, we define Tropical Mountain Forests as submontane, montane and high elevation vegetation. All of them correspond with tropical vegetation types. The main mountains systems of tropical Africa are the Cameroon highlands, the mountains of Kenya, the Kivu ridge ,and the Ethiopian highlands. Some lower and isolated hills occur, such as Fouta Djalon, Jos and Mandara plateau in West Africa, Hoggar in Sahara or Windhoek Mountain in southern Africa. The central part of Madagascar is formed of a high range separating the western wide lowlands from the narrow eastern coastal plain. The climatic type of each mountain is characterized by lower temperatures and, often higher rainfall."

Between the lowland forest and the rather different montane forest, there is a submontane  transition zone. In many places, however, the \nvegetation of this transition zone has been destroyed by fire and cultivation. Montane forest, generally above 1500 - 2000 meters, is lower in structure than lowland and submontane forests. At the upper part of the montane level, an Ericaceous belt replaces the forest. Meanwhile, in an area above 3000 meters, it is followed by Afro-\nalpine shrublands and grasslands.\nII. Subtropical Category\n1. Subtropical Humid Forest\nThis vegetation zone is restricted in Africa to a narrow zone along the east coast of \nSouthern Africa, roughly between 25°S and 34°S. The coastal regions of the zone have moderately high and well-distributed rainfall. Annual rainfall is 800 - 1200 mm and the mean temperature of the coldest month 7°C to 15°C. The mean annual temperature diminishes from 22°C in the north to 17°C in the south. Further inland, climate changes rapidly over short distances. The natural vegetation is evergreen or semi-evergreen forest. Where the rainfall is too low to support forest, the vegetation changes into evergreen and semi-evergreen bushland and thicket.\n2. Subtropical Dry Forest\nThe subtropical dry forests are confined to the Mediterranean climates of North \nAfrica and South Africa, in an area that has a long dry season, 3 to 6 months in summer. Most of the rainfall (400 - 1000 mm/year) occurs in winter.\n3.

Wildlife of Africa\nAfrica  has more diverse wildlife than any other continent. The diversity and wealth of wildlife found in Africa is the result of diverse climate of the continent – which  ranges from intense heat to bitter cold. Its varied vegetation has given rise to a wide range of animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and insects. Africa is inhabited by the world’s fastest land animal cheetah, the biggest bird ostrich and the largest land animal elephant. \n1. Mammals\nAfrica is home to an astonishing variety of mammals. The continent’s herbivores, \nor plant-eating animals, ranging from elephants, rhinoceroses, and hippopotamuses \nto hoofed mammals, such as the giraffe and the African buffalo. Vast herds of \ngrazing animals, such as zebras and wildebeests, roam the open plains and savannas.

Africa is home to three kinds of large cats – lions, leopards, and cheetahs – and smaller felines \nsuch as the serval and wildcat, such as wild dogs, jackals, foxes, hyenas, civets, and weasels. \nDifferent species of monkeys and two species of great apes, the chimpanzee and the \ngorilla, live in Africa. The continent also has many species of lemurs, small animals that belong to the primate family, like monkeys and apes. Most lemurs live in trees and are nocturnal, or active at night, although a few are active by day. The island of Madagascar has the largest variety of lemurs in the world."

Meanwhile, in order to have \na better understanding of concepts related to natural resources an overview of the world’s major natural resources has been thoroughly discussed. Our planet has huge supplies of natural resources that we need to survive. However, our biggest challenge is to use resources without destroying or degrading the environment. Our quality of life and survival depends on our ability to use, rather than abuse, the environment. Therefore, sustainable use is the use of resources is very important.  Sustainable use refers to the use of resources in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term degradation of the environment, thereby maintaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of present and future generations.\nA drainage basin or watershed is an area of land where surface water from rain \nconverges to a single point at a lower elevation. This usually appears at the exit of the basin, where the main river joins another water body. Africa has some of the world’s largest and longest rivers. The Congo is the Earth’s second- largest river by volume in the world. Whereas, the Nile is the longest river in the world. River basins are found in every direction in Africa. The Niger is found in the west, Zambezi and Orange are found in the southern part and the Chad basin is in the center of Africa. These basins face several problems such as seasonal fluctuations and excessive flows and the challenges posed by climate change.  The best solution to these problems is planning and using  the water resources in a sustainable manner. \nAfrica has very diverse soil types and soil qualities. While many areas have naturally \nproductive soils, large areas of Africa have severe limitations for growing crops because the soils are too shallow, too wet, too dry, or lacking in nutrients. These differences in soil types and qualities are mainly due to variations in the climate of the continent. Extreme climates of Africa lead to significant variation in the biological activities and the availabilities of essential nutrients in the soils. Therefore, many African farmers traditionally maintained soil fertility by practicing shifting cultivation or applying mineral fertilizers on their farmlands.\nAfrica has also very diverse natural vegetation and wildlife. These diversities are the \nresult of its climate landscape. Therefore, the continent is endowed with huge tropical forests found in the central part of Africa. Other varieties include; shrubs and steppe vegetation of arid and semiarid areas to humid subtropical forests. Africa has more diverse wildlife than any other continent. The diversity and wealth of wildlife found in Africa is the result of the diverse climate of the continent – which ranges from intense"

Asia’s share of the world population rose from 58% to 61%, Africa from 10 to 13%, the Caribbean and Latin America from 8 to 9%. During the same period (1970 and 2021), the share of Northern America declined from 6% in 1950 to 5% in 1998, and Europe from 18% to 12% (Bureau of Census, 2000). According to Population Reference Bureau (2021), by the mid of 2020, the world has more than 7 billion people. The continent of Asia is the most populous comprising 59.4% of the world population followed by Africa (17.5%). Although Asia as a continent has a majority of the world’s total population in 2020, estimated at 4.6 billion, the continent of Africa has contributed substantially to the rapid increase in the world’s population during this time. On the other hand, the total number of inhabitants of Oceania was only 43 million making the continent the least populated. \nBecause of the large and increasing population size, the number of people added \nto the global population will remain high for several decades, even as growth rates continue to decline as it was observed in recent times.

As some historical sources indicate, Africa’s population had been increasing very slowly until recent times. However, since 1950, the continent’s population began to increase very rapidly. As a result, the continent’s population experienced a rapid rise in number as opposed to other parts of the world.

The total population as of 2018 was estimated to be more than 1.3 billion, with a growth rate of 2.5% per year. \nThis appears to be the highest rate in the world and twice as fast as the world’s \naverage growth rate. In terms of the period that Africa’s population needs to double itself, the continent has the world’s shortest doubling time. Such a rapid population growth rate and short doubling time is the result of the very high fertility rate that the continent has. Although birth rate  is declining in the continent, it is still high when \ncompared to the rest of the world. The declining mortality in the continent is also the highest in the world. The difference between the two has produced a very high rate of population growth and a short period of doubling time in Africa.\nAfrica’s massive population growth in such a short period has also come with many \ninterrelated challenges and opportunities. Some of the challenges include producing sufficient food to feed such a large number of people, providing healthcare, environmental degradation, increasing scarcity of freshwater, emigration of millions of Africans out of the continent, and providing adequate education to the hundreds of millions of young people living inside the continent. \nA. Factors Responsible for Africa’s Rapid Population Growth \nMany interrelated factors  have contributed to the rapid and consistent growth of Africa’s population from 1950 to 2020. Many of these interrelated factors are demographic, while others are socioeconomic. Combined, these interrelated factors have come to be the engine behind Africa’s rapid and massive population growth in the post-World War era."

Fertility Patterns \nFertility refers to the occurrence of birth in the human population. It is a natural \npositive factor that tends to increase the human population size. Demographers use different measures to analyze human fertility. In this section, the fertility patterns of Africa are discussed using measures of fertility like Total Fertility Rate and Crude Birth Rates. \nDefinitions\nTotal Fertility Rate (TFR): is the average number of children a woman would \ngive birth to during her lifetime if she were to pass through her \nchildbearing years (15-49 years) experiencing the present-day age-specific fertility rates.\nCrude Birth Rate (CBR):  is the number of live births occurring among the population \nof a given geographical area in a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population during the same year. For example, when we say the crude birth rate of Africa was 33/1000 by the mid of 2020, we mean that 33 births occurred for every 1000 people, on average, during the year under consideration.\nMathematically, \nCBRTota lmid year populationTota lannua lnumbe roflivebirthsx1000 =-dn"

For example, in 2004 TFR was 5.1 and stood at 4.7 children per woman in 2016 (Table 4.4). When compared with other continents, Africa’s fertility rates of 4.5 children per woman in 2017 seem high. Indeed, it has been the highest in the world. However, that figure is low compared with Africa’s birth rate   in previous decades. For instance, the total fertility rate stood at an average of 6.6 children per woman in 1980.\nIn spite of these declines, compared with other regions of the world, as it has been \nindicated in the previous paragraph, African countries still experience relatively high fertility - explained as a function of early sexual debut among women due to early marriage and unmet need for family planning. The proportion of individuals below 15 years is also projected to decline gradually to 36% in 2030 from 46% in 1990; on the other hand, those aged 15 to 59 years will increase from 456 million people in 2010 to reach 758 million in 2030. \nTable 4.4: Total Fertility Rate for Africa by Region\nMajor Regions Year\n2004 2008 2012 2016 2020\nNorthern Africa 3.4 3.0 3.1 3.4 2.9\nWestern Africa 5.8 5.7 5.4 5.4 5.1\nEastern Africa 5.7 5.4 5.1 4.8 4.3\nCentral Africa 6.4 6.1 5.9 6.0 5.8\nSouthern Africa 2.9 2.8 2.5 2.5 2.4\nSource: Population Reference Bureau Reports (2019)"

For example, Northern Africa has shown little change in the total fertility over the last two decades. In 2004, the total fertility for Northern Africa was 3.4 children per woman, which is the same in 2016 again even though it slightly declined to a TFR of 2.9 by 2020. Fertility change in Central Africa has stagnated at around 6 children per woman. The lowest fertility rate is in Southern Africa followed by Northern Africa while the highest is in Central Africa followed by Western Africa while in eastern Africa the total fertility rate stands at 4.3 in 2020 (Table 4.4).\nIn addition to TFR, the Crude Birth Rate can also be taken as a means of analyzing \nthe fertility pattern of human population. The crude birth rate refers to the occurrence of the annual number of live births for every 1000 of the mid-year total population. Even by this measure, Africa has the highest fertility in the world. For instance, according to the UN World Population Data Sheet for the year 2020, the Crude Birth Rate (CBR) for Africa is estimated to be 33 per 1000 population. This is the peak even for the standard of less developed countries, which is 20 per 1000 population.\nAlthough fertility is high in Africa, it still varies from country to country or region to \nregion.

Mortality Patterns in Africa \nMortality refers to the occurrence of death in the human population. It is a natural \nnegative factor that tends to decrease the human population size. The level of mortality in a population can be measured by the crude death rate (number of deaths per thousand inhabitants), the infant mortality rate (number of infant deaths per thousand live births) and life expectancy (a summary measure of death risks/survival chances over different ages). Of these, the infant mortality rate is the most widely used indicator of the general health situation in a country.\nIn this section, mortality patterns in Africa are discussed using measures of mortality \nlike Crude Death Rate (CDR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), Maternal Mortality Rate and Life Expectancy."

Much progress is nonetheless expected in child and infant mortality rates: child mortality (i.e. death of children before reaching five years of age) is projected \nto decline from 116 per 1000 live births in 2010 to 75 per 1000 live births in 2030 (Figure 4.4) due to better incomes, access to improved water supply and sanitation, and better health facilities."

Age Structure \nHow do you describe the age composition of Africa’s population?\nThe age structure of a population can be expressed by the distribution of population into young, working and old age groups. Thus, one can deduce that Africa is a continent that is characterized by the dominance of the young age population. The age structure of the population can also be expressed from the median age perspective. If the median age is low, it implies that the population is young. For example, Africa’s median age has been 19.7 years by the mid of 2020. In contrast, if the median age is high, the population is likely to be adult and old age groups. For example, the median age for Europe has been 42.5 years by the mid of 2020. Low median age reflects high fertility and high population growth rates whereas high median age prevails in a population where the population growth rate is low and slow."

In developing continents like Africa, the level of fertility is very high; and the rate of population growth is high, too. This is readily attributed to their predominantly young age structure. As high fertility persists, the pressure on scarce resources for development increases. The demand for food, education, health facilities, employment opportunities, housing and other services also increases. In order to maximize these needs to meet the demand of the growing population, physical and institutional infrastructures have to be increased abundantly. The persisting high rate of population growth constantly dwarfs whatever is achieved in the economic sector. Resources, which could be used for development purposes, could be shifted to the provision of basic supplies for the additional members.\nB. Sex Structure \nThe sex structure of the population can be expressed using a sex ratio. It refers to the proportion of males to females in the overall population of a given area. The sex ratio is expressed in terms of the number of males for every 100 females.\nSexRatioNumber offemale populationNumber ofmale populationx100 =dn\nThe proportion of the two sexes in the population of a region has an impact on \nother demographic elements such as marriage rate, fertility, occupational structure, growth, etc."

Population Pyramid\nA very effective and quite widely used method of graphically depicting the age-sex composition of a population is called a population’s pyramid. A population pyramid is designed to give a detailed picture of the age-sex structure of a population, indicating either single age or 5-year groups, or other age combinations. The basic pyramid form consists of bars, presenting age groups in ascending order from the lowest to the highest pyramid horizontally one on another. The bars for males are given on the left of a central vertical axis and the bars for females are on the right of the axis.\nThe number of males or females in the particular age group is indicated by the length \nof the bars from the central axis. The age scale is usually shown stranding the central axis although it may be shown at the right or left of the pyramid only, or both on the right and left, perhaps in terms of both age and year of birth. In general, the age groups in a given pyramid must have the same class interval and must be represented by bars of equal thickness. Most commonly pyramids show 5-years age groups. \nTypes of Population Pyramids\nWhile all countries’ population pyramids differ, three types have been identified by the fertility and mortality rate of a country. \ni.Expansive pyramid \nA population pyramid showing a broad base, indicating a high proportion of children, a rapid rate of population growth, and a low proportion of older people."

This type of pyramid indicates a population in which there is a high birth rate, a high death rate and short life expectancy. It is the typical pattern for less economically developed countries, due to little access and incentive to use birth control, negative environmental factors and poor access to health care. \nii.Constructive Pyramid\nWith a population pyramid showing lower numbers or percentages of young people (ages 1 -14), the country will have a large elderly or aging population. Such a population pyramid usually displays a population percentage of ages 1-14 fewer than 30% and ages 75 and above over 6%. This is considered as an “aging population” that generally occurs in developed counties with adequate health services.\niii.Stationary Pyramid \nA population pyramid showing an unchanging pattern of fertility and mortality (fertility and mortality are balanced), i.e., B = D, where, B = Birth, D = Death and Population growth rate is zero.\nAs a result of the nature of population distribution into different age categories \n(i.e., young, working and old), most developing countries are characterized by expansive type of population pyramid which is almost triangular by shape. This kind of population pyramid has a broad base and tapering apex. The broader base is due to a high level of fertility among the population that results in high population growth rate. On the other hand, the tapering apex is typically indicative of low life expectancy. The population pyramid of most developing countries resembles the one indicated in Figure 4.7. \nContrary to developing countries, since the level of fertility is less and life expectancy \nis high in most developed countries, they are best expressed by the type of population pyramid that is narrower at the base and that becomes wider at the top."

These include \neconomic activities, social and cultural diversities in the continent. Africa is very resourceful region in the world. Nevertheless, the continent faces huge economic problems. Its economy is not as diversified as other diversities we find in the continent. Therefore, its people are largely engaged in primary economic activity.\nAfrica needs a very strong commitment to come out of the cycles of poverty, high unemployment, \nand economic problems. Specially, it has to seek solutions to the problem of unemployment. Therefore, the leaders of Africa have come together and set goals called Agenda 2063. The agenda aims to foster economic development, political integration, improvements in democracy and justice, establishment of security and peace on the entire African continent. \nCulture is a manifestation of socio-religious and economic condition, the standard of living, \nlevel of technology and people’s environmental perception. It is abstract or intangible; however, it can be defined by elements like language, religion, ethnicity, rituals, customs, traditions, and tools. The society has the maximum bearing of religion. It is the religion which compels people to adopt certain kinds of economies, dresses, food habits, and beliefs. It also commands people to learn certain languages, and provides some restrictions at the time of cultural mingling. All other variables are directly or indirectly controlled by religion."

When an economy highly relies on the extraction of basic natural resources through mining, fishing, agriculture, and forestry it faces several challenges. \nA. Primary Sector in Africa\ni. Agriculture\nAgriculture is by far the single most important economic activity in Africa. It \nprovides employment for about two-thirds of the continent’s working population and it contributes on average 30 to 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and about 30 percent of the value of exports to each country. However, most agriculture in Africa is rain-fed and therefore very vulnerable to climate variability that is characterized by frequent droughts and occasional floods, which at times destroy crops and livestock.\nii. Mining\nMining is one of the major economic activities in Africa. Africa has huge mineral \nresources (see Unit Three). Therefore, due to Africa’s mineral wealth and the global demand for mineral resources such as copper, gold, platinum, diamonds, etc. the mining sector actively operates in Africa. \niii. Forestry\nAfrica is rich in forests and woodlands. Africa has 624 million hectares under forests, \nwhich comprise 20.6 percent of the continent’s land area and 15.6 percent of the world’s forest cover. Forests and trees support many African national economies by supplying a variety of products and services to rural and urban communities. In addition, many wildlife and game parks are in forested areas. \niv. Fishery\nFish, fishing and fisheries are an integral part of the culture and economy of Africa. \nFisheries play significant economic and nutritional roles in the continent. The sector contributes to food and nutrition security, and provides jobs, in particular for coastal populations, which are often among the poorest and most vulnerable."

Secondary Sector in Africa\nThe sector is made up of activities that process basic materials obtained by the primary \nsector, and turn them into new goods and products.  An example could be copper ore transformed into an electric cable. In Africa the secondary sector is growing at a rapid pace in recent decades, but Africa is not keeping up with worldwide improvements in the manufacturing industry. Africa has a large selection of manufacturing consisting of textiles, clothing, footwear, and the manufacturing of basic woods and metals. Electricity, gas, and water industries in the secondary sectors have been markedly fluctuating  over the past decades. They appear to be very sensitive to changing \neconomic trends.\nC. Tertiary Sector in Africa\nThe tertiary sector consists of a range of service activities. It involves the selling \nof services and skills. Meanwhile, selling goods and products from primary and secondary industries are also involved in the service sector.  Services related \nto transport, storage, communication, and real estate have shown significant improvement in Africa in recent decades. The growth in the hospitality industry, represented by hotels and restaurants, indicates the growing importance of tourism in many African countries. Hence, tourism in Africa depends directly on the continent’s natural resources and biodiversity base."

Some of the problems include \nlimitations in technological capabilities, overdependence on aids, poor economic structure, and poor education, among others.\n1. Limitations in Technology \nImprovements in technological capacity are the key to development. It helps countries to create, access and use Information Communications Technology (ICT) in solving socio-economic problems. In addition, innovation in science and technology is bringing significant changes in agriculture, medicine, and transportation among other sectors. Technological capability, therefore, brings the major difference between the developed and developing countries in the world. Hence, developed countries in Europe, North America and Asia have transformed their economies through the advancement of their technological capacities and improvement in human capital.  Therefore, to be successful, African countries should invest in technology because limitation in technology capabilities is among the factors that hinder economic growth in Africa.\n2. Over-dependence on Foreign Aids\nIn Africa, many countries highly depend on development partners to finance their development projects. Some sectors such as education, health and agriculture rely on foreign development partners to function. Over-relying on foreign aid leads to the stagnation of the economy of a country. Many African countries now have large percentages of their budgets financed by foreign donations. The main problem such as dependence on aid is that instead of engaging in activities that facilitate economic growth, the countries wait for aids to enhance their education and infrastructure. Therefore, African countries should engage in activities that generate revenue through trade and investment rather than depending on foreign aids."

Poor Structures of the Economy\nSince most African countries could not adopt improved science and technology, \nthey have not changed their economic structures since the time of independence. Therefore, they are still exporting raw materials that include cocoa, diamond, gold, bauxite, and gold in their raw forms. Thus, they do not add value to raw materials as \na way of increasing their earnings in a global market. African countries still import products of light industries like toys, matches, and toothpicks among other products from other regions. This will in turn hinder its economic growth. Therefore, African countries should take the initiative to embrace technology in the manufacturing sector and establish better economic structures.\n4. Poor Education\nEducation is very important for the development of a country. Education promotes \nentrepreneurship by producing a skilled workforce. Countries get the knowledge and skills for manufacturing from quality education. However, the current education that the African countries are offering to students is yet to produce graduates that can take up the task of enhancing the African economy. African education system should, therefore, be changed to equip students with the information and skill that can help them to be competent in the global market activities.\nGenerally, the poor status of the economy of Africa has led the continent to face \nhigh unemployment. The Africa has the world’s highest rate of working poverty – \npeople who are employed but earning less than US$2 a day. Youth unemployment and underemployment  are among the main barriers to development in Africa. The \nexclusion of young people from the labor force causes generational cycles of poverty to continue and put countries into vicious cycles of poverty. It also breaks down \nsocial cohesion and can be associated with higher levels of crime and violence among idle youth. It also leads a large number of the youth to migrate taking very dangerous routes towards the developed regions."

Effects of Unemployment\nUnemployment affects both the workers and the economy of a country or region. It \ncauses workers to suffer financial hardship. Then, it affects families, relationships, and communities. Unemployment results in reduced demand for goods and services. Low level of consumption and buying power of citizens, in turn, causes lower profits for businesses. Finally, businesses may disappear and governments may reduce budget and workforce as they lose income from taxes. \nIII. Solutions for Unemployment\n1. The Creation of more Job OpportunitiesThe workforce of any country usually makes up a large part of its population. In order to satisfy the needs of its people, all countries should ensure that they create many job opportunities so that the people who are eager to work, get the chance to do so. In addition, governments should ensure that people are paid adequately for the services which they provide so that no person feels like he or she has been overworked and paid less."

The concept of sustainable development was described by the Brundtland Commission Report (1987) as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”\nThere are four dimensions to sustainable development – society, environment, \nculture, and economy – which are intertwined, not separate. Sustainability is a \nparadigm for thinking about the future in which environmental, societal, and economic considerations are balanced in the pursuit of improved quality of life. For example, a prosperous society relies on a healthy environment to provide food and resources, safe drinking water and clean air for its citizens.

It is lowest in Europe and highest in the Middle East. Income inequality requires global solutions. This involves improving the regulation and monitoring of financial markets and institutions, encouraging development assistance, and foreign direct investment to regions where the need is greatest. Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also a key to bridging the widening divide.\nGoal 11 \nSustainable cities \nand communities  Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way cities are built and managed. The rapid growth of cities – a result of rising populations and increasing migration, has led to a boom in mega-cities, especially in the developing world, and slums are becoming a more significant feature of urban life. Therefore, it requires governments to make sustainable cities by creating career and business opportunities, safe and affordable housing, and building resilient societies and economies. It also involves investment in public transport, creating green public spaces and improving urban planning and management in participatory and inclusive ways.\nGoal 12 \nResponsible \nconsumption \nand productionAchieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological footprint by changing \nthe way we produce and consume goods and resources. The efficient management of our shared natural resources, and the way we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants, are important targets to achieve this goal. Encouraging industries, businesses, and consumers to recycle and reduce waste is equally important, as is supporting developing countries to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption by 2030.\nGoal 13 \nClimate actionEvery country is experiencing the drastic effects of climate change. Supporting vulnerable regions will directly contribute not only to Goal 13 but also to the other SDGs. These actions must also go hand in hand with efforts to integrate disaster risk measures, sustainable natural resource management, and human security into national development strategies.\nGoal 14 \nLife below waterThe SDGs aim to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems from pollution, as well as address the impacts of ocean acidification. Enhancing conservation and the sustainable use of ocean-based resources through international law will also help mitigate some of the challenges facing our oceans."

Other differences include the nature of belief in a supernatural power, the history of how the world and the \nreligion began, and the use of sacred texts and objects. Therefore, there is a very \ndiverse religious system in the world. \nAfrica is home to many religions and beliefs. It contains a mixture of both local \nbeliefs and global beliefs. Although religion in Africa is multifaceted, it has largely influenced the art, philosophy, and culture of the continent. In today’s Africa, various individuals adhere to mostly Christianity, Islam, and traditional African \nbeliefs (folk religions). African religions are as diverse as the continent is varied. Nevertheless, long cultural contact, in degrees ranging from trade to conquest, has mixed some fundamental principles of the religions through generalizations, with indigenous religions of Africa.\nMany African countries have high scores of religious diversity index (RDI). The RDI \ncalculates scores for countries, based on the shares of eight major world religions (Christians, Muslims, Buddhists , folk religions , Hindus, Jews, other religions\nconsidered as a group, and the religiously unaffiliated). The index is on a scale from \n0 -10, with 10 being the maximum possible diversity if each of the eight groups constitutes an equal share of the population.

This resourceful continent faces serious economic problems. Hence, it largely engages in the extraction of raw materials from the natural environment. Overdependence of such economic activities widely exposes countries to fluctuations in earnings or national income. Thereby the economy suffers from stagnation and countries will be forced to heavily depend on foreign aid. Then they will be left in a poverty trap. \nTherefore, to address the factors that hinder economic growth in Africa, African \nleaders need to avoid over-relying on donations. Instead, they should take initiatives that will enable African countries to fund their budgets. Africa should also embrace technology because technology will enhance the growth of the economy especially in the manufacturing sector. It is only by embracing modern technology the African countries will stop importing products that they can produce and start adding value to raw materials before exporting them. The structures of the economies of African countries should also be designed in a way that it favors sectors that are important for the growth of the economy. Particularly investing in the industrial or manufacturing sectors is very important. The African education system should be changed to equip students with the right information so that they can participate in global market activities.\nIn addition, a stronger system of assessing unemployment should be put in place to \ndetermine its causes and how to address it better. Once more job opportunities are created, the unemployment rate is sure to come down a great deal.\nAs a possible solution to the multifaceted economic problems of Africa, its leaders \nhave come up with the formulation of Agenda 2063. The Agenda re-dedicates Africa towards the attainment of the Pan African Vision of “An integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its citizens, representing a dynamic force in the international arena.” It is also aligned with the UN’s Agenda 2030. \nAfrica is a very diverse continent in terms of language and religion. Africa is the \nmost linguistically diverse continent. Many African countries are multilingual. There are more than 2000 living languages in Africa. Meanwhile, Africa is home to many religions and beliefs. It contains a mixture of both local beliefs and global beliefs."

However, this challenge can be overcome if natural resources are sustainably used. Besides, the environment allows humans to make certain modifications for their survival. Hence, humans have made significant changes to the environment in a way that suits them. \nAs the global human population continues to grow, so do human impacts on the environment. \nTherefore, sustainable and equitable solutions are required to address the interconnected challenges of protecting the natural environment.

The two factors involved in the increase \nin the number of individuals in a population are fertility  (birth) and immigration\n(in migration). On the other hand, mortality (death) and emigration (out migration) decrease the number of individuals in a population. Understanding these changes at different spatial scales (local, national, regional and global scales) is very important for development planning. \nTherefore, understanding global population trends and anticipating the demographic \nchanges to come is crucial to the achievement of development goals that countries, regions or global communities plan. One among such plans is the 2030 Agenda \nfor Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda emphasizes that people are at the center of sustainable development. Population trends observed over the past few decades point to substantial progress made towards several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) so far. Examples include reduced mortality, particularly \namong children, as well as increased access to sexual and reproductive health care as \na result of population policies and family planning programs. \nRecent demographic trends in different countries and regions of the world are \nchallenges to sustainable development. For example, countries experiencing rapid population growth, most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa, must provide schooling and health care to growing numbers of children, and ensure educationand employment opportunities to increasing numbers of youth. Countries where \npopulation growth has slowed or ceased must prepare adequate health care for an increasing proportion of older persons. These and other challenges can be addressed in part by anticipating the future demographic trends and incorporating that information into policies and planning. \nSlave trade, colonization, and the spread of deadly diseases are the causes for \npopulation stagnation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Africa experienced stagnation of population size between 1500 and 1900. Its population size increased by only 20 million people from 80 million in 1500 A.D. to 100 million in 1900 A.D. Meanwhile, during this period population size of other regions (e.g., Asia, South America and North America) has increased three to fivefold. \nThe twentieth century witnessed the “demographic explosion” of the developing \nworld. Between 1900 and 1980, all developing regions including sub-Saharan Africa experienced high population growth. In particular, in sub-Saharan Africa population kept increasing.

This view was \ncommonly propagated by Europeans in the 19th century. However, the view that \nhuman activities are governed by the environment, primarily by the physical environment, was rejected in 1950s and substituted by environmental possibilism.\n2. Environmental possibilism: is the theory that asserts people can adapt to diverse \nenvironmental conditions and choose from many alternatives (possibilities), despite the limitations that the environment poses. Possibilism is the opposite of environmental determinism. Possibilism is a doctrine which claims that human beings have the capacity to choose between a range of possible responses to physical conditioning (environment).

The \nenvironment provides this element in various ways including rain, rivers, \nlakes and oceans. Human beings use water for drinking, washing, irrigation and power generation.\n•\tShelter: Some of the materials used in construction include sand, stones and \ntrees. The environment has an abundance of these raw materials and that is why human beings are able to build shelters.\n•\tClothing: Without clothing, human beings would find it difficult to cope with \nthe harsh elements of the climate. The environment provides raw materials, such as silk and cotton, which are all used in the manufacture of clothing products.\nMoreover, the natural environment plays an important role in supporting economic activities . Its contributions include:\n\tdirectly  by providing resources and raw materials such as water, timber and \nminerals that are required as input for the production of goods and services; and\n\tindirectly through services provided by ecosystems including carbon \nsequestration, water purification, managing flood risks and nutrient cycling.\nTherefore, the environment is vital for securing economic growth and development by providing natural resources.

Natural calamities like floods, drought, wildfires, earthquakes, and tsunamis are a few examples of nature’s negative impacts. Consequently, these negative impacts on the environment can cause large-scale migrations and death of people.\nHumans also have positive effects on the environment. Some human activities \nbring positive changes to the environment. For example, through afforestation and conservation , humans have greatly contributed to the functioning of the environment. Thus, humans can contribute to better air quality and make efforts to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as well as protect endangered species. \n6.2.3 Adaptation to the Environment\nPeople adapt to the environment  when changes occur to the existing environment or \nwhen they move to a new environment. Adaptation refers to an adjustment to a new environment so as to improve the chances of survival in that environment.

Therefore, it \ndemands an understanding of the existing vulnerability of individuals, households and communities. Moreover, the adaptation process requires that the most critical issues identified are addressed.\nNext to the analysis of impacts, adaptation strategies should be designed and \nimplemented. Then it is followed by monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness \nof activities planned. Finally, sharing knowledge and lessons learnt are the last part \nof the adaptation process. \nWell-planned adaptation strategies result in adaptation responses , that is an \nimplementation action to respond to the impacts of environmental changes that \nalready took place, as well as for future impacts.\nAdaptation responses can be grouped into the following broad categories:\nÞ\nTechnological solutions – grey measures;\nÞEcosystem based adaptation options – green measures; and\nÞBehavioral, managerial and policy approaches – soft measures.\nGreen and soft measures aim at decreasing the sensitivity and increasing the adaptive \ncapacity (adjust to the changes or using it as an opportunity and creating new mechanisms) of human and natural systems, hence, building resilience. They often provide low-cost solutions. There are also high-tech and innovative technological solutions which often need a large amount of funding and require more research, experience and training to be operated. Meanwhile, green measures result in nature-based solutions and ecosystem services to environmental problems. For instance, reforestation can stop desertification and recharge groundwater supplies in times of drought.  \nTypes of Adaptations to Environmental Changes\n1. Autonomous adaptation : It is an adaptation that does not constitute a conscious \nresponse to environmental change but is triggered by ecological changes in natural systems and by market or changes in ways of living in human systems. It is also referred to as spontaneous adaptation .\n2. Planned Adaptation: It is an adaptation that is the result of a deliberate policy \ndecision, based on an awareness that conditions have changed or are about to change and that action is required to return to, maintain, or achieve the desired state."

The Teso community members had various beliefs and practices related to both the dead and the living that had some links to the conservation of the environment. For instance, since ancient times, the community members believe that the dead and long buried relatives had their spirits continuously haunt the living family members to free them from the graves. Thus, to refuse these dead relatives, there was a common practice of exhuming (digging out) the remains of the dead from the graves that were at least ten years old for preservation. This ceremony that is locally known as Ekutet /Epunyas was carried out by a special group of elderly men and women from the community and was done in the absence of children and foreigners. Accordingly, once all the remains had been recovered from the grave, special baskets are used to transfer the bodies to some special central site where such remains were stored in places that are strictly protected.  Then, no human activity of any kind is carried out in such an area as it was believed that the spirits would attack anybody disturbing the peace of the dead. The area thus remained a very thick forest habiting a number of species or different organisms. Such sites and places were considered sacred and were thus protected from any internal or external interference thereby encouraging natural growth of the vegetation that later turned out to be dense forests that formed important habitats for a variety of flora and fauna. \nBesides, the Teso community members greatly recognized the importance of rivers, marshes \nand swamps as important dwellings places for ancestors and “God’s creatures” (biodiversity) since various species of plants and animals thrived in them. Thus, the conservation of water courses, streams, water pans and wells as well as the associated vegetation was protected through rules that ensured their sustainability. Again, reptiles such as snakes, frogs and toads that inhabited ponds, rivers and wells were protected from any harm due to the belief that they helped maintain / sustain the lives of these important water points. Also, the community members highly recognized and appreciated the importance of wells and rivers as crucial sources of water for livestock and human beings as well as a source of fish. Therefore, in order to conserve these resources, there were strong rules and beliefs that \nprotected such sites for many generations."

Especially, the sub-Saharan Africa – \nhaving recovered from the past stagnation, very rapid population growth was observed.  The trend in rapid population growth has far reaching implications. It affects economic development, employment, income distribution, poverty alleviation and social protections. It also affects efforts to ensure universal access to health care, education, housing, sanitation, water, food and energy. Therefore, to more sustainably address the needs of the society, policymakers must understand how many people are living in a country or region under consideration, where they are, and how old they are. \nThe rapid growth of the sub-Saharan African population is, in most countries, the \nresult of the late adoption of population policies and family planning programs, and the poor implementation of these programs in societies that remain largely pronatalist. \nMeanwhile, nature has provided human beings an opportunity with a sustainable \nand favorable environment.  However, humans have destroyed the perfect balance of the natural environment by over utilizing the resources around them or using the resources in unsustainable ways. Therefore, although human-environment interactions are inevitable for co-existence, maintaining a suitable balance is the key to survival. The impact of humans on the environment was understood differently at different times. Two important theories tried to explain humans. These theories were environmental possibilism and determinism.  The theories were put forth in order to comprehend and understand the role played by the physical environmental conditions in the emergence and progress of any human culture or society in a particular location.\nHumans highly depend on the environment, modify and adapt to changes in the \nenvironment. These human activities are basically to draw maximum benefit out of it and meet their needs. However, it disturbs the natural balance of the environment and causes the destruction. Avoiding the damage or reducing it is very crucial for the survival of human beings. In this regard, the accumulated indigenous knowledge of the African people is inevitable."

It involves \nthe corresponding decrease in the proportion of people living in rural areas. It also relates to the ways in which societies adapt to these situations. It is predominantly the process by which towns and cities are formed and become larger as more people \nbegin living and working in them.\nAs cities grow in population size, spatial extent and density, their environmental and \necological footprints increase (i.e., human impact on the environment increases). Urban expansion that takes place in forests, wetlands and agricultural systems leads to habitat clearing, degradation and fragmentation of the landscapes. Urban lifestyles, which tend to be consumptive, requiring great natural resources and generating increasing amounts of waste also lead to increased levels of air, water and soil pollution. Therefore, unplanned urbanization is the root cause of damage to the environment and nature.\nHowever, urbanization is by no means bad per se. It brings important benefits for \neconomic, cultural and societal development. Well managed cities are both efficient and effective, enabling economies of scale (the term “economies of scale” refers to the advantages that can sometimes occur as a result of increasing the size of a business). Furthermore, the proximity and diversity of people can spark innovation and create employment as exchanging ideas breeds new ideas."

For example, one of the main factors is rural-urban migration; which is driven by the prospect of greater employment opportunities and the hope of a better life in cities. A rapid increasing population density can create severe problems, especially if planning efforts are not sufficient to cope with the influx of new inhabitants. The result may, in extreme cases, be widespread poverty. Finally, unplanned urban expansion creates big slums, exacerbating socio-economic disparities and creates unhealthy or poor sanitary conditions that facilitate the spread of diseases.\nTo sum up, carefully considered urban planning and good governance with effective \nregulatory frameworks are required for rapid urbanization to provide opportunities to all.\n Unplanned Urbanization\nKey features of unplanned urbanization \nÞUrban sprawl and compactness\nÞUnplanned urban growth\nÞLand use change\nÞAccelerated poverty ÞEnvironmental degradation\nÞPoor air and water quality\nÞInsufficient water availability\nÞWaste-disposal problems\nFocus\n7.1.1 Causes of Unplanned Urbanization in Africa\nThough Africa is still largely rural, it is one of the fastest urbanizing continents in \nthe world.

Currently, the continent has seven megacities, that is cities with populations over 10 million: Cairo, Kinshasa, Lagos, Accra, Johannesburg–Pretoria, Khartoum, and Nairobi.\nDespite high rates of urban population growth, many African countries still have \na high degree of urban primacy. That is, one city - usually the capital, has the \npopulation, economic activity, and political power that are several times greater than the next largest city. Although Africa’s high urbanization rates make it similar to other rapidly urbanizing places in the world, it is important to underscore that the underlying processes that shape urbanization in Africa are vastly different from those experienced elsewhere.

Urbanization has a lot of effects on \nthe living conditions of the inhabitants. Some of the consequences of unplanned urbanization are discussed as follows:\n1. Development of Slums and Squatter Settlement\nWhen urbanization takes place as a result of a random and unexpected growth it leads to the spread of unlawful residential settlements represented by slums and squatters. The growth of slums and squatters in urban areas is even further exacerbated by fast-paced industrialization, lack of developed land for housing, large influx of rural immigrants  to the cities in search of better life, and very high prices of land beyond \nthe capability of the urban poor.\n2. Poor Infrastructure \nThe quality of city’s infrastructure  is central to the residents’ quality of life, social \ninclusion and economic opportunities. It also determines the city’s resilience  to a \nnumber of common risks such as economic, environmental, social and health-related \nrisks.

Economic Problem \nResidents in many urban centers in Africa face huge economic problems. The costs \nof housing, food and transportation is very high in the urban centers. In addition, in urban areas, unemployment rates are high and about 60 percent of jobs are in the informal or grey economy  which are neither taxed nor monitored by the government.\n4. Health Problem\nUrbanization creates opportunities but also exacerbates health risks, (e.g., obesity, \nrespiratory diseases, etc.). Moreover, large proportion of urban dwellers in Africa lack adequate sanitation and are exposed to high health risks. Such risks happen at a rapid speed hence it puts the capacity of the health sector to plan and adapt under big challenge. This is particularly true in Africa. Therefore, unplanned urbanization in combination with high population density, poverty and lack of infrastructure can have adverse effect on the health of residents by fostering conditions for communicable diseases."

The outcome has led to congestion, worsening air pollution, and a shortage of adequate housing, and other infrastructures. Ethiopia has experienced the fastest rates of urbanization, and one of the major challenges of urban development in the country has been spontaneously emerging settlements, which have contributed to the country’s increasing and unplanned urban growth trends. \nAddis Ababa, Ethiopia’s largest city, is a fast-growing city that is overwhelmed \nby many problems, including unplanned urban development and inefficient land uses, extensive urban poverty, joblessness, inadequate housing, congestion and underdeveloped infrastructure.\nHistorically, Addis Ababa was established from villages that evolved into major \nurban settlement without master plan. Informal settlement is at the heart of the genesis and development of the city of Addis Ababa. The informal settlements in Addis Ababa were spontaneously emerged and grown around the major centres of the city. The settlements lack basic municipal services such as water, sanitation, waste collection facilities that remain to be the hallmarks of such settlements. \nUnplanned and informal settlements in Addis Ababa are of two types. The first one \nis commonly known as the slums which are located in the highly congested areas marked by deteriorated infrastructure and unsanitary environment. The dwellings are also built out of substandard materials. Their physical characteristics is visible from the poorly planned settlements largely inhabited by low-income group. More than two-third of the population of the city are believed to be living in slum. The second type of unplanned urban settlement is the squatter settlement which denotes the settlements illegally built due to urbanization in an open space, farmland, steep slope, along river buffer and road sides without legal title deed particularly in the urban periphery. Such settlements in Addis Ababa city are characterized by low-quality housing, occupied by the poor.\nTherefore, the proliferation of informal settlement in Addis Ababa has negatively \naffected proper land use and adequate provision of municipal services. The unplanned development of such settlements has prohibited a planned development of the city and promoted spontaneous horizontal expansion of the city from time to time."

Undoubtedly the most frequent cause of coastal pollution problems is the discharge of municipal sewage and industrial wastes into coastal waters \nor into estuaries through low quality disposal facilities. If wastes contain persistent pollutants, discharge into rivers even at considerable distances upstream from the mouth can result in substantial quantities reaching the sea. The major classes of pollutant reaching coastal waters are decomposable organic materials, heavy metals and other toxic matter, dissolved and suspended non-toxic inorganic substances, and pathogenic organisms.\nMany factors such as dilution, temperature, adsorption, sedimentation and nutrient \ndeficiencies negatively affect self-purification of the sea. The marine environment is generally unfavorable to the survival of most pathogenic organisms. Under special circumstances, particularly in temperate and warm coastal waters near large cities, pathogenic agents may be found in marine waters in the proximity of the coastline and in estuaries.\nThe many people living in coastal zones, and even those located far inland, generate \nlarge quantities of wastes and other polluting substances that enter the seas directly or through coastal watersheds, rivers and precipitation from polluted air. Coastal pollution is rising rapidly as a result of population growth, urbanization, and industrial development along many coastal areas of Africa. Hence, its coastlines and marine protected areas of Africa are under a high degree of threat from industrial wastes.  The coastal marine environment is clearly being affected by the modification and destruction of habitats, over-fishing, and pollution. Many of these impacts can be traced back to land-based human activities located far from the sea.\nMany coastal waters carry excessive sediment and are contaminated by microbes and \norganic nutrients. Nitrogen, resulting from sewage discharges, agricultural and urban run-off, and atmospheric precipitation, is a common problem. The destruction of wetlands and mangroves, which act as natural filters for sediment, excessive nitrogen and wastes, has also accelerated nutrient buildup. Additional pollution sources are oil leaks and accidental spills from shipping, discharge of bilgewater, oil drilling and mineral extraction. Some persistent pollutants are even reaching deep ocean waters."

However, it should be recognized that rapid, often unplanned urbanization brings risks of profound social instability, risks to critical infrastructure, potential water crises and the potential for devastating spread of disease. \nAs the world continues to urbanize, power will increasingly be concentrated in cities. \nThis power – ranging from economic to social – not only makes cities the center of gravity, but offers greater scope to find practical solutions to the most pressing challenges. Indeed, many observers and organizations are now focusing on cities and the connections between them rather than directing their attention at the national level. The strength of city-level institutions and national institutions if they are capacitated to be flexible, innovative and dynamic, and effectively involve multiple stakeholders in governance they will largely determine whether urbanization makes the Africa more resilient or more vulnerable to face several risks and problems it poses. \nAs these risks are interconnected, a holistic view and approach are keys to mitigating \nthem. They can affect all of us in unpredictable ways, and they are our shared concerns. The risks should be carefully managed. The very first step to manage those risks is creating awareness – so it is necessary to highlight and discuss the challenge of interconnected risks on a broader level to ensure adequate levels of public awareness. Then, the next step is creating close contact between business, governments, communities, city councils, and academic institutions to bring effective solutions that will foster an environment where innovative public private partnerships can develop. Such partnership makes cities both efficient and resilient.\nMigration involves the movement of people leaving their place of birth for temporary \nor permanent change of residence. It may take the form of internal and international migration, resulting from push or pull factors through voluntary or forced decisions of the immigrants.\nAfrica’s coasts are being highly affected by coastal pollutions. In recent times, the \nproblem has become serious problem in recent times as a result of rising rapid population growth, urbanization and industrial development along many coastal \nareas of Africa."

Hence, the overall process of geospatial information and data processing depends on geographic data. The sources of the data could be from direct and remotely sensed sources. There are different types of tools or hardware that help us to collect data. The two most important tools include a global positioning system (GPS) and digitizers.\nThe geographic data gathered through the methods and tools mentioned above helps us \nto answer basic geographic questions such as ‘what is where?’, and ‘why is it there?’  Answering these questions helps us to identify risk areas and solve critical problems. \nThe result or the output of geographic data analysis can be a representation of data in \nnumeric values, displayed on maps, graphs, charts, and diagrams."

They both have specific meanings. \nI. Data \nData refer to different observations which are collected and stored as numbers, \ncharacters, images, facts and symbols.  They describe a feature, idea, status, or \nsituation that we want to focus on or are interested in. Therefore, data are sets of values of qualitative or quantitative variables about one or more persons or objects. \nData can be meaningful when it is further processed by human interpretations or input into a computer and the results disseminated.\nData has important lifecycles. It begins with data collection. At this stage  ,we may \ncollect new data (primary data) from a study area or existing secondary data obtained from different offices (e.g., Central Statistical Agency). The second stage in  the data lifecycle is data processing. This stage involves checking for data quality such as quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC), merging duplicate variables, and appending new information into the data. The third stage involves the analysis of data. Here different statistical analyses can be used to identify meaningful relationships between or amongst variables, and then the results can be displayed in tables, charts ,and graphs for visualization. \nThe final stage is  the \ndissemination of results. This \nstage involves sharing results  with the general public through conferences, workshops, and    publishing the results in known journals ,and archiving the results so that  they  can be accessible for future use.\n/gid00039/gid00072/gid00070/gid00084/gid00081/gid00068/gid00001/gid00025/gid00015/gid00018/gid00027 The Data Cycle"

Geospatial data typically \ncombines location information (usually coordinates on the earth) and attribute \ninformation (the characteristics of the object, event or phenomena concerned) with temporal information (the time at which the location and attributes existed). \nGeographical data links place, time, and attributes. Geographical data is at the \nheart of map making. Without geographical data  events, or phenomena of an area of \nour interest (AOI) cannot be visualized and analyzed.\nA. Place\nPlace or location is essential in the collection of geographical data. Locations are the \nbasis for mapping an area of our interest. Based on the location we can link different kinds of information to it, and measure distances and areas. Without locations, data are said to be “ aspatial” or or non-spatial, and have no value at all.  \nB. Time\nTime is an optional element. Many aspects of the earth’s surface are slow to change and can be thought of as unchanging. For example, height above sea level changes slowly because of erosion and movements of the earth’s crust, but these processes"

On the other hand, temperature changes daily and dramatic changes sometimes occur in minutes with the passage of a cold front or thunderstorm, so time is very important.\nC. Attributes\nAttributes refer to descriptive information about the objects, events or phenomena that we try to map. There is a lot of attribute information an area may have. Some attributes are physical or environmental (e.g., temperature or elevation), while \nothers are social or economic (e.g., number of populations, or income). \n8.1.3 Visualizing Geographic Data\nThere are two fundamental ways of visualizing geographic data. It can be visualized as a discrete object or as continuous data. \nA. Discrete objects represent an area as objects with well-defined boundaries in \nopen space. Hence, a discrete object has known and definable boundaries. It is easy \nto define precisely where the object begins and where it ends. For example, a lake is a discrete object within the surrounding landscape. \n/gid00039/gid00072/gid00070/gid00084/gid00081/gid00068/gid00001/gid00025/gid00015/gid00019/gid00027 An Example of Discreet Object – Lake \nB. Continuous data represents areas or phenomena that progressively vary across \na surface or a location. The values of a measure of variables may vary from point to point. Continuous data is also referred to as field, non-discrete, or surface data."

It \nis believed that the human activity of graphically representing one’s perception of the world is a universally acquired skill and one that pre-dates virtually all other forms of written communication. From cave paintings to ancient maps of Babylon, Greece, and Asia, right into the 21\nst century, people have created and used maps as an \nessential tool to help them define, explain and navigate their way through the world. \nMapping represented a significant step forward in the intellectual development of \nhuman beings and it serves as a record of the advancement of knowledge of the human race, which could be passed from members of one generation to those that follow in the development of culture.\nEarly maps were a garbled or distorted mass of land that bear no resemblance to the \nactual world. As the centuries passed, maps became larger, more detailed and more accurate. \nSeveral technical advances since the 18\nth Century helped mapmakers to accurately \ndraw the general outline of the continents and locate their precise positions. The \nadvances in mathematics and astronomy and dividing the Earth into lines of longitude and latitude were among the most notable advances. \nThere has been an ever increasing demand for maps and greater reliability on maps \nin the 21\nst Century. Specially, improvements in printing and photography, the mass \nproduction of maps and the ability to make accurate reproductions from more accurate data, as well as, the availability of airplanes and satellites made it possible to photograph and provide images of large areas at a time.

Such a process \nis very important to analyze and understand socioeconomic and environmental problems. The solutions to these problems require spatial thinking and geographic data analysis. Therefore, geographical data is the basis to provide answers to the problems. \nData can represent all types of information and may consist of numbers, text, images \nand many other formats. A wide variety of data sources exist for both spatial and attribute data. Some geographic phenomenon is well placed in discrete object while \nother phenomenon is well placed in continuous field.\nSpatial data is collected in many different ways. The oldest method is the ground \nsurvey . The dimensions of geographic features are measured, such as length, size \nand direction by surveying equipment. These days, those surveying equipment have \nbeen increasingly replaced with GPS. Other methods are remote sensing. Remote sensing allows for collecting spatial data without direct contact with the object of our interest. \nDigital technology has driven the need for putting reality into the computer. In other \nwords, human conceptualization or representation of geographic data largely depend on digital format. Hence, data structure can be seen as the digital representation of an area of our interest which the computer can understand. For example, lines are stored as a set of points where points have x, y coordinates. Areas or polygons by connected lines. The shapes could appear in a vector or raster formats. \nMoreover, geographic representation in a digital form is becoming increasingly \nimportant in our world today. Digital representations have enormous advantages over paper maps, written reports, or spoken accounts.  As a result of this and other advances in technology during the last few decades more sophisticated mapping systems came into existence. Particularly, the advancement of geographic information system (GIS) played a great role in the improvements of mapping. The geographic information system is a computer-based system that enables us to store, visualize, analyze, and interpret geographic data. \nDeveloping technical skills such as making graphs, charts and diagrams are very \nimportant. Because, many studies, researches and textbooks use data and numbers. Hence, presentations using these tools can help the presenter draw and keep the attention of the listeners. Presentation using graphs, charts and diagrams also helps the presenter to have a profound evidence-based work."
