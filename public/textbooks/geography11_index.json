According to this theory, the Universe originated sometime 10–20 billion years ago by an abrupt cosmic explosion initiated by the expansion of a small volume of matter at an exceedingly high density and temperature.  This space explosion was then followed by the formation of numerous space objects like the Sun, planets (Figure 1.1), stars, meteors, asteroids, and comets through material collision, cooling, and gravitational attraction. Our Earth was thus created from the mixture of gas and dust particles moving in space around the Sun about 4.5 billion years ago.\nFigure 1.1 The Solar System (Sun & Planets) [Wicander & Monroe, 2010]\nBrainstorming Activity  1.2\nDiscuss the questions below with your classmates and \nteacher:\n1.

Next to this four major continents (Gondwana, Baltica, Siberia & Laurasia) came into being during 458 Ma (in the mid-Ordovician Period). Then the Laurasia continent collided with the Baltica and closed the Iapetus Sea during the mid-Silurian (425 Ma). \nThe continual collision had then produced the pre-Pangaea continent during the early \nDevonian period, at about 390 Ma. At about 306 Ma (in the late Carboniferous period) the North American continent started to develop from the assemblage of rocks. By then, the Supercontinent (Pangaea) had come into being at about 255 -210 Ma. From 210 -180 Ma (in the Triassic period) this Supercontinent started to break apart. The break-up had continued until the late Cretaceous. In the meantime, North America had moved away from the African continent. During the late Cretaceous, the breaking-apart of Pangaea widened and bigger water masses (Oceans) were created along the continental cracks. Finally, continental break-up progressively continued during the Tertiary period; the Earth’s continents have then retained their present position during the Quaternary (Figure 1.3)."

At about 160 Ma, Pangaea divided into two bigger landmasses called Gondwanaland and Laurasia by the process of continental drift. The landmass that developed into sub-continent India moved northwards and separated from the Gondwana continent at about 1 40 Ma. This occasion caused the collision of the Indian sub-continent with Eurasia and initiated the formation of the Himalayas ranges. Some 100 Ma, Australia had separated from Antarctica and this has pronounced the break-up of the Gondwana continent. The two giant continents (Gondwanaland & Laurasia), then moved-apart east and west thereby resulting in the opening of the Atlantic Ocean."

Relative and Absolute Age of Rocks\nRelative age mainly depends on the analysis of the sequence of geological occurrences without \ngiving due regard to the exact time of origin. It focuses only on determining the sequence of formation of events (whether the event had occurred before or later than the other related one). This method principally depends on the study of sedimentary rocks and often applies to local conditions interpretations. Geologists employ three basic principles (rules) during the study of the relative age of rocks:\nThe principle of original horizontality indicates that layers of sediments are originally placed horizontally under the action of gravity. This means that except for the disturbed sequences, sedimentary rocks are always deposited in nearly horizontal beds. In the hypothetical Figure 1.4a,the rock-layers A, B & C must have been developed in horizontal beds because they have thesame orientation. If the beds are no longer horizontal, they must have undergone deformationafter formation. The principle of superposition asserts that in an undisturbed sequence of sedimentary rock layers (beds) or lava flows, the overlying bed is younger than the underlyingrock. For instance, in Figure 1.4b, the rock layers are placed from earliest (1) to latest (4).\nFigure 1.4: Sample sedimentary rock-layers\nThe principle of cross-cutting relationships indicates that a rock-layer that cross-cuts anotherrock-layer is said to be younger than the rocks it cross-cuts. This is a condition where olderrocks are cut by younger geologic features or igneous intrusions. In Figure 1.4c, layer 3 is anigneous intrusion created after the formation of the sedimentary layers 1 and 2.\nA) Original Horizontality          B) Superposition                 C) Cross-Cutting Source: www.kean."

The Hadean, Archean and Proterozoic Eons are often called Precambrian by scientists to refer to the geological time before the emergence of life on Earth. The Phanerozoic is the most recent Eon.

It covers the time from 600 million to 4.5 billion years (about 85% of the geological time of the Earth). It was the time of solidification of the Earth and the formation of the oldest rocks. Rocks created during that time are rich in base metallic minerals and are often called crystalline basement complex rocks.

The Devonian, the fourth period of the Paleozoic, was rich in fish species and referred to as the age of fish. By the end of the Paleozoic, all continents of the Earth had joined together and created the Supercontinent named Pangaea (Figure 1.9). The creation of Pangaea led to extreme seasonal weather changes that caused the great extinction of Earth species. Due to that, around 75% of the Amphibian species have perished.\nFigure 1.9 The Supercontinent (Pangaea) (Gabler et al., 2007)\nThe Mesozoic era marked the time from 250-70 Ma. It is often referred to as the era of middle \nlife and the age of Dinosaurs owing to their relative dominance. Turtles, snakes, crocodiles, and lizards were among the life forms of the time.

Tropical areas were dominated by extensive swamps which later became rich coal deposits. The mid-Mesozoic era was experiencing the splitting of Pangaea into Laurasia and Gondwanaland (Figure 1.9). Igneous activities had initiated also the development of volcanic mountain ranges in western North America. The end of the Mesozoic era saw the emergence of land mammals but marked the mass extinction of Dinosaurs (see Figure 1.8).\nThe Cenozoic era is the recent one covering the time since 70 Ma.  As it forms the recent \ngeologic time, it is well known compared to the other Geological eras. Birds, mammals, and flowering plants dominante succeeded on Earth. It is commonly named an era of recent life and the age of mammals."

All water (hydrosphere) in total covers greater than 7 1% of Earth’s \nsurface. The largest of these are the Oceans, which account for over 97% of all the water on \nEarth. Glaciers and polar ice caps contain just greater than 2% of the Earth’s water in the form of solid ice. Only about 0.6% is found under the surface as groundwater. Nevertheless, groundwater is 36 times more plentiful than water found in lakes, inland Seas, rivers, and in the atmosphere as water vapor.\nThe distribution of Ocean basins and Continents is unevenly arranged over the Earth’s surface \n(see Figure 1.10). In the Northern Hemisphere, the ratio of land to ocean is about 1:1.5. But it is 1:4 in the Southern Hemisphere. The greater abundance of water in the Southern Hemisphere has some interesting effects on the environment of that area. For example, the climate tends to be more moderate in the Southern Hemisphere because of the ocean’s ability to release large amounts of stored heat energy.\nThe Continents\nA continent is a huge area of land mostly separate by a water body. There are seven known continents on the earth today. They are: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. A brief description of the continents is presented as follows:This topic of unit one is about the relative size and distribution of the Continental landmasses and Oceanic basins over the Globe.

Due to plate movement (tectonics) the position of continents and oceans has been changing several times. For instance, during the Triassic period of the Mesozoic era (\n210 \nMa), the earth’s continents were joined together forming one big continent called Pangaea (meaning the whole of the earth). Pangaea during this time was surrounded by on big water body named Panthalasu. During this time, Laurasia was located around the equator whereas Gondawana was located around the South-Pole.\nDuring the second stage, in the late Triassic period (\n180Ma), Pangaea started cracking because \nof continental drift. Following the rifting of Pangaea, Laurasia moved to the north. Africa, \nSouth America, India and Arabia started moving to the north too. Antarctica and Australia positioned around the South-Pole. Following the cracking of Pangaea, the oceans flooded the rifted area between the continents (see Figure 1.3). \nDuring the late cretaceous (65 Ma), the separation between Eurasia and North America \nincreased. These two big continents positioned almost north of the tropic of cancer. Africa, South America, Arabia and India separated and positioned around the equator.

Since the cracks between the separating continents widened, all the free areas were occupied by the Pacific, Atlantic, Arctic and southern oceans. \nAfter the separation of the Pangaea (see Figures 1.9 &1.12), North America and Eurasia are \npositioned in the northern hemisphere while India and Arabia joined Eurasia.

It is established by Earth scientists through observation and analysis of rock layers. Two types of rock dating methods (Relative and Absolute dating) are used during rock dating activities. In relative dating, three principles (Original horizontality, Superposition, and Cross-cutting relationships) are in use. Radiometric isotopic dating methods are used for determining the absolute ages of rocks. \nThe Earth is estimated to be 4.5 billion years old. The earliest life-forms assessed from fossilized \nbacteria are detected to be only about 3.5 billion years old.  Scientists guess that early Earth was very hot and hostile to life. Its history is classified into Eons, Eras, Periods, and Epochs. Eons cover longer time units (billions of years) in the geological timescale. They are the Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic. The Phanerozoic Eon is the latest and divided into four Eras. Eras cover larger time units (hundreds of Ma). They include the Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras. The eras are further classified into periods that cover millions of years. They are 13 in number and each divided into relatively shorter periods named epochs. Of the eras, the longest and oldest is the Precambrian. It is the time when the earliest rocks solidified and were created. The Paleozoic is known to be the age of ancient life. The Mesozoic marks the age of middle life in the geological history of the Earth. The Cenozoic is the latest and is an era of developed mammals, birds, and modern humans.\nThe formation of the Earth is attributed similar to the creation of other companion planets \nand the entire Solar System. The present-day continents are assumed to be developed by continental drift. At the beginning (during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras) all current continents were joined together forming a big landmass (Pangaea) embraced by a big water body named Panthalasu. In the mid of the Mesozoic, Pangaea started to break apart to form two major continents named Gondwanaland and Laurasia. These two supercontinents later split into several smaller landmasses.\nDue to continental drift, the Earth and its continents as well as the ocean basins have been \ncontinuously changing their shape, size, and position since the time of their creation. Their distribution has also been changing since time immemorial. For instance, the Supercontinent Pangaea was situated around the South Pole during the late Permian. Eurasia was also centered around the equator during that time. The present-day Oceans were not known by then.  Today a large part of the continental landmass is located north of the equator. On the other hand, Oceanic environments are much more in the southern hemisphere. The proportion of land and water is not also equal over the planet Earth. Large areas (>7 1% of the Earth) are covered by water. Generally, the Earth’s continents and Oceans are not permanent and static. Their shapes, sizes, and locations are continuously changing with changes in time and earth processes.  UNIT SUMMARY"

Climates are classified using a genetic classification method based only on the major forcing processes that shape climate. Climate is classified using the genetic method based on the activity and features of air masses, circulation systems, fronts, jet streams, solar radiation, topographic effects, and other factors that contribute to the spatial and temporal patterns of climatic data. Genetic systems, while more scientifically desirable, are more complex to implement and less successful overall since they do not rely on simple observation. The most widely utilized genetic systems are air mass ideas. \nThe empirical classification system is a classification system that uses data input to calculate \nthe climatic type based on specified class boundaries. Köppen and Trewartha’s systems, for example, have the advantage of being simple to deploy in regions with high-quality and abundant climatic data. They also make certain that two places with similar climatic characteristics for the variables in question are grouped. \nThe classical period of climatic analysis began in 1970 with the mathematics and distribution \nof natural vegetation based on the botanist Vladimir Köppen’s climatic classification system. For world climate classification, the Köppen method typically includes yearly and monthly temperature and precipitation, as well as the seasonality of those variables. Winds, temperature extremes, precipitation intensity, sunshine quantity, cloud cover, and net radiation are not considered in Köppen’s climatic classification system. \nTrewartha’s classification incorporates the fundamentals of both empirical and genetic \nclassification schemes.

Köppen published his initial climate classification scheme in 1900 and revised it in 1940.\nBased on the aforementioned criteria, the Köppen system distinguishes between five major \nterrestrial climatic types: 1. Tropical climate (A): All months have an average temperature above 18\no C (64oF). There \nis no real winter season because every month of the year remains warm.2. Dry Climate (B): It has deficient precipitation most of the year.Keywords:\nClimate classification\nModified Köppen\nSimplified Köppen"

Aridity is defined by Köppen in terms of the temperature-precipitation index, with evaporation thought to be controlled by temperature.

It has high daily temperatures ranging from 20 to 30\n0C, and monthly temperatures \nranging from 24 to 280C, with consistent precipitation throughout the year (over 80 inches \nof total rainfall). The region’s vegetation is dominated by rainforests, which are dense, tall, broad-leafed, and evergreen trees. In the afternoons of practically every day, high surface heat, marine humidity, and convergence result in cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud forms and thunderstorms. The sun warms the ground and the air above it. Warm air rises in convection currents as it becomes lighter. The elevated air expands, cools, and condenses into white cumulus or cumulonimbus storm clouds, which ultimately produce conventional rainfall.The world's climatic zones have been divided into three broad climate groups based on the \nKöppen classification and seasonal dominance of air masses.

Summer is dominated \nby continental tropical air masses, whereas winter is dominated by continental polar air masses. Low relative humidity and cloud cover, low frequency and volume of precipitation, and moderate to high average monthly temperature characterize the climate of the region. The main source of precipitation is moisture from maritime sources. Because of the rain shadow effect, the presence of mountains upwind of these climates might further restrict moisture availability. Mountain ranges to the west and south restrict ocean air masses, allowing polar air masses to prevail throughout the winter months.\nThe east of the Caspian Sea, the north of the Himalayas, the western United States, and the \neast of the Andes are the key areas influenced by mid-latitude deserts.

Mid-latitude temperatures have a wider range of daily annual temperatures than their subtropical counterparts.

Latitude (Seasonality)At the end of this section, you will be able to:\nidentify the factors responsible for the formation of world climatic regions, and\nvisualize the impact of several factors on the formation of global climate zones.2.5. FACTORS INFLUENCING THE WORLD CLIMATIC REGIONS\nThe global climate distribution looks to be jumbled, with comparable climatic conditions \noccurring in widely dispersed locations of the globe. Climate controls are the elements that influence the climate in any given location. The amount of sunlight and its variation with lati -\ntude, the distribution of land and water, ocean currents, prevailing winds, the position of high and low-pressure zones, mountain barriers, and height are all factors that influence a region’s climate.  \n      Why does latitude have anything to do with climate?Brainstorming Activity 2.6 \nOn any given day, solar energy insolation strikes the earth at a decreasing angle from 900\n(direct overhead) to 00 (where the sun is on the horizon). Above the horizon, when the sun’s \nangle is lower, there is less intense insolation (i.e. closer to 00). This is because when solar rays \nreach a high latitude region, low angle earth, they are attenuated and depleted more efficiently \nby colliding with more air particles. Solar rays flow through the atmosphere most efficiently when the sun is directly overhead (i.e., at a 90\n0 sun angle) at equatorial locations because they \nreach the surface perpendicular to it and have fewer opportunities to be attenuated. \nEvery day, 12 hours of bright sunlight will be experienced in the low latitude zone (equatorial \nlocales), providing more time for the surface to heat up and resulting in little seasonal change. On the other side, high latitude regions (arctic/polar locations) have highly distinct seasons, with cool summers and relatively long days. Winters are bitterly cold, and the nights are long. The change in solar declination and day duration is explained by the shifting relationships between the earth’s surface and the sun over the year. Seasonal variations in the sun’s angle and the amount of daylight can thus be considered the most fundamental elements influencing global temperature dispersion.Keywords:\nAtmospheric Circulation\nContinentality\nCentrifugal\nElevation  Latitude\nOcean Circulation\nSubtropical High Pressure"

This means one location may be affected by atmospheric circulation from a certain direction more often than another. \nFigure 2.7: Global atmospheric circulation Lakes, swamps, and marshes, for example, can generate significant temperature variations. \nWindward (upwind) locations of the lake see more dramatic temperature changes than leeward locations (downwind).Insolation at the water or land surface also adds to temperature variation.

            "text": "Climate Classification and Regions of the World \nClimatologists divide climatic regions to simplify and summarize the concept of a diverse range \nof climates. The ancient Greeks categorized our world into three zones based on habitability: Frigid Zone, Temperate Zone, and Torrid Zone. Because of its strong alignment to vegetation and soil domains, Köppen’s classification system has become the most extensively utilized system in modern times. The primary parameters for classifying the global climate are natural vegetation, temperature, and precipitation. Most vegetation types respond immediately to climate inputs, particularly temperature and moisture, according to the Köppen system, which is based on dominating vegetation types. The link between flower types and their properties is used to classify climates. The Köppen system classifies five primary terrestrial climate types based on these criteria: A (tropical or megatherms), B (xerophytes or Arid), C (mesothermal or mid-latitude mild), D (micro-thermal or mid-latitude cold), and E (micro-thermal or mid-latitude cold) (hekistotherms, polar).\nCombining the required first, second and third-order subdivisions yields the modified \nKöppen–Geiger climatic categories. To describe regional climate more precisely, those primary (first) climatic types are further categorized into second and third-order subcategories. The Köppen approach is more appealing to geographers since it identifies the relationship between vegetation types and climatic types. Some of the scheme’s flaws include its failure to account for essential meteorological elements like precipitation intensity, cloudiness, and the number of rainy days, as well as daily temperature extremes, air masses, and winds.Trewartha developed a simple climatic categorization technique that included empirical and genetic classification schemes. It determines the climatic type of a location just based on precipitation and temperature, avoiding complex statistical and mathematical calculations. Because of its simplicity, Trewartha’s scheme grew more popular among geographers. Trewartha established six broad first-order climatic types at the global level and labeled them A, B, C, D, E, and F climates.\nThe key elements that govern the distribution of world climate include latitude (seasonality); \nthe combined effect of revolution, rotation, and tilt; continentally; atmospheric circulation; seasonal movement of subtropical high pressure; coriolis effect; ocean circulation; and elevation. Ethiopia’s local climate classification is based on height, temperature, and growing season length. The country is divided into five primary climatic zones: Bereha, Kola, Woina Dega, Dega, and Wurch, according to the climatic system.UNIT SUMMARY"

It is the source of all wealth; both a physical commodity and an abstract concept that the rights to own or use it are as much a part of the land as the object rooted in the soil. From the land, we obtain food, shelter, space to work, and room to relax. Land again represents fundamental components of the ecosystem. Land as a resource, therefore, incorporates the natural resources (often referred to as land resources) and is viewed also as an environment.Keywords: \nLand,\nLand management \nNatural resourcesNon-renewable resources\nRenewable resources"

Brainstorming Activity 3.1 \nLand resources are useable materials that are often occurring naturally in the environment. \nThey are derived from the Earth: from Lithosphere, Biosphere, Atmosphere, or Hydrosphere. They are classified into different groups based on different parameters. For instance, based on:\nRegeneration: renewable and non-renewable resources,\nOrigin: biotic and abiotic resources,\nCurrent use and future availability: stock and flow resources,\nDistribution and volume: ubiquitous, unique, common, and rare resources, \nStage of development: potential, actual and conditional resources.\nRenewable resources such as plants and animals are often regenerative and replaceable after use. These resources go on replacing themselves as far as the rate of use is less than the rate of regeneration and as long as their environments are well kept. Renewable resources can be replenished or reproduced easily. They are resources that grow again and again or come back again after use. The rate of regeneration differs from resource to resource. For instance, crops take a short time to regenerate. Resources like soil on the other hand may take a relatively long time to renew. Forest resources can take a longer time compared to others. Nevertheless, many renewable resources can be depleted through excessive use. Being classified as a renewable resource does always mean not depleting at all. If excessively used, they can be easily depleted (exhausted). Sustainable (wise) use of such resources is thus the basic requirement for preserving land resources for the benefit of humankind. Some of the renewable resources are inexhaustible–exist as flow chattels (e.g. sunlight, oxygen in the atmosphere, wind, etc.).\nNon-renewable resources exist in a finite supply and do not replace themselves after use. \nThey diminish in size and quality with excessive use. These resources do not come back after use or would take a very long time to regenerate. Minerals and fossil fuels are the best examples of these resource groups. The rate of formation of these resources is very slow; hence, they cannot be replenished soon once they get depleted. As it is difficult to get back these resources, recycling and reusing are among the recommended management options. Reuse involves using a resource over and over again in the same form or after recycling it. Nonetheless, resources like coal and petroleum cannot be recycled like metallic minerals. Therefore, it is essential to carefully manage the use of non-renewable resources because their unmanaged use may lead to rapid exhaustion which finally restricts the benefit of coming generations."

For that land should be managed to provide a wide range of services including the making of food and fiber.  It has to deliver distinctive landscape opportunities for outdoor public recreation as well as pivotal ecological functions. The management of land has essentially to encompass the protection of wider landscapes and resources (mountains, hills, rivers, depressions, water, air, vegetation, wildlife, etc.) to retain sustained public benefits and ecosystem services. It thus has to reflect the principles of sustainable resource use and development. For that, it has to build upon national, regional, and local needs and aspirations. The prime objective of land management is to control land degradation to balance resource exploitation and regeneration. \nAs land management is materialized through the protection of its resources, it has to base \nitself on the management of soil, water, natural vegetation, and air. For instance, proper farming practices, tree planting (afforestation and reforestation), controlled grazing, terracing, and check-damming can be used to protect soils, water, and forests. Adaptation of fuel-saving technologies in vehicles; use of renewable power sources (e.g. hydropower) for industrial and home energy requirements help to reduce environmental pollution.

The main forms of soil degradation (depletion) are\nPhysical (crusting, compaction, depth reduction),\nChemical(salinization, alkalinisation, acidification), and\nBiological (loss of soil biota, decline of soil organic carbon).\nYet, the depletion of soils reduces their productive capacity and environmental quality. Soil depletion likewise annihilates the essential ecosystem functions in the soil system. But still, the mentioned problems have solutions. They can be managed through proper utilization; by the adoption of erosion control structures; and through the addition of manure and natural fertilizers.\nFigure 3.1 Degradation of land resources at global scales (pasture, crop, and other land uses)\nGlobal Assessment of Human-induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD, 1990 in Haile et al. 2006)"

It is essential for the generation and growth of plants. It forms also the major components of soil formation, rock weathering, organic matter decomposition, and rainfall formation. Water (mainly freshwater) forms the essential portion of the environment and serves as a habitat for diverse life forms. In addition, its service for the production of power is so great.  Nonetheless, it is enclosed by a far greater number of constraints than ever before.  With the commencement of the 21st century, the world’s freshwater resources fall under great pressure from more different directions than ever before in the Earth’s history. \nFreshwater stands by now among the land resources that suffer a lot from excessive human \npressure. Rivers and lakes are among those extremely threatened by domestic and industrial wastes. Particularly those found closer to urban areas are polluted by plastic bags, and exotic water plants like the water hyacinth. Oil spills (leakages) from steamships/boats plus chemicals released from industries entering the lakes, seas, and rivers cause excessive accumulation of nutrients and toxicity over the animals inhabiting those hydrologic ecosystems. \nDue to the spectacular rising populations, water scarcities and effluence of the sources are \nresulting in turbulence. The scarcity of water is currently distressing in many arid and semiarid areas of the world where population pressure is somewhat extensive including parts of the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. \nFigure 3.2 Soil erosion at global scales (Li & Fang, 2016; in IPCC, 2019)"

Throughout the history of humankind, forests have been essential for the well-being of people and presently donate much to the livelihoods of billions of populations worldwide. They particularly provide subsistence items, income, and agricultural inputs to the livelihoods of many households. Forest ecosystems in addition donate a wide range of services like climate stabilization, flood control, waste filtration, and soil erosion control at local, regional, and global scales. They also uptake and store the world’s carbon stocks and serve as heat and waste sequestration. Forest resources again serve as a habitat for the Earth’s known terrestrial species. Nevertheless, deforestation (excessive tree cutting), encroachment of farming into the communal forest areas, and mismanagement largely reduce their services despite the enormous benefits that they provide.About 13 million ha of forested lands have been annually converted into other land uses due to natural causes at the global level over the past few decades.  Forest clearance for large-scale plantation agriculture and livestock ranching in the tropics (e.g. in the Amazon basin) resulted in the loss of rainforest ecosystems. Increasing demand for biofuels, mining, rapid urbanization, climate change, changes in consumption patterns, and human values and ethics due to the rapid increase of world population and world trade (globalization) have been creating additional pressure on the status of world forests. \nPlease read about the current and future influence of high \npopulation growth on resource use and management from books or intent sources and share the information you get with your classmates.

Worldwide, more than 263 transnational river and lake channels plus numerous trans-state aquifers are currently known to geographers. These 263 transnational watercourses make up around 60% of the world’s freshwater flows and nearly one-half of the Earth’s terrestrial surface. They pass across the terrains of 1 45 nations and support about 40% of the global population.

Inter-state collaborations and partnerships are the best options to address diverging interests over shared river basins. Nevertheless, shared watercourses appear to be sources of conflict and dialogue among countries despite their implanting potential for cooperation like that of Ethiopia and Egypt over the use of the Nile waters.Around 80% of the total area of 44 countries lies within international basins.

But, for rational thinkers conflicts and wars will never benefit riparian states. They rather can benefit more through inter-state formal cooperation. National, regional, or international institutions (organizations) are thus considered basic components for alleviation of potential disputes arising from the use of shared watercourses.\nResearch shows that there are nowadays plenty of institutions and treaties focusing on the \nrights, responsibilities, and duties of countries sharing specific international watercourses. There are many bilateral and multilateral examples of this in different parts of the world. Of the 263 shared basins of the world, 17 6 (67%) had bilateral conventions. Nevertheless, 79% of the covenants of the past were in watercourses crossing three or more riparian countries. Most joint covenants from multilateral basins were also bilateral types (2:1). This indicates that many of the agreements were intentionally excluding one or more riparian countries within a given catchment. Examples of such institutions are provided in the coming paragraphs. \nThe Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) :  was a pact created to coordinate Nile basin resource \nmanagement and socio-economic development in the riparian states. It was initiated in \nDecember 1992 with the creation of a Technical Cooperation Committee for the Promotion of Development and Environmental Protection of the Nile Basin (TECCONILE).  It was first initiated by six Nile River riparian states (Egypt, Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania & Zaire). Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea, and Burundi were observers at the initial time. Between 1997 and 2001, considerable progress was made in designing structures and institutions for a new regime in the basin. Then the TECCONILE was replaced by the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) in I999 at Waterbury in 2002; with Ethiopia joining as a full member.The NBI was first signed by Ministers of Water Resources of riparian states on 22 February 1999 in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania.  The main objective of the multilateral pact was to promote:\nSustainable socioeconomic development in the basin states,\nEquitable utilization and benefit of the basin resources,\nRecognition of the rights of all riparian states, and\nNile Task – to prepare an inclusive legal Framework for equitable and sustainable allocation of Nile waters and resources.\nThe Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA): This water-focused organization \nwas created by Lesotho and the RSA by signing the treaty in 1986. The project aimed to \nundertake a project to transfer water from the head-reaches of the Orange River to the key industrial areas of the RSA in the Pretoria-Witwatersrand Vereeniging region."

They are crucial for both people and animals.  Some examples of natural resources include water, air, land, forests, fish, wildlife, topsoil, and minerals. Access to such natural resources partly decides the wealth and prestige of people and even the position of countries in the international economic system. Some of the aforesaid natural resources are exhaustible with excessive utilization. Resources like diamonds, minerals, and natural oil are available in limited amounts and can be exhausted with use. The market value of such resources rises when their quantities shrink. When the size of natural resources shrinks, asset scarcity occurs. The shortage then triggers conflict among the resource users – what is commonly called ‘Natural Resource Conflict’. This topic thus focuses on conflicts rising from resources. this lesson you thus will be able to:\nexamine the causes of resource conflict,\ndescribe the consequences of resource conflict,\nexplain conflict resolving methods.\nKeywords: \nArbitration\nCauses\nConsequences\nResource conflict\nNegotiation\n1. What is natural resource conflict? \n2. What are the causes and consequences? Please discuss in groups and tell your answer to your teacher.Brainstorming Activity 3.9 \nResource conflicts are disputes arising over accessing, controlling, and using materials found in nature. Such conflicts often emerge because people use resources such as forests, water, pastures, and land. Disputes also arise when the interests and needs of users are not met or when the priorities of some user groups are not considered by governments. Such conflicts of interest are inevitable features of all societies. In recent years, the scope and magnitude of natural resource conflicts have increased and intensified."

Disputes over resources as part of new national laws and conventions (i.e. in the context of a peace agreement or new constitution); \nc.

Such disputes trigger violence and devastation, principally in countries with weak administration, high levels of corruption, and experiencing fierce ethnic and political divisions. Some 40–60 % of the civil wars during the past six de -\ncades have been instigated by the control and use of natural resources. Although grievances over the usage of shared resources cause fierce competition among people and countries, they may be markers of change and progress for many reasons; if handled properly and peacefully. Typical examples of conflicts that originated from the seizure and use of natural resources are presented in the proceeding paragraphs."

Ownership of land provides the chance to access minerals, timber, animals, pasture, and farm plots, plus many other resources. People often have strong ‘emotional and symbolic attachments to land and the resources on it’. Land often holds high economic value and socio-cultural prestige. But, due to population growth and environmental degradation, lands that can be used for personal, industrial, or agricultural purposes are becoming increasingly scarce and then initiate conflict among people or coun -\ntries. Customarily, most wars have been fought for the control of lands: Example: \nEcuador and Peru have fought several wars over their disputed border,\nRecently, violent conflict over land has occurred in China, East Timor, Kosovo, Rwanda, and Tajikistan, \nBorder conflicts and wars were waged between Ethiopia and Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia, \nThere are still border conflicts between India and Pakistan (over Kashmir); Ethiopia and Sudan, and many other countries.\nTimber increasingly gets scarce with mounting populations. Today, 46% of the 30% of world forest cover has been destroyed. Population growth and industrialization are destroying rainforests and causing environmental degradation.

Plants and animals of the biosphere, gases of the atmosphere, the underlying geology and soils as well as the hydrology, plus the results of past and present activities of human beings are attributes of land or considered to be part of the land.\nThe useable resources of the land are dwindling with excessive use owing to the rapidly \ngrowing populations. Managing the depleting resources like soil, forest, and water and properly using non-renewable materials thus becomes mandatory.\nThere are more than 263 transnational river and lake channels plus numerous trans-state \naquifers in the world. These 263 transnational watercourses make up around 60% of the world’s freshwater flows and litter nearly one-half of the Earth’s terrestrial surface. They pass across the terrains of 1 45 nations and support about 40% of the global population. About 60% of the space of Africa and South America and nearly 40% of North and Central America falls under inter-state Rivers. Around 80% of the total area of 44 countries lies within international basins. Twenty of these 44 countries are found in Africa, 13 in Europe, seven in Asia, and four in Latin America. The entire area of 30 countries as a whole falls within the trans-state waters. Groundwaters interlinked with 300 transboundary aquifers also support nearly two million people around the world. \nEthiopia, Sudan, and Egypt share the waters of the Nile. Over 85% of the Nile water flows \nfrom Ethiopia. But, Sudan and Egypt nowadays challenge the construction of the GERD saying that it might affect their water supply. They often argue Ethiopia should abide by the 1959 agreement signed by the two countries. The mentioned covenant did not allow water to Ethiopia. 58.5 BCM of water was allotted to Egypt while 18.5 BCM was provided to Sudan. The rest was left for losses from evaporation and seepage. Ethiopia will never be forced to accept the treaty signed in her absence. Similarly, the right of Ethiopia was deliberately overlooked in the 1959 treaty. Therefore, there are contentions between the three countries on the use and development of the Nile water.\nNatural resource conflicts often occur over the control, ownership, and use of land, timber \nfreshwater, minerals, energy, and hydrocarbons plus fishing rights.  They are initiated by failures of policy, mismanagement, and the absence of transparency and equity. They often result in political instability, resource degradation, and even regional fragmentation."

The third stage is marked by a decrease in the birth rate, owing mostly to socioeconomic changes, urbanization, and \nwidespread contraception use. At this point, population growth continues at a slower pace. More industrialized countries experienced a demographic transition in the eighteenth century, transitioning from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates. In the fourth stage, birth rates fall to levels where they are equal to death rates, resulting in a slowly growing population. In the fifth stage, the birth rate rose again but the death rate remained low bringing stable or low population growth.\nFigure 4.1.

As a result, between 1980 and 2010, the population of LDCs nearly doubled. The population of LDCs is expected to rise from 855 million in 201 1 to 1.67 billion by 2050, according to estimates (Figure 4.6).

Among the most important are the advancements in agriculture, which ensured human security and continued life. The growth of organized agricultural communities allowed for more worker specialization, which led to the development of the market economy and urban societies. This was the second major element that significantly boosted the population of those societies. The third major factor of high population rise was accompanied by new social and economic developments. Increased economic output was made possible by revolutions in agriculture and industry, which were accompanied by a quick and steadily increasing population. As a result of agricultural technology, which enabled society to produce more food from limited inputs, population growth rates changed dramatically during the industrial revolution. Over successive generations, as food sources increased, the average level of nourishment increased, and the vulnerability to chronic and communicable diseases decreased. \nThe overall reduction in the death rate has been the most important factor in the real expansion \nof the population, thanks to advances in medical knowledge and improvements in public health.

Measures of Fertility \nFertility is the actual occurrence of live births and reflects a population’s actual reproductive performance. The nature of fertility is determined by some factors. Marriage has undoubtedly been a fertility-promoting institution. The lower the fertility rate, the longer a woman waits to engage in a sexual partnership. Conversely, fertility rates are higher when women marry at a young age due to the increased risk of pregnancy and longer periods during which pregnancy could occur. Contraception is the other major factor that influences fertility in most developed countries. \nThe “reproductive revolution,” which was ushered in by the availability and development of \nmodern and effective family-planning technologies like the birth control pill, made it easier to avoid pregnancy. Finally, infertility is linked to either voluntary or involuntary fecundity. Breast-feeding, for example, reduces (but does not eliminate) the risk of pregnancy for up to twenty-one months after delivery. These determinants explain nearly all variations of infertility when taken together, with the relevance of each determinant varying based on the cultural, economic, health, and social factors present in a community. \nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, fertility will decline from 4.6 live births per woman in 2019 to 3.1 in \n2050, and then to 2.1 in 2100.

Each of these factors is briefly described below. \n is the most basic measurement of fertility.\nis  calculated as follows:\nCBR=1,000(B/p), where B is the number of annu -\nal births, and p is the mid-year total population. \nThe crude birth rate is simple to compute and can be used to determine fertility quickly. However, because it does not take into consideration a population’s age and sex structure, it cannot be used to compare populations or regions. This measurement’s denominator includes everyone, regardless of their fertility contribution (birth).\nCase Example 4.1: If the number of live births in a population of 90, 898,000 was 295,500, the crude birth rate is : CBR=(295,500 )/90,898,000 x1,000=3.25 birth per 1,000 per year\nII.

This measure isoften used to describe fertility patterns and to compare fertility rates across different regions,and it is a better measure of fertility than the crude birth rate since it takes into account thepopulation’s age and sex structure.

Gross Reproductive Rate (GRR)\nThe Gross Reproductive Rate (GRR) is comparable to the Total Fertility Rate (TFR), but itonly counts female births rather than all births. While total fertility can be used to determinewhether a population is growing or shrinking as a result of fertility, the Gross ReproductionRate (GRR) estimates the number of female offspring a woman will have based on age-specificrates and assuming she survives her reproductive years. In this approach, the GRR can be usedto determine whether or not a population is replacing itself. It’s calculated as follows:\nGRR=TFR x (\nFB)/( Bx)\nBased on the example 4.2, TFR = 2. Therefore, GRR=2 x ( FB)/( Bx) where Bx =78,500, \ntotal birth in 2020, FB =42,300, total female birth in 2020.\nGRR=2 x 42,300/78,500=1.077The GRR values close to 1.0 represent one female exactly replacing herself, so the population \ngrowth rate will be equal to 0. Values less than 1.0 indicate that the next generation of women will not replace themselves, while the current generation will more than replace themselves if the GRR is greater than 1.0."

When people migrate to a country, the entire population of that country is unaffected. The movement of people from one place to another has an impact on population distribution, cultural diffusion, and resource exploitation. The earliest human population moved around for game hunting, traveling, and plant gathering. People with archaic technologies have historically been forced to migrate due to environmental factors such as dwindling resources. Rural populations would be displaced in locations where agricultural land is overused. People in such situations frequently relocate to surrounding urban areas. Furthermore, people migrate in groups (clans, tribes) to obtain seasonal food and rear livestock.\nThere was a large free migration from all areas of Europe to North America, from Latin regions \nof Europe to Central and South America, and from Great Britain to Africa and Australia during the 16th and 20th centuries (pre-modern eras). Since World War II ended, the number of forced migrants has grown as individuals seek greater protection from war or natural disasters. Human trafficking is another way to move individuals from one place to another. For the sake of sexual exploitation or forced labor, it is done by force or fraud. The cause of current migration is still large-scale temporary labor force relocations from less-developed to more-developed economies. \nBecause of the vast number of people who cross international borders, international \nmigration frequently attracts the most political, economic, and demographic attention. Even though immigration has a long history, public emphasis has shifted to the size, sources, and consequences of large-scale migration. International immigration is fundamentally an economic process driven by a mix of ‘push’ factors in the source country, such as weak job opportunities, big populations, and low salaries. \nMigration, like fertility and mortality, has an impact on population growth rates in sending and \nreceiving countries. The annual change in population for every country is equal to birth minus death plus immigrants minus emigrants (B-D) + (I-E). For nearly half a century, worldwide migration has been expanding from less developed to more developed regions for economic (seeking better jobs) and political (seeking asylum or refugee) reasons. Over the previous fifteen to twenty years, the rate of migration towards richer regions has been quite high. Until the 1960s, natural increase accounted for the majority of population expansion in these areas; however, currently, immigration has contributed more to population growth than fertility."

Although \nthey earn less on average than natives and are primarily employed in low-paying, low-skilled occupations, immigrants are frequently found to be financially better off in their host country than in their home country. On the other side, because of direct rivalry with better competent immigrants in the job market, less-skilled natives may lose out in terms of income and labor prospects. The greatest apparent impact of immigration, however, is the shift in the cultural and racial makeup of receiving countries as immigrants make up a larger part of the population.Figure 4.9.

Although the most likely scenario is that the world’s population will continue to rise during this century, there is a 27 % chance that it may plateau or perhaps begin to fall before 2100. The range of possible trends in the three demographic components of population change: fertility, death, and international migration, determines the accuracy of population forecast. \nThe rapid population growth in LDCs is causing major issues, such as an increase in food \ndemand, an increase in the jobless workforce, a challenge to poverty eradication, congested social services, and the possibility of violence. However, recent fertility reductions have caused the population of working age to expand faster than that of other ages, allowing for quicker economic growth. To reap the benefits of this “demographic dividend,” governments must invest in education and health, particularly for young people, as well as foster circumstances that promote long-term economic growth. \nLow birth rates in more industrialized countries enable current slow growth, resulting in a \npopulation with a higher average age. As a result of population aging, there are fewer people of working age than there are older people. A low potential support ratio is caused by a low number of working-age people. \nInternational migration has already become a major component of population change in \nsome parts of the world.

Geographic location influences economic development through the distribution and types of geology, relief, climate, soils, and biodiversity. All these geographic factors pose an effect on the growth of agricultural production, industrialization, and commerce. Recently, the effect of these geographic variables has been virtually minimized through the use of modern technology. But still, the poorest countries of the world are found in the tropics where there is a hot climate; infertile soils; water scarcity, and tropical diseases. Geographical location thus appears upsetting development policy choices in society. Yet in response, development looks for lessening geographical barriers through technological advances. This designates that geographic features and development policies are closely linked and tied together. This unit thus addresses the linkage between geography and development. It also explains the bond between climate change and poverty; the challenges of landlocked populations; and the intraregional trade patterns in Africa."

Economic \ngrowth is an increase in goods and services or growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) in a nation over a specific period. It mainly focuses on the quantitative growth of the national per capita income; not giving due regard to the standard of living and welfare of citizens. Economic development on the other hand refers to the sustained development of the material well-being of society. Unlike economic growth, development focuses on both qualitative and quantitative development of the country’s economy. Economic development enables people to be more educated, healthier, and endowed with good access to quality housing, better sanitation, and employment opportunities. It is often measured using the Human Development Index (HDI).\nHDI is a quantitative measure of human wellbeing and development.  It is computed using \nthree dimensions: longevity (long and healthy life); access to knowledge and standard of living. Longevity is measured from life expectancy at birth.  Knowledge is measured from literacy rates and average years of schooling within the adult age group. The decent standard of living is also measured by real per capita income.  To obtain the final HDI result, each of the measurement results of the computed variables is first converted into 0-1 scales. The scaled values are then added to form the HDI. The calculated HDI values thus lie between 0 and 1. Countries scoring higher HDI values are hence considered to be better in human wellbeing and development. In the 2019 United Nations Development Program (UNDP, 2019) ranking of 189 world countries, Norway, Ireland and Switzerland (all in Europe) stood at the top with 0.957 , 0.955, and 0.955 HDI scores, respectively. Niger, Central African Republic (CAR), and Chad (all in Africa) assumed the bottom end by scoring only 0.394, 0.397 , and 0.398 HDI values. Ethiopia with a score of 0.485 HDI value ranked 173 of the 189 countries.\n5.1.2 Geographical determinism and possibilism\nGeography and socioeconomic development have strong linkages. There are two contrasting schools of thought on how geographic location and socioeconomic development are linked together. These differing philosophies are Geographical Determinism and Possibilism.  Henceforth, we are going to discuss these contrasting issues discretely. \nGeographical determinism assumes that the stage of socio-economic development of \ncountries is exclusively determined by the geographic environment (location, climate, and geomorphology)."

            "text": "Geographical location and economic development\nAccording to deterministic theorists, countries of the temperate regions are more developed \ncompared to those in the tropical areas because of their geographical location in distinct cold and hot environments, respectively. This type of thinking began during the 15thC AD and persisted until the 1950s. The first adherents of this philosophy were Greek and Roman scholars like Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Strabo. The leading advocates of geographic determinism in the 19th and 20thC were Karl Ritter (1779-1859), Ellen Churchill Semple (1863–1932), and Elsworth Huntington (187 6–1947). Later on, many geographers were interpreting socio-economic development through the deterministic approach. Nevertheless, the geographic deterministic school of thought falls under repeated crticism from part of the environmental possibilism followers.\nThe school of possibilism argues that geographic environment is not the only determinant \nfactor of the lifestyle of people and socio-economic development. According to these scholars, development is determined by the interaction of geographic location and human factors.\nAlthough geographic location and environmental factors play a significant role in socio-\neconomic development, they can be modified into useable opportunities by the creative mind of human beings. They conclude that ‘nature is never more than an adviser’ and ‘there are no necessities but everywhere possibilities’. The leading proponents of this school of thought were Lucien Paul Victor Febvre (1878–1956) and Paul Vidal de la Blache (1845–19 18). Their notion is now widely accepted by geographers because the belief appreciates the ability of humans to change their environment using the latest technologies. Nonetheless, it does not mean that geographic location never plays a significant role in the socio-economic development of societies and countries. \nGeographic location (where a country finds) has a substantial impact on the socio-economic \ndevelopment of countries. It is ‘an integral part of economic geography, regional science, and spatial economics. The location of economic development projects can be fixed through consideration of broader contexts of countries, regions, and global environments. Geographic location thus strongly influences the scope of ‘firms in that location’ through controlling the distribution of the population (purchasing power); economic patterns; transport costs and trading networks.\nThe cost of moving goods and services across spatial scales can influence the access of firms \nto markets. The costs and networks of transportation facilities affect the relative relevance of firms and the scale of decisions concerning innovation and capital investments."

Three theories each focusing on the three discrete activities questioning ‘what economic activities are located where and why are discussed. The theories explore the site selection of firms, and examination of the geographic variation of economic activities. They offer an analysis of the spatial uncertainties and hierarchical structure of economic segments. The theories identify variables that determine the location of specific undertakings over a given spatial patterns. They also describe the allocation of the different parts of the territory among the different product types.\n5.1.3 Effect of location on agricultural development\nAgricultural production and profitability principally rely on the suitability of land use patterns and environmental resources that are largely related to geographic location. Under this topic, you are going to learn about the hypothetical land-use model (Figure 5.1) developed some 200 years ago by the German theorist named Johann Heinrich von Thünen. \nFigure 5.1 von Thünen’s hypothetical circular land use model\nJohann Heinrich von Thünen developed his agricultural land use theory in 1826 in his book \nThe Isolated State. This earliest known agricultural location theory (von Thünen, 1826), imag -\nined that being near to the market provides ample benefits in agricultural land-use systems. For that, he envisioned a central market city established at the heart of a plain of thorough physical similarities. \nThe intent of von Thunen in developing this model (Figure 5.1) was to show the system of ris -\ning agrarian yield in concentric sectors. His model imagines that farmers nearer to the market \ncity grow crops that have a premier price and provide the highest net incomes."

Bulky products (firewood & timber) are supposed to cover the next zone for they demand higher transport costs if produced further from the city market. Field crops such as grains are proposed to come from the third zone because they require relatively lower transport costs compared to vegetables and forest products. Ranching of animals is suggested to occupy the fourth zone for they can be self-transporting to market. The final zone beyond the fourth ring is suggested to remain free (unoccupied wilderness) for it is far from the city market.\nJ.H. von Thünen was a ‘German farmer and amateur economist’ \nof the 18thC AD.  His proposed market city is located in an ‘Isolated State’ which is supposed to be ‘self-sufficient’ or with no external influences. Four concentric zones: intensive farming (dairying); forest gardening; extensive cropping and animal grazing were proposed activities in the model. Farmers were considered equally rational everywhere. Johann Heinrich von Thünen (1783-1850)\nAccording to von Thunen, when the distance to the market increases, production costs \nremain the same; transport costs increase but locational rent is assumed to decrease (meaning transport cost and locational rent are inversely related). During his time there was no motor transport; maybe oxcarts were everywhere. As it was pre-industrialization there were no fossil fuels for energy production, refrigerators, and railroads. His interesting illustration of land and transport is somewhat excellent for his time. As one moves closer to the city, the cost of land increases. This is also true at present times. The theory is still important to geography although the isolated self-sufficient State and isotropic surface models unlikely to be found today."

He developed the least cost industrial location model in his book titled Theory of the Location of Industries. The theory was first presented in the German language (in 1909) and later translated into English in 1929. The model is considered the basis of modern industrial location theory. \nLike, von Thünen, Weber adopted several assumptions during writing his least-cost location \ntheory. Some of his assumptions include the following:\nFirms choose a suitable location to minimize total costs and maximize profits,\nAn isolated region having no external influences,\nIsotropic space (with no variations in transport costs),\nMarkets are located in a specific number of centers, \nPerfect competition (large numbers of firms & customers, and small firm sizes to \nprevent disturbances by monopolies and oligopolies),  \nComplete knowledge of market conditions (both for the buyers and suppliers). \nSeveral ubiquitous natural resources (e.g. water, air, sunlight, sand, etc.)\nMany localized materials: materials found at specific locations (e.g. labor, fuel, \nminerals, crops, wood, etc.)\nWeber assumed three key factors (transport & labor costs, plus agglomeration economies) influence industrial location. He then concluded that the firm location has to consider the three ideal (optimal) factors. He then decided to rely on determining the least transport cost location by adjusting it to consider labor costs and agglomeration economies. The cost of transportation was the most important component of Weber’s least-cost location theory. Other factors (labor & agglomeration economies) for him require only consideration of adjustment effects. Thus Weber uses the ‘Location Triangle’ (Figure 5.2) to solve the mentioned problems.\nAlfred Weber suggested that industrial firms have to locate in places where costs of transporting \nraw materials and finished products are kept low. For that he identified two particular cases:\nWeight losing: this is the case when the weight of the final product is less than the \nweight of the raw material going into making the product. \nWeight gaining: this is the case when the final product is heavier than the raw \nmaterials that require transport."

Industrial firms using pure (non-weight losing inputs) during the process of \nproduction can locate nearer to markets. The inputs of such industries are bulk-gaining materials and they do not attract industrial firms to their occurrence locations. Examples of these are cotton textiles, soft-drink bottling, brewery, and beverages, wool, etc. Adding weight during processing for these industries makes the product bulky and more costly for shipping and transportation.\nb. Industries using impure gross materials lose part of their weight of raw materials during the production processes. The inputs of these industries are bulk-reducing. Such materials exert a strong influence on the location of industrial firms. Examples are bauxite and iron-ore refineries plus steel and sugar-cane mills. Industries using such raw materials have better locate nearer to their input sources. These enable the firms to carry the heavier raw materials for short distances lightening the finished goods for long distances to the marketplace.\nRelying on the aforementioned input-output firm relationships, Alfred Weber developed the material index model by dividing the weight of inputs by the weight of finished products:\nM  =       WIs  ; Where:\nWOs\nMI = Material Index;    WIs= Weight of Inputs;   WOs= Weight of Outputs. Then, he concludes:\nIf MI >1, the industrial firm should locate nearer to the source of the raw material,\nIf MI <1, the firm should locate nearer to the market.\nWeber proposes firms using bulky inputs like aluminum refineries should locate nearer to the \nsupply sources; nearer to energy sources or at port sites. According to Weber, industries that use ubiquitous raw materials (e.g. water, solar power) are likely located closer to markets. \nAlfred Weber was an economist, geographer, and sociologist.  \nHis theory was persuasive in the progress of present-day eco -\nnomic geography. He did a reputable job during his time in an industrial location. Nevertheless, his work was focused on heavy industries and forgot the light industrial firms. Alfred Max Weber (1868-1958)"

Effect of location on settlement and service center development\nIn the previous two topics, you learned how the location of land uses and industries were \nmodeled by two German scholars. The topic at hand presents the spatial structure, size, function, and location of settlements and service centers. This was first attempted by another German geographer named Walter Christaller in 1933. Christaller developed his theory by studying settlement patterns in southern Germany. He intended to know how urban settlements evolve and spaced out with each other and how goods and services are exchanged within the different order settlements.  While formulating his theory, Christaller presumed an isotropic boundless plain landscape experiencing a uniform physical environment. He assumed also that this isotropic surface is uniformly settled and equally served by transportation in all directions. Travelling and transportation costs for goods and services are explained to be a function of the distance traveled. Farmers earn the same amount of income (equal purchasing power) and similar demand for goods and services. Both farmers and business people in urban areas are also considered rational - seeking to minimize costs and maximize incomes. Perfect competition, equivalent income, and ‘shopping behavior’ on the parts of consumers are parts of the assumptions. No suppliers will receive excessive profit in the model. \nBased on these assumptions, Christaller had developed a geometric hexagonal pattern of \nsettlements and service centers in hierarchical order. For Christaller, the hexagonal structure was preferred for it minimizes the problems of overlapping prevalent in using concentric circular arrangements. His hierarchical model anticipated a well-established urban system containing a large city, a smaller number of towns, and many villages and hamlets in the hypothetical region. Christaller’s central place hierarchy assumed uniform distribution and equivalent distance among the different levels of settlements and service centers all-over the ‘isotropic’ region. Christaller adopted three principles in his idealized hierarchical hexagonal settlement model of the central places. These include the:\n1. Marketing principle (K = 3 system); \n2. Transportation principle (K = 4 system);3. Administrative principle (K = 7 system).Similar to the land-use model of von Thünen, Weber assumed an \nisotropic landscape model by ignoring the role played by relief fea -\ntures and his ‘isotropic space’ assumption forgets the diverse trans-portation modes and costs. The proposed self-sufficient ‘isolated state’ with no external influences is difficult to find in reality; thus, threatens the validity of his model."

The premise here is that all goods and services are accessed by consumers from the nearest market centers (central places). This is the marketing principle (k = 3) indicated in number (i) above. \nFigure 5.3 Christaller’s hexagonal settlement model\nThe k = 3 system (Figure 5.3a) is where the hexagonal space with the center envisioned that \none higher-order central place serves three (two lower-order neighboring centers and itself). Hence, three centers together with the central place itself are served. The objective of the K = 3 system is designed to serve several consumers from a few numbers of service centers. The 3s rule implies 1, 3, 9, 27 , 81 …) – meaning that consumers located at equidistant centers from the three higher-order centers (A1, A2 & A3) could acquire one third from each of A1, A2, and A3 centers. As there could be several settlement orders, 1\nst, 2nd, and 3rd order service \ncenters, correspondingly provide 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order services. \nWalter Christaller was a German geographer who wrote a \ngroundbreaking theory titled ‘Central Places in Southern Ger -\nmany’ in 1933. His theory consists of the simple concepts of ‘centrality’, ‘threshold’, and ‘range’. Centrality refers to a pull to a particular center. A threshold is the minimum purchasing power (population & income) required to attract a firm or new service provider. A range is a maximum distance that people travel to acquire goods and services. Walter Christaller (1893-1969)\nSimilar to the location theories of von Thünen and Weber, the ‘isotropic’ surface and alike purchasing power assumptions are perhaps unrealistic. Anyhow, Christaller’s central place theory is cutting-edge innovative work even in the present-day world. It is an important theory in geography and economics."

To decrease travel costs, lower-order settlements are suggested to locate at mid-points of the sides along the roads connecting higher order settlements instead of situating at the edges of the hexagons. This implies that transport routes are lined up along straight courses stretching out from the mid-points. In this case, each central place is supposed to support half of the marketplace of each of six adjoining low-order settlements as they are placed at the edges of the hexagons around high-order centers. The total number of sites served will be thus four – meaning there will be four low-order settlements for each high-order center (see Figure 5.3b) against three in the case of the K = 3 system. \nThe K = 7 system aims to retain a hierarchy of control between high-order and low-order \nsettlements. Under this system, six low-order settlements in the hexagon will be wholly served, controlled, and enclosed by the central place (by the high-order place). This provides comparable seven market centers. Christaller envisioned this hierarchical model enabling the entire high-order settlements in the hexagon enclosed by further high-order settlements to elucidate both local and regional economics as well as the specialty of urban areas.

Extreme climatic events seriously affect poor people in those countries in many ways. Extremely poor people receive only 1.90 United States Dollars (USD) per day. About 10% of the global population is estimated to live within this threshold.  An estimated 850 million people are quiet living now with <1.25 USD daily income of which the majority of those living below this poverty line are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is estimated also that nearly 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity. Other 900 million people have no access to clean fresh water and some other 2.6 billion lack access to improved sanitation.  Similarly, nearly 800 million rural inhabitants lack access to all-weather roads. All these are poverty syndromes intensified by extreme climates.  The root causes of such extreme climate initiated poverty conditions are:\nVulnerability to droughts, flooding, typhoons, and locust invasions, \nLack of  good governance (absence of proper law enforcement),\nRemoteness from service centers (lack of all-weather roads),\nProperty right related problems including tenure insecurity,\nLack of adequate infrastructure and services (roads, water, electricity, education, health),\nPoor access to markets and weak social networks,\nDemographic related characteristics (e.g. household sizes, age & sex composi -\ntions & dependency levels),\nUnemployment and underemployment levels, and\nShelter and nutrition-related problems.\nHitherto, climate extremes intensify community, household, and individual levels of \npoverty through injuring infrastructure, distorting employment opportunities, and violating health, education, and housing services. Climate change extremes can, in general, impede socioeconomic development, reduce food security and expand poverty.\nExposure to climate hazards (extremes) and poverty levels are commonly derived from growing \npopulations, urbanization (where immigrants reside in marginal hazard-prone areas), settling in coastal and floodplain areas, and the destruction and losses of natural ecosystems.\nPoor people in the Developing Countries (DCs) commonly live in peripheral urban areas that \nare exposed to the risks of flooding and urban waste. In the rural areas poor people often occupy drought-prone environments that are exposed to climate extremes. These poor people often lack access to necessary information and social support opportunities. They lack also the potential and capacity required to cope-up and respond to the climate extremes (Table 5.1)."

Field crops and domestic animals are damaged by the floods. These occasions further aggravate food insecurity and livelihood perils over households and then result in chronic poverty. During extreme flooding events, human settlements and urban infrastructures (water and power supply services) will be destroyed. The loss of similar physical assets and property due to extreme flooding events in poor areas generally causes displacements. Such events not only devastate properties but also disrupt the informal social networks of people in the affected areas (e.g. see a sample case from Ethiopia).\nCASE STUDY I\nEthiopia: Preventive measures not enough to avoid loss and damage from extreme floodsAn increase in the frequency and severity of flooding in Ethiopia is affecting the livelihoods of small-scale agropastoralists who rely on the land for subsistence. A study conducted in the Itang District of the Gambella region found that despite applying a variety of preventive measures against flooding, households were still experiencing severe negative impacts (e.g. lost harvests and livestock, damage to houses and property). Furthermore, relying on social networks to cope in the aftermath of a flood was found to be unsustainable, as repeated floods erode this social capital.\nWhat is the greatest climatic stressor?\nSince 2000, households in the Itang area of the Gambella region in Ethiopia have reported dealing with increasingly severe floods. From 2006 to 2012 the region suffered a major flood every year, except for 2009 when they suffered from drought. The floods were especially severe in 2007 and 2012. In both years, the floodwaters that normally retreat by October were still high in mid-November. Households annually experience flooding when the Baro River, a tributary to the Nile and the widest river in Ethiopia, overflows."

Due to their unpredictability, these flash floods can be especially disastrous as they are capable of destroying crops and livestock without warning.\nWhat is the impact?\nAs the region is primarily inhabited by agropastoralists that rely heavily on the land, flooding negatively affected nearly all of the 43 1 households surveyed. Ninety-four percent of respondents reported that their crops were severely damaged or destroyed following the 2007 flood. In addition to losing crops, 5 1 percent reported the loss of livestock, whose dairy products and meat are heavily relied upon for sale and consumption. Furthermore, the inability of livestock to graze due to flooded grazing land reduced dairy production in 2007 by half. Large-scale destruction of crops also leads to higher food prices, which make staple foods such as maize unaffordable and force already desperate households to reduce their food consumption.\nHow do affected people deal with floods?\nThe research found that households adopt both short- and long-term preventive measures. Short-term measures are undertaken right before a flood and include moving household property and livestock to relatives in unaffected areas, selling livestock before a flood, and harvesting premature crops. Longer-term measures include digging ditches around property and farms, raising the floors of homes, and erecting boundary walls. These preventive measures are effective for minor floods, but as floods increase in severity such measures become inadequate.\nIn the aftermath of a flood, respondents primarily cope by appealing \nto their social networks for support (i.e. relatives in unaffected areas), which usually comes in the form of shelter, food, and financial and material assistance. The government and NGOs also provide some assistance (e.g. food and shelter); however, this is rarely sufficient and only available during or immediately after a flood. Following a flood, households also resort to selling livestock and property to pay for food and other necessities.\nTaken from Warner et al. (2021)"

People \nrepeatedly exposed to damaging droughts, floods, and famines are often hit by poverty traps due to climate extremes. Poverty traps often happen when the impacts of extreme climates frequently hit poor people and persist for tens of years. Grave thresholds or irremediable harms occur from the merger of numerous non-climate related variables. For instance, when the social-network ties of poor people repeatedly break due to lingering climate extremes and poverty, their reciprocal support weakens. Coupled with the already existing poverty, the coping capacity of the poor further weakens and exposes them to aggravated lingering poverty traps (e.g. see a sample case from Burkina Faso, Africa). \nCASE STUDY II\nLoss and damage example: A dream of peaceful retirement shattered by droughtMy name is Ag Ayad Inanchanan. I was born in 1937 , and am a veteran of the Burkina Faso army. During my military service, I invested all my earnings in livestock. I thought that would guarantee a peaceful retirement. When I left the army, I had 135 cattle, 87 sheep, and 45 goats. The drought of 1973–74 changed everything. I lost 75 cattle that year because of the scarcity of fodder and drinking water. I was forced to sell some 30 heads also to save the remaining animals and maintain my household. That year, my two brothers lost all their livestock. With no property, they moved in with me and became part of my household. With my herd decimated, I decided to start vegetable cultivation. I was the first gardener in Tin-Akoff along the Beli River. I had seen how that was done when I was stationed in the south. Irrigation allows me to carry on even if the rains fail, but the small profits from gardening do not allow me to reinvest in livestock and expand my herd up to previous levels. It is only enough to maintain my family. Despite my efforts to become less dependent on rainfall, we continue to suffer from the negative effects of drought on our farm. My situation started to worsen again during the drought and locust invasion of 2004. I lost 20 of the 30 heads of cattle I had then. Then, in 201 1, I lost 165 small ruminants that drowned in the Beli River when searching for fodder. A big rain that was sudden and brutal washed them away. And this year, 2012, I will not even harvest 1kg of millet from my field due to the invasion of birds in the area. Because I do not have enough animals to sell, I was forced to sell one of my handcarts to cover my food needs. The situation is becoming increasingly catastrophic. I never imagined my life would look like this now when I thought I was going on to a peaceful retirement.\nTaken from Warner et al. (2021)"

Lack of direct access to the sea; isolation from major economic centers; inadequate conveyance setups; and clumsy transit practices together impede the ability of landlocked states to grow effectually.\nLandlocked countries lie far from seaports and lack direct access to the sea. They incur higher transport costs during their participation in foreign trades. The cost of international transport services is a crucial determinant of a country’s trade competitiveness. Higher trade costs reduce a country’s welfare and inhibit economic growth by making imports expensive and exports none-competitive. Landlocked countries, therefore, suffer noticeable drawbacks when competing in global markets against coastal areas. It has been estimated that doubling transport costs reduces a country’s trade volume by around 80%.\nExcessive transport costs also impede the trade in services, mainly the export of tourism \nservices. Doubling travel cost reduces the demand for tourism as high as eightfold. \nLandlocked countries are entirely dependent on their transit neighbors’ infrastructure for access to an international market. Where a landlocked country only has access to routes of poor quality, the cost of overland trade is significantly higher than it would otherwise be. Hence, the cost of trade in a landlocked country is heavily determined by the infrastructure levels, and, indirectly, by the level of development of its transit neighbors. \nChallenges of poor transit neighbor substructures are mainly severe in western and central \nAfrica. For instance, although boasting of having better domestic road connections, Burundi is severely affected by the poor contiguous transit network of its neighbors. The short direct passage to the sea from Burundi is the so-called Central Corridor over Tanzania (Dar es Salaam). Nevertheless, the transit setup over this route is too poor. Of all the countries in the world, 49 of them are landlocked (see some from Figure 5.9). This \nnumber is equivalent to one-fifth (20%) of all countries in the world. They are also among the most disadvantaged and underachieving countries in the world. They are generally divorced from the benefits received from locating along the sea coast."

The best example here is the (CAR). This country has no reliable all-weather road network to the sea. Its transit through Cameroon is impenetrable during the rainy season. Its transit corridor over the Oubangui River of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is also closed in the dry season due to diminished water flow and for security reasons.  \nTo transit a country, there are hosts of transit and custom charges. Some of these must be \npaid upfront and some must be paid during traveling. In many cases, these charges must be paid in hard currency, where options are missing to convert local currency to hard currency. Sometimes agency fees at ports for transit freight may exceed that of domestic freight. \nThe transit and custom charges include transit good licenses, border fees, temporary road \nlicenses, foreign vehicle permits, toll charges, foreign commercial licenses, cost of customs verification of containers, posting of security bonds, involvement with police and escort convoys, and cancellation of bonds. \nCurrently, there are some successful efforts and strategies in certain areas to ease procedures \nand lessen administrative charges. For instance, common warrants have been announced in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) allowing road freight travel within member countries with no local permits or licenses. Another good example is the Bhutanese transit trade in South Asia. The transit of the Bhutanese trade is handled by its customs and never touched by Indian officials. \nPolitical issues are also major challenges for the development of landlocked countries next to \ntransportation. The deficiency of negotiating capacity with transit neighbors is one challenge faced by landlocked countries. The lack of access rights during conflict times from transit neighbors seriously affects the mentioned states. Civil conflicts within the countries themselves sometimes cause difficulties even if countries have good relations with those of the transit neighbors. During such conditions, trade routes may be cut due to border closures. The LLDCs often possess little negotiating power over their transit neighbors.Political relations strongly impact trade and commodity flows in LLDCs. For example, Bolivia has severe transit limitations in Chile as the two countries have weak political relations that have for more than 100 years. Armenia is presently blocked by ethnic Armenians and Turkey whilst conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea have denied Ethiopia’s use of the port of Assab and Massawa after 1997 ."

Alternative routes through Kenya, Sudan, and Somalia are characterized by poorly developed transport networks.\nPolitical instability and conflict among the transit nations in Africa have been frequently \nobstructing their international trade.

Just to mention a few cases:\naffected by regional conflicts since 2012\n protests and internal conflicts in the 1990s; \n ethnic violence1993-1994; \n the 10 years civil war (199 1-2002);\ncoups and rebel wars (2008); \n a decade of violent civil wars (1989-2005);\nrecent political crisis (since the 2002);\nThe mentioned political instabilities and administrative barriers strongly hindered the foreign \ntrade of LLDCs of Africa. These all cause transit delays and route blockades. For instance, mean transit delays during border crossings all over Africa range from 24-48 hours. In some areas, it can take even weeks. The mean trip from Kampala to Mombasa for instance takes about 21 days. Sometimes, the trip may take 60 days. Note that similar delays take place in other transit and port areas of Africa. \nGenerally, landlocked countries face dependence based on the infrastructure levels of the \ntransit nations.

Tapping into Africa’s regional trade potential will require coordination between regions. Yet, the said regional coordination requires strong production and processing potential and careful consideration of nutrition-sensitive consumer demands. Both tariffs and non-tariff measures (NTMs) can incentivize trans- shipment and smuggling, or heighten the risk for businesses working to build streamlined, secure, and transparent supply chains. \nCASE STUDY III\nInformal currency exchange in informal trade in East AfricaIn Ethiopia, once prices are agreed upon in the relevant currencies, they are automatically converted into Birr at prevailing black market rates. Both buyers and sellers, including the delalas (brokers), carry small calculators for such purposes. At the time of this study, the value of Birr in the black market was less than the official exchange rate. For instance, the official exchange is Birr 1 = Ksh 13, while the black-market rate is Birr 1= Ksh (Kenyan Shilling) 5–6. Similarly, the black-market exchange rates for the Djibouti franc fluctuated around 30 percent of the official rate. All key informants (operators and local administrators) complain that the value, or purchasing power, of Birr, is falling. The economic implication is that terms of trade are unfavorable to Ethiopia; ICBT export values are substantially lower than the value of imports. This situation is consistent with current trade balances–a large deficit in the trade balance and a shortage in foreign currencies–in the formal foreign trade at the national level in Ethiopia.

Delays, costs, and administrative burdens discourage private investment in regional supply chains of sensitive agricultural products. They may partly explain also the high reliance on the informal trade of fruits, vegetables, and other time-sensitive goods. If these barriers are removed, time-sensitive agricultural foods (agri-foods) may offer good opportunities to enhance regional trade through the agri-food value chains."

Three basic theories are known to geographers in this respect: Agricultural location theory; industrial location theory and the central place theory. These theories are based on different assumptions about how agriculture, industry, and trade are influenced by geographic location, respectively.\nExtreme climatic events result in droughts, unexpected rainfall, and sudden floods. \nThese, in turn, cause the loss of biodiversity; death of plants and animals; reduction in agricultural yield, and health problems. The event indirectly threatens human livelihoods. As livelihood assets are reduced, households are exposed to chronic poverty. Poor people in turn negatively impact the natural environment through the harvest of livelihood assets. This again leads to more climate variability and creates a vicious cycle of climate-change-poverty mismatch.\nLandlocked countries are those that do not have access to the sea. For instance, \nEthiopia is a land-locked country that does not have a seaport.  There are over 30 landlocked countries in the World. These countries pay a large amount of money to import and export commodities. This affects their economic development seriously. Ethiopia’s foreign trade is also largely affected by the lack of its seaports. It is dependent on Djibouti, Sudan, and other countries for its international trade. This has had a huge impact on its development. Improper government policies; lack of access to improved transportation facilities; and administrative barriers also influence intra-regional trade in Africa in addition to the lack of sea access to international trade in many countries.UNIT SUMMARY"

All features of the environment surrounding an individual animal at any given point in time are described as habitat. \nLandscape modification by humans is by far the most major modern source of habitat loss, \nfragmentation, and biodiversity loss around the planet. Humans can alter landscapes and habitats spatially through five different methods: perforation, dissection, fragmentation, shrinkage, and attrition. Natural processes can also change landscapes and eliminate habitats for certain animals. Natural occurrences such as floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and temperature shifts, for example, cause habitat destruction.

While the area between remains of natural vegetation cover may extend, some species prefer disturbed settings. Individuals may survive in a deteriorated habitat for a long time even if they are unable to reproduce. Some types of habitat degradation take a long time to have an impact on a particular species. For example, the loss of huge trees with cavities is a major issue in forest and woodland ecosystems all across the world, threatening many individual species. Long-term population losses as a result of habitat degradation may thus go unnoticed or be extremely difficult to remedy once discovered. Extinction debt refers to the time it takes for a species to become extinct as a result of landscape change. \nAs a result, understanding what constitutes a habitat for a certain species is critical to addressing \nhabitat loss. This knowledge is required to comprehend why species react to landscape change in the manner they do. Habitat restoration should be conducted by continual management, protection measures, and reconstruction of deteriorated or destroyed regions.The introduction of invasive species into environments is also a major factor in the extinction of native species.

It is especially important when the food supply must be expanded, such as during periods of high population increase. Agricultural intensification was successful in increasing agricultural productivity by using improved seeds (high yielding varieties), inputs (high doses of fertilizers, pesticides, and weedicides), heavy machinery, and copious water for irrigation with good soils, but it failed to address some environmental issues. \nOpening up natural ecosystems for agriculture reduces carbon stokes which results in the \nnet removal of nutrients from available soil stocks, and reduces ecosystem variety; hence agroecosystem productivity and natural resource integrity are fundamentally enemies. More land would have been used for agriculture in order to increase agricultural output, thereby destroying forests, marshes, and other ecosystems.  The way heavy land use affects on biodiversity in an environment has a strong relationship with its evolutionary history. \nWhen population pressure on land is modest, there is frequently flexibility to control unfavorable \ninteractions and trade-offs by changes in the temporal and spatial arrangements among fields. Due to this, there is a chance for significant “affinity between agro-ecosystem productivity and natural resource.” Due to increasing population pressure on the land and a lack of flexibility in land use patterns, soil degradation happens. As a consequence, fertilizer inputs are needed to prime farming systems, which accelerates soil deterioration.  When environmental or social issues are involved, intensification that makes more efficient use of resources may be more crucial.6.1.2.

Some species, such as the rose, modify leaves into thorns, while another plant species might develop fruit only at the top of its canopy, out of reach of a non-climbing predator.\n6.1.4.1. Causes of invasive species expansion\nThe proliferation of invasive species is often exacerbated by climate change. Changes in the species that cause a genetic variation and increase an organism’s ability to survive could occur in response to climate change. Flooding can cause a new invasive aquatic or wetland plant invasion but it can also be used to control them. Flooding is a type of disturbance, just like plowing, fire, or any other practice that disrupts the soil profile and denudes the surface of vegetation. Invasive plant species love disturbance because it provides an opportunity for the establishment. Flooding has also been used to a limited extent to control aquatic and wetland invasive plants.

Wetlands can get overgrown with invasive plant species to the point where native birds no longer choose to live there. Invasive plant species pose a threat to freshwater supplies. Aquatic and wetland plants compete for sunshine, nutrients, and water with invasive aquatic and wetland plants. They are generally more aggressive than their native equivalents in getting these nutrients and consuming them, leaving little for native plants. As a result, a biologically diversified plant ecosystem has given way to a monoculture of one invading species. \nAquatic invasive plants are modified structurally to live in water. They have been categorized \nfurther based on their location in the aqueous environment. These categories are floating, emergent, and submerged.\nFloating weeds are plants that rest upon the water surface, and their roots hang freely on the \nwater or sometimes attach to the bottom of shallow ponds or streams. \nEmergent species are plants that grow in natural marshlands and can be found around the \nshorelines of ponds and in the littoral zone of lakes.\nFigure 6.4.

The water hyacinth can be found in pure strands along the edges of ponds, lakes, canals, ditches, and slow-moving streams, and it flourishes in shallow freshwater marshes. The plants have fibrous and dark roots beneath the water level. A horizontal stem known as a stolon connects the rosettes at the waterline.

Ecological classification of invasive plants\nThe invasive plants are often classified using ecological categories related to population be -\nhavior. Four phases of invasion are defined as follows. \nThe introduction is the phase of invasion that results from dispersed weeds arriving at a site \nbeyond their previous geographical range and establishing populations of adult plants. Trans-portation species become common in an area.\nNaturalization is the second phase, during which the species establishes new self-sustaining \npopulations, disperses widely, and integrates into the local flora. Abiotic variables (such as high temperature, high PH, high salinity, NO-3, or NH4+) determine whether an introduced species can survive and reproduce in the new environment. \nColonization is the third step, in which plants in the founding population reproduce and multiply to form a self-sustaining colony. Alien organisms compete for resources by growing quickly and efficiently. \nDispersal is the fourth step of dispersal and establishment in new places, and it is determined \nby dispersal ability, dispersal vectors, and habitat connectedness. The pace of dissemination can be determined by kinetic production, tolerance to low P and N availability, relatively high salt tolerance, sea currents, and strong shipping activity.

In the contemporary world, the greatest challenge is to meet the needs of large and growing populations while ensuring the sustainability of environmental resources. The linkages between population dynamics, inequalities, and resource degradation are major contemporary geographic issues. This unit; therefore, presents and discusses on some of the major geographic issues and public concerns of our current world. These include popula -\ntion-related public concerns of our contemporary world; land degradation and desertification; unemployment and underemployment; drought and famine; deforestation and the worldwide digital divide.\n7 .1.\nWORLD\nAt the end  this section, you will be able to:\nidentify major population growth-related challenges of the Developing Countries \n(DCs), \nassess remedial measures to the population dynamics in the DCs.\nevaluate the relationship between family size and education access in the developing and developed world,\ndescribe the mismatch between population growth and the rate of economic growth, \nshow how population growth affects economic growth  (living standards of people) in the developing world, and\nassess remedial measures to the population dynamics in the DCs.The population-related concerns of our present world are principally family sizes, household income levels, education access, rates of population and economic growth (standard of living), unemployment, and underemployment. This topic thus focuses on these important variables that pose a significant impact on household livelihoods. You are hence expected to grasp basic knowledge of these essential components. \nKeywords:"

The natural growth rates have been continuously declining in those countries for numerous decades. The highest population growth rates in the DCs on the other hand were experienced from 1960 to 1990. Yet, population growth rates have been falling in all countries for the last 20 years. Nevertheless, the highest population growth is predicted to happen in the DCs. This will probably worsen the poverty levels in those countries. The situation could add stress on the basic economic and social services like health, education, and the environment in the DCs. From the DCs, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will face the most rapid rate of population growth in the coming decades coming.  Most rapid population increases during the coming decades are also assumed to occur in urban areas (in cities & towns) of the DCs. The increased urban population often comes with more challenges and prospects.\nGenerally, population pressure and rapid urbanization in the DCs would probably result in \nsevere socioeconomic and environmental challenges. For instance, it can result in:\nRapid environmental change (land degradation, resource depletion & air pollution),\nBiodiversity loss, habitat destruction, species contraction,\nExtended urbanization (expansion of slums and squatter settlements in urban \nareas),\nChronic poverty and malnutrition (food insecurity and water scarcity),7 .1.1 Population Growth-Related Challenges in the Developing Countries (DCs) and     \nRemedial Measaures"

This may influence the quality of education.

Spending more years in schooling delays the probability of childbirth and enables smaller family sizes. Households with an extended number of children are more likely to invest less money for child education and healthcare which thus pushes to continual poverty (see Figure 7 .1). Educating women thus helps to minimize the rate of births. Limiting the size of families similarly contributes to the attainment of better education.\nFigure 7 .2.

Such households provide co-residence to children (< age 15 \nyears) and elders (> age 60 years). Such families are frequent in Africa (1 4%) and Asia (13%); but rare in the USA and Europe which is around 2% (Figure 7 .2). Similarly, skipped generation households refer to the co-residence of elders (grandparents) with grandchildren; however, not parents of the grandchildren. \nHousehold income: household income consists of all earnings, whether monetary or in-\nkind (such as goods and services), collected by households or their members annually or at frequent intervals. However, it excludes bonus gains and other irregular and typically one-time earnings.  \nIncome distribution is uneven across the world scales. Income from wealthy countries emerges \nfrom 16% of the population and accounts for 55% of the world total. DCs account for 72% of the world population but contribute only 1% to the global total. For instance, mean incomes from North America and the European Union are about 16 and 1 1 times larger than that of SSA, respectively. Nevertheless, the per-capita incomes of DCs are increasing faster than the MDCs. Nonetheless, the absolute average per-capita income gap between DCs and MDCs had increased from about $27 ,600 in 1990 to over $42,800 in 2018. Mean income gaps (inequalities) between citizens of DCs are too large.\nLower economic growth rates and more employment losses excessively affect people in the \nDCs. Enormous employment and income losses rapidly push an immense rise in poverty. Low-income households often hold a large number of children and investment is low on human capital. They are frequently exposed to a meager food supply and poor health. Households with fewer children and more income, invest more money per child for nutrition, health, and education. Recently, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been worsening disparities within countries.\n7 .1.3 Rate of Population and Economic Growth\nThe problems of growing populations and food supplies have been the main concern of peo-ple since historical times. Some people perceive that the relationship between population and economic growth is direct while others believe the relationship is indirect. There are thus two major contrasting views concerning the relationship existing between population growth and economic development. These are:\n1. The pessimistic Malthusian and neo-Malthusians views and\n2. Optimistic anti-Malthusian views."

He considered the catastrophes are inevitable positive checks of population growth emerging to equalize the imbalance between population and economic growth. Malthus proposed preventive checks in place of the inevitable positive checks to control population growth. Preventive checks to Malthus are moral restraints that include delayed marriage, avoidance of making sexual meetings, and having fewer children. Thomas Malthus developed his theory in 1798 in his treatise titled: “An Essay on the Principles of Population”.\nUnlike Malthus, Neo- Malthusians have different view on the  preventive check i.e, \nfamily planning need to be addressed. They argue that there is an imbalance between rates of population and economic growth. They believe that rapid population growth retards economic progress."

He was among \nthe socialist (communist) theorists that op -\npose the theory of Thomas Robert Malthus. According to Karl Marx, production in the capitalist economic system is not targeted at meeting people’s needs; but an accumulation of capital. 2) Anti-Malthusian views\nThese are of two types: a) Marxist view; and b) Boserupianview\nKarl Marx\n(1818 – 1883)\nThe system considers the poor unnourished people as a ‘sur -\nplus population’. Capitalism uses the ‘surplus population’ for \nsecuring job competition among the jobless to cut wages and maximize profits for the ultimate capital accumulation. Marx, finally, suggests socialism as the best solution to growing pop -\nulations and increasing food demands. He advocated the es -\ntablishment of socialism; a new social system with differing economic structures and socio-political orders.\nEsther Boserup was a Danish economist of the 20th C. \nShe argued that population growth can be compensat -\ned through food production using induced technolo-gy and innovation. She developed this anti-Malthusian theory in a thesis titled: “Theory on Population and Agriculture” in 1965; against Thomas Malthus. Bose -\nrup argues population is an important variable that positively influences agricultural development through the application of innovative technology.\nEsther Boserup \n(1910 – 1999)\nBoserup and her supporters argue population growth could not \nbe regulated by the shortage of food supplies and necessities as reported in Malthus (1798). According to these scholars, the increasing demand for food supplies from growing populations encourages agricultural innovation and the use of technologies in farming to keep pace with the growing needs. In this context, Boserup confirms that necessity is the mother of invention."

            "text": "Geographic issues and concerns\nAnti-Malthusians are in general optimists who consider population growth shall not slow \ndown economic development. They argue that an increase in population is an opportunity rather than being a predicament for economic development. They add that resource limita-tions initiated by increased populations could be minimized by the creativity (inventiveness) of the human mind.\nThe connection between population and economic growth rates \nis intricate. Having more people provide the potential to engage abundant human labour in the production of material goods and services. Engaging large labour in the production sector likewise offers enormous economic benefits. In this context, population growth endows the potential for economic development.On the other side, if the rate of economic development exceeds the rate of growth in the human population, per-capita income will increase. Slowing-down the rate of population growth past lowering fertility rates may thus result in the “Demographic Dividend”. This means, the number of working-age population increases compared to the dependent population. The Demographic Dividend then allows investing more in health and education. It again pushes to increase labour productivity and help DCs to sustain a steady macroeconomic situation. If the working population properly engaged in production activities, production and per-capita income will rise up swiftly than in the previous.Nevertheless, the rapid falls in population growth rates were observed not to promote full potential economic development in many DCs (e.g. in Latin America and the Caribbean region). This implies that birth reduction alone never brings full development; though it potentially speeds up economic progress. Sustainable economic growth thus depends not only on fertility declines. It relies on the availability of veracious institutions, sound socio-economic policy, human capital, job opportunities, equity, and fair income and wealth distribution. Rapid population growth brings a higher youth dependency ratio and inequality. It is often linked with challenges such as chronic poverty, poor health, low education access, more hunger, and malnutrition.NOTE:"

Why is unemployment becoming such a criti -\ncal problem in society; particularly in DCs?\nBrainstorming Activity 7 .4 \na) Concepts and definitions \nEmployment: employment refers to the occupation of individuals or groups of people in certain income-making activities for earning money or useable products to satisfy personal and household livelihood needs. The occupation could be permanent or temporary depending on the type of employment. The type could be also self-employment (working in one’s own business); working in public services (through monthly wages); occupation in private companies or corporations; and/or working in any income-generating activities on a daily; monthly or annual basis. The universally regulated age of employment is \n15 years (completion of compulsory \ntraining). Nevertheless, the age limit can vary from country to country depending on the level of development. The minimum age limit for employment in Ethiopia is \n 18 years. In most \ncases, age 18 years is commonly accepted to be the minimum age of occupation by many \ncountries so as not to endanger the morale, health, and wellbeing of citizens.Unemployment: unemployment can literarily be conceived as joblessness or having no occupation to harvest money or products for supporting self-living or household livelihoods. It is the occasion when an active working person or persons lack the opportunity to get an appropriate occupation for producing livelihood support resources. \nUnemployment levels have recently been taken as signals of economic development, market \nrecital, and social wellbeing. The rates of unemployment in general terms may vary from country to country and from region to region. DCs for instance, face the highest rates of unemployment compared to MDCs. This is because DCs are characterized by higher rates of population growth and urbanization. They lack the necessary economic structure to engage the growing job demand beyond agriculture. Higher levels of unemployment could be indications of economic disaster. Lower levels of unemployment may equally be indicators of an ‘overheated economy’.Addressing youth unemployment problems in DCs like those in Africa is becoming a formidable policy contest nowadays. Large numbers of university graduates in those countries lack employment opportunities due to deficiencies in ‘employable skills’ (skill discrepancies) with the demands of the employment market."

The agricultural development activities in those countries have to be supported by non-farming enterprises. This may create economic diversification and a wide range of opportunities for youth employment.  \nUnderemployment: refers to the condition where productivity and duration of occupation \nremain below the expectations, preferences, and capacities of employed persons. It includes the inadequacy of time to cover the work (time-related underemployment); and/or incompatibility of ‘occupational skills’ and payments (inadequate employment situations) to the employed persons. Both aforementioned impressions reflect ‘under-utilization of the worker’s capacities.\nTo generalize, employment and unemployment hold the basic life affairs of individuals and \nhouseholds in society. For instance, unemployment poses distressing effects on individuals and households’ livelihoods. It upsets not only the unemployed individual but also household members as well as the broader community. Unemployment mainly distresses the living conditions of elders at the retirement age.

When soils are chemically altered, they become acidic or alkaline due to changes in Hydrogen (H\n+) and Hydroxide (OH-) ions, respectively. \nBiological degradation: biological degradation comprises the alteration of the biological mass due to human and natural causes. Natural forests can be altered by the excessive use by humans. Deforestation, overgrazing, and spraying harmful chemicals degrade forest resources. It results in the contraction of the sizes, species composition, and quality of the forest resources. 7 .2.2 The Causes of Land DegradationLand degradation is caused by natural and human factors. The natural factors include the alteration of landscapes by a volcanic eruption, flooding, and tsunami. The human factors are population pressure and anthropogenic induced climate change; improper farming practices; land use/cover changes; rapid urbanization; weak policies and institution, and unsustainable use and management of environmental resources.\n7 .2.3 Impacts of Land degradation\nLand degradation damages freshwater and marine ecosystems plus the livelihood of households and communities.  It drives climate change through the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and minimizes rates of carbon sequestration. Humans whose livelihoods directly depend on raw resources are more affected by land degradation. Those people with lower adaptation choices will be more susceptible to climate changes posed by the degradation of land resources. Land degradation and climate change cause risky livelihoods accompanied by food insecurity and poverty. In Afar the bounds of adaptation levels, land degradation, and climate change hazards instigate ever-increasing harms and unwelcomed vagaries like forced resource conflicts, poverty, and migration."

Drought \nAs can be seen from the preceding paragraph, drought is the persistent absence of rainfall that causes water shortage for certain activities. It results in hydrological imbalance and abnormal dry spells due to long periods of dry weather. As mentioned earlier, the definition of drought can vary with the variations of the intended objectives of different professions. For instance, in the science of metrology, drought is primarily defined as an extended shortfall of rainfall. Hydrological drought on the other hand relates to the under-normal water flow in the lakes, streams, and underground sources. Agricultural drought is defined as the deficit of moisture on the topsoil. This is because the absence of moisture on the topmost part of the soil af -\nfects the growth of crops. The aforementioned three drought types in combination form the environmental drought. They together lead to the imbalance between demand and supply in society; commonly named socioeconomic drought. Socioeconomic drought thus links to the supply and demand of material goods (like water, fodder, food crops, fish, and energy). It has also strong links with the features of meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts. \nDroughts are very common in arid drylands. They frequently happen in those areas through \nthe occurrences of extreme climatic events."

The underlying causes are indirect sources but play a principal role in deforestation to happen. One of these is climate change (change in rainfall levels & patterns). The other is purely anthropogenic. It includes population pressure, cultural and socioeconomic variables, and government policy types. For instance, flawed policies cause tenure insecurities, weak law enforcement, and wrong allocation of rights. Regressive cultural practices lead to unsustainable use of forest resources. Weak economic policies push poor investment patterns and promote the rate of deforestation. High population growth transpires additional demand for resources and expansion of farming to the virgin lands through the emergence of new landless households.The proximate causes are direct drivers of deforestation.

Accordingly, population-related concerns (like family size, education, and income; population and economic growth rates; unemployment and underemployment); environmental degradation and desertification; drought and famine; plus deforestation, and the worldwide digital divide were considered major current issues and each discussed separately. \nFrom the contemporary population-related concerns of our present world, family sizes, \nhousehold incomes, and education are influencing each other. Family sizes have a significant impact on household income and education access for children. Household incomes have also an influence on family nutrition and education access for children. The composition of families has a substantial impact on the well-being performance of individuals and households. Households with lower incomes often host many children. They invest very little in family nutrition and child education.  This type of family structure is very common in DCs. High population growth in the affected countries impacts the quality of life through greater dependency ratios. \nThe relation existing between population and economic growth rates is viewed as inverse \nby Malthusian and neo-Malthusian theorists. The mentioned relationship on the other hand is considered positive by anti-Malthusian theorists such as Karl Marx and Easter Boserup. Present-day realities show that DCs have experienced the highest rates of population growth accompanied by rapid urbanization and emigration. They have also limited financial resources and weak institutional capacities.  These conditions destabilize the capacity of the DCs to plan for and respond to the ‘unfolding’ population dynamics and seem to justify the Malthusian geometric theory of population growth and food production.\nEmployment and unemployment hold the basic life affairs of individuals and households in \nsociety. Unemployment poses a distressing effect on individuals and household livelihoods and communities. Unemployment problems are wider in DCs compared to the MDCs of the world. \nYouth unemployment rates are very high in those countries. A large segment of the youth \npopulation engages in defenseless jobs in the affected countries. Sound policy, economic diversification, creation of more employment options, and fair distribution of resources are among possible solutions to the problem in the DCs."

They are mainly promoted by growing population pressures on environmental resources and ecosystems. The competition for land resources (e.g. for cropland, grazing pasture, water, energy, settlement, etc.) exacerbates environmental degradation and desertification risks. Expansion of farming to marginal areas; conventional farming practices; non-responsive policies and overuse of resources are the main drivers of environmental degradation and desertification.  Unsustainable land-use practices in the drylands aggravats desertification and pushes people in poverty. This in turn minimizes the capacity to invest in sustainable environmental management and leads to the syndrome of desertification. Coupled with climate change, these practices result in droughts and famines.\nClimate change most possibly increases the incidence and harshness of meteorological and \nagricultural droughts in the drylands. Recurrent droughts, frequent floods, insect infestations, epidemics, unfair sharing of resources, conflicts and wars cause and increase the severity of famines. \nDeforestation and the digital divide are also other important geographical concerns in the \npresent time. Deforestation characterizes the clearing of forest trees through careless actions. The digital divide widens information gaps among individuals, countries, regions, cities, and businesses. Exposure to the digital gap occurs due to variation in socioeconomic, cultural, and financial resources (i.e. level of the digital economy). Nonetheless, its impact is so great for it make differences in getting opportunities and benefits.\nTo generalize, population dynamics are closely linked with national and world development \nchallenges and their solutions.

For instance, the discipline has given its name to a powerful computer-based data handling software and cartographic programs for displaying spatially referenced data. The uneven landforms, and reliefs with different heights, are represented on maps with the help of contour lines. With this background, geography can provide a real context for the use of Geographic information systems in high schools. Geographic information systems (GIS) provide powerful mapping tools for drawing, processing, and analyzing the data."

What is a relief, and what features constitute re -\nlief?\n2. How do you explain topographic maps and ways of representing relief features on maps?\nRelief is typically defined as the difference in elevation between the highest point and the \nlowest point on the landscape in meters. Earth’s surface is uneven in shape and elevation throughout the world. The physical shape or surface of the earth is referred to as a relief feature or landform of the earth. The major landforms (continents and oceanic) are formed due to the earth’s movement of crustal plates (see Unit One). Landform features are distinctive three-dimensional objects on the earth’s surface formed by erosion and deposition processes. They are also a part of the earth’s crust that has resisted erosion effectively and has remained somewhat in their original state. The landform features include plateau, escarpments, hills, mountains, volcanoes, peaks, structural domes, saddles, cliffs, valleys, gullies, washes, gorges, depressions, floodplains, and alluvial fans.8.1. Representation of relief features on topographic maps\nAt the end of this unit, you will be able to: \ndefine relief in geography and topography map;\nexamine how contour lines are used to represent relief features on maps and types of contours; and\ndraw different relief features on a topographic map.In this unit, you learn about how different landforms such as plateaus, mountains, hills, valleys, ridges, and others are represented on contour maps.

Maps are always smaller in size \nthan the environment they represent, and this reduction is expressed in terms of map scale. Map scale represents the relationship between distance on the map and their corresponding ground distance in the form of statement scale or ratio form. A Topographic Map  is a detailed and accurate illustration of natural and man-made fea -\ntures on the ground, such as water bodies, rivers, lakes, forest areas, urban and settlement areas, roads, railways, power transmission lines, contours, elevations, and other human-made features. It is a two-dimensional representation of the earth’s three-dimensional landscapes. Colors, classes of features, lines, symbols, letters, numbers, and map scale are major elements of topographic map construction. \n8.1.2. Methods of representing relief features\nHachures are short disconnected lines that represent slopes drawn in the direction of the ground slope or water flows. They commonly illustrate the steepness of slopes. The hachure lines are drawn thicker and put close together when the slopes are steep, while the hachures are spaced wide apart and thinner when the slopes are gentle. Hachures representing steep slopes are shorter than those representing gentle slopes. Initially, they were used to represent mountain ranges and peaks, plateaus, and valleys on simple sketch maps or small-scale maps. Hachures are used to show depressions and small banks or escarpments that are prominent but not high enough to be shown by the selected contour interval; and similar relief features.\nFigure 8.1 Landform relief representations by hachures"

The finer or thinner contours falling between the index contours are intermediate contours or contour lines. In most cases, there are four contour lines between index contours, and their values are calculated by dividing the difference in elevation between two consecutive index contours by five if there are four intermediate contours.\nThere are general properties of contours:\na. Contours cannot merge or cross one another on maps except at vertical cliffs, \nwaterfalls, and hanging cliffs. \nb.

A spot height is a statistical point that represents the specific altitude of a place at that particular point. Reading contours is a skill that helps us to understand the actual landscape. Contours can illustrate different types of landform reliefs, such as mountains, hills, plateaus, valleys, ridges, gorges, spurs, and others. These landform reliefs can be recognized from the shapes of their contours. \nReflective Activity 8.1:\n     \n1.

It is a rounded surface rising above its \nimmediate surroundings. From a high elevation point or hilltop, the ground slopes downward in all directions. A hill is shown on a map by contour lines forming concentric circles. A series of increasingly small, closed contours at higher elevations, with a height of less than 1,000 m indicates a hill. The inside of the smallest closed circle or contour at the highest elevation is the location of the hilltop. An inward-curving concave hillside has contours more closely spaced at the top of the hill with a progressive widening between contours downslope. An outwardly curving convex hillside has contours more widely spaced at the top of the hill and more closely spaced down the hillside. Mountain is a landmass that projects well above its \nsurroundings, higher than a hill. The closed contours with elongated shapes with increasing values towards the center with no specific tips illustrate mountain ranges.\nFigure: 8.4. Hill contours \nFigure: 8.4. Hill contours \nA long and narrow hillside or a sloping line of high ground with two or more peaks shown by \nan elliptical contour line is called a ridge. When you stand on the centerline of a ridge, you \ndo have low ground in three directions and high ground in one direction with varying degrees of slope.

The closed end of the contour line (U or V shape) always points upstream or toward high ground. Contours with “V” shapes, with upward bending and values increasing upward represent valleys. Contours in a valley are parallel to the stream until they cross it at the base of each V. The higher level the valley, the longer contour parallels the stream before crossing it. In a very flat valley, the contour may parallel the stream across the topographic map without crossing it, making it difficult to determine the direction of water flow.\nA saddle is a dip or low point between two areas of higher ground. It is not necessarily the lower ground between two hilltops; it may be simply a dip or break along a level ridge crest and lower ground in the other two high ground directions. \nFigure: 8.7 .

It is a projection of land from higher to lower ground, often formed by two rough parallel streams, which cut draws down the side of a ridge. The ground sloped down in three directions and up in one direction. Contour lines on a map depict a spur with the U or V directing away from the high ground.

Fills are shown on a map when they are at least 10 feet high, and they are drawn with a contour line along the fill line. This contour line extends the length of the filled area and has tick marks that point toward the lower ground. If the map scale permits, the length of the fill tick marks are drawn to scale and extend from the baseline of the fill symbol.\n8.1.4. Catchment representation on contour map\nA drainage basin/catchment area refers to the entire geographical space that is drained by the major river and its tributaries. A drainage system is a system that is made up of all the river basins that flow in the same direction. The major river in a river basin is the longest of all the rivers in the basin. The other small streams that supply water to the main rivers are called tributaries. The point at which the tributaries meet with the major river is called confluence. The point at which the major river in a basin starts is called the source of the river. Likewise, the point at which the river empties itself into an ocean, a sea, or a lake is called the mouth of the river. A drainage basin and its watershed can be identified on a contour map. This can be done by observing the patterns and shapes of the contour lines that are used to represent the topography of the mapped area. \nSome rules are considered when using contour lines to determine watershed boundaries. \nThese include, a contour line never going up or downhill, contour lines never crossing each other,  the steeper the slope the closer together the contour lines, and the rules of the “V”s.  Water flows down on all sides of the hill. Water flows from the top of the saddle or ridge.The following steps can help you identify a drainage basin and its divide on contour maps.\nFirst identify the course of the main river and the outlet point of the watershed \non the map, and then draw a circle at the outlet or downstream points of the watershed.

Basic Concepts of Geographical Information System (GIS)\n8.2.1. Definition and Importance of GIS\nAt the end of this section, you will be able to:\ndescribe the basic concepts of GIS;\nexplain the importance of GIS;\nA geographical Information System (GIS) is a computer-based system for capturing, preparing, \nstoring, checking, retrieving, manipulating, analyzing, and displaying geographically referenced data or geospatial data. GIS integrates hardware, software, and geospatial data to analyze relationships, patterns, and trends in the form of maps, and charts to support decision-making for planning and management of land use, natural resources, environment, transportation, urban facilities, and other administrative records.\nGIS can be applicable in environmental science and social science, including population, \npublic health, crime study, and market planning. One of the major benefits of GIS is that it provides a platform to integrate complex and diverse information into a simple and illustrative a map. A GIS can be used to merge diverse data sources, such as project-specific information, socio-economic data, census, and statistical and spatial base data (administrative boundaries, roads, cities, infrastructure, etc.). A GIS is also used to manage critical data and to inform the decision-making process. It provides a platform for project planning, monitoring, reporting, and data sharing, as well as for visualizing and disseminating information.\nThe potential for using GIS to promote teaching and learning in Geography within schools \nis considerable. GIS has immense importance to address fundamental problems and issues, such as climate change, increasing food production, vanishing natural resources, and natural disasters. It is important to address local geographical issues or problems, such as the siting of facilities (schools, hospitals, and retail development), the management of emergency services, and the conservation of natural resources. \n           Consider these points:\n1.

Most of the time, GIS is applied for the mapping and analysis of network services, suitable sites for urban development, transport management, suitable agriculture, disaster management, planning and community development, irrigation management, and wildlife management. It is important to examine the spatial relationship between deprivation and crime in parts of a city, determine the rate and extent of vegetation destruction, determine the relationship between rock type and relief in an area, and identify areas with a high risk of slope erosion in a region. \n8.2.2.

The hardware consists of the technical equipment needed to run a GIS task. The hardware part is divided into two: i.e. Input and Output. The input includes a computer with high capacity in terms of processor speed, memory, and data storage capacity. GIS runs on a wide range of hardware types from centralized computer servers to desktop computers used in a standalone or networked configuration. Global position systems (GPS), mobile phones, scanners, and digitizers are also included in the input part of the hardware.  The output port of the hardware includes the printer, plotter, and hard disc."

One popular software application is ArcGIS. \nThe ArcGIS desktop environment includes ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcScene, and ArcGlobe \napplications. A very capable open-source (free) GIS software is QGIS. It encompasses most of the functionality included in ArcGIS. The key software components are database management systems (DBMS), tools for the input and manipulation of geographic information, and tools that support geographic query, analysis, and visualization.

There are \ntwo main methods used to store data in a GIS: Raster images and vectors. Rasters are used \nfor the storage of aerial photographs and imagery of various kinds. In raster data format each object is represented in the form of a cell /grid and it has a separate reflectance value /color/. The data type consists of rows and columns of cells, with each cell storing a single value. The resolution of the raster data set is its cell width in ground units. Rasters are used to represent continuous layers, such as elevation, slope and aspect, soil, vegetation, temperature, rainfall, and so on. ArcGIS can utilize raster data formats, such as jpg, tiffs, etc.\nSpatial data refer to the shape, size, location, and orientation of geographical feature. They \nare generally multi-dimensional and autocorrelated. In a GIS, geographical features are often expressed as a vector representing discreet data. \nDifferent geographical features are expressed by different types of geometry. For instance, \ngeographical features, such as wells, airports cities, schools, and health posts can be expressed by a single zero-dimensional point. There is no measurement of point features. Geographical features, including rivers, roads, railroads, trails, and others are expressed by one-dimensional lines or polylines. Line features can measure distance. Geographical features that cover a particular area of the earth’s surface, including lakes, national parks, administration boundaries, watershed boundaries, buildings, or land uses are represented by two-dimensional polygons. Polygon features can measure perimeter and area. Data consisting of a single feature geometry type can be stored in the Shapefile format. A collection of feature classes such as points, polylines, and polygons within a geodatabase that shares a common coordinate system is called a feature dataset. Vector data are excellent for capturing and storing spatial details. Geographical or spatial data can be acquired from existing data in paper form through digitizing or scanning, survey data by the use of a global position system (GPS), and remotely sensed data/Arial Photography and Satellite images/. \nNon-spatial data or attributes are associated with the feature but independent of all \ngeometric considerations. Non-spatial data can also be stored along with the spatial data \nrepresented by the coordinates of a vector geometry or the position of a raster cell. Attribute data are additional characteristics of the spatial data or the features. For example, non-spatial data that they are independent of the location of the lake but describe further characteristics of the lakes, including lakes depth, water quality, pollution level, name, area, volume, and others. Data input in GIS contains entering the spatial data, and non-spatial data, and linking the two together."

Opening, Saving and Closing ArcMap Documents\nArcMap is a program in which we add data, make maps, perform analysis, edit GIS data, access Arc catalog and ArcToolbox, use geoprocessing tools, integrate GPS field data, etc. It is the primary application and interface associated with ArcGIS software. \nMap Exchange Documents (MXD)  are ArcMap document files that contain a map, specify \nthe GIS data used (including pointers to the file location for each dataset), display information \n(symbology and labeling), and other elements used in ArcMap. An ArcMap document does not store data but rather only refers to the data you use. When you “Add Data” to your map document, you only add a reference to the original data source.\nHow do you open ArcMap?\nThe ArcMap application is accessible by single clicking on the ArcMap Icon in your start menu to open the software. You can double-click an ArcMap document (.mxd file) on desktop short cut to start ArcMap with the desired map.  By default, ArcMap begins with a new, empty map document.\nHow do you save a map in ArcMap?\nAfter you finish working on a map, you can save it and exit ArcMap. You save a map as a document and store it on your hard disk. ArcMap automatically appends a file extension (.mxd) to your map document name. You will need to provide a name and save it into a folder location if you haven't saved the map before. You can also save the map with its data using a map package, which can be used to share your map and its related data with other users.\nHow do you close an opened map in ArcMap?\nClick the File menu and click Close. Opening a new map also closes the current map.\n8.3.2. ArcMap Main Tools and their Role\nConsider the following question on your own:\nHow do you distinguish between ArcCatalog, Arc -\nToolbox, Toolsets and tools?"

A toolbox cannot contain another toolbox. The common toolboxes present within ArcToolbox are:\nAnalysis Toolbox provides a powerful set of tools to perform various geoprocessing \noperations, such as overlays, create buffers, calculate statistics, and perform proximity analysis of all types of vector data.\nCartography Toolbox designed to produce data and support map production for \nspecific maps in a way that meets a specific cartographic standard.\nConversion Toolbox contains tools that convert data between various formats. \nCoverage Toolbox contains a powerful set of tools to perform various geoprocessing \noperations that only use coverage as input and will only output data as coverage.  \nData management Toolbox contains a rich and varied collection of tools that are \nused to develop, manage, and maintain features classes, datasets, layers; and raster data structures are grouped in this toolbox.\nGeocoding Toolbox contains tools to assist in accomplishing common geocoding \ntasks such as, creation, maintenance, and deletion of address locators, as well as the actual geocoding of addresses.\nLinear Referencing Toolbox contains a series of tools for creating, calibrating, and \ndisplaying the data used for linear referencing.\nSpatial Analyst Toolbox contains tools to create, query, map, and analyze cell-based \nraster data; perform integrated raster/vector analysis; derive new information from existing data; query information across multiple data layers; and fully integrate cell-based raster data with traditional vector data sources.\nToolsets are a logical container of tools and other toolsets. Tools are a single geoprocessing operation, including dialog, models and scripts. A tool can be stored at toolbox level or within the toolset. Presence of Tools depends on the Extensions available. All the Toolboxes, Toolsets and Tools within the ArcToolbox are sorted alphabetically. \nArcCatalog is primarily used as a file manager, and to develop metadata for our GIS data. \nMetadata is information that explains your data to people who may want to use it and understand the different field attributes associated with the data set, the data projection, how the data set was created, any analysis performed on the data set, etc.  There are two ways to access ArcCatalog: as a standalone application from the start menu or your desktop."

Adding, Removing and Displaying Data\na. Adding Data\nOne of the first steps performed when creating a new map document is to add GIS data. This data could be local data that you have previously created, or have been provided with; these formats could include shapefile, geodatabase, tabular data, or others. In addition, data can be sourced from the internet through data providers or streamed through online data services. There are two primary methods of adding data to your opened ArcMap Document. The first \nmethod is to use the ArcCatalog Window, browse your data, and drag and drop the file into \nyour project. The second method is to use the Add Data button. To add data, we use the \nadditional data pull-down menu which has three commands. Add Data opens the add data dialog box, where you can add local data, or connect to a known data server or service. Add \nBasemap opens the base map dialog box, where you can select from a variety of pre-made base maps published by ESRI and other groups. Add Data from ArcGIS Online  opens the \nArcGIS Online portal, allowing you to browse through numerous base maps and data services provided by any number of groups.\nReflective Activity 8.3: \n     \n1.

Click Add Data, browse to and select the data you want to add, and then click Add. Once the data are added, you will notice that the data layers are placed into the Table of Contents (TOC) in a specific order. They are organized in the TOC by geometry type: Point features are on top of line features, which are on top of polygon features, and polygon features would be on top of raster datasets.\nb. Removing Data \nThe instruction to remove data is given as follow. First locate the file you wish to remove in the Table of Contents in ArcMap. The Table of Contents is the list of data layers that appears on the left side of the ArcMap window. Secondly, make right-click on the file name for the layer that you wish to remove and a context menu will appear. Choose Remove from the menu.\nc. Displaying Data\nMaps can be displayed in data view and layout view. Each view allows you to view and interact with the map in different ways. Data view provides a geographic window for exploring, displaying, and querying the data on your map. You work in real-world coordinates and measurements in data view. Layout view allows working with the map layout elements, such as titles, north arrows and scale bars, and along with the data frame, arranged on a page. In layout view, you work primarily in page space (typically, inches or centimeters) except when you are interacting with a data frame in your layout. An alternative way to switch your display is to click View > Data View or View > Layout View from the main menu in ArcMap.\nReflective Activity 8.4 \n     \n1.

Hachures are small straight lines drawn on the map along the direction of maximum slope, running across the contours. They are used in combination with contour lines to illustrate escarpments, depressions, and craters. Contours are an imaginary collection of lines connecting places having equal elevation on the ground surface above a datum, showing mountains, valleys and landforms.  Contour lines forming concentric circles on the map represent a hill. \nThe closed contours with elongated shapes with increasing values towards the center with no specific \ntips illustrate mountain ranges. A long and narrow hillside or a sloping line of high ground with two or more peaks shown by an elliptical contour line is called a ridge. Contours with “V” shapes, with upward bending and values increasing upward represent valleys. On maps, depressions are represented by closed contours with more or less circular shapes that have tick marks pointing towards the low ground. Contoured depressions are different from hills by short ticks at right angles to the contours, pointing towards the center of the depression. An elevated land represented by closed contours roughly rectangular in shape with increasing values towards the center is a plateau.\nContours with “U or V” shapes, with downward bending and values increasing upward represent \nspurs. The contour lines on the slope merge into a single contour or are shown very close together to represent cliffs. Contour lines extend the length of the filled area and have tick marks that point toward lower ground. A contour topographic map can be produced using a Geographic information system (GIS).\nGIS is a computer-based system for capturing, preparing, manipulating, analyzing, and displaying \ngeospatial data. Working with GIS helps to integrate hardware, software, data, people, and methods. ArcMap is one of the applications of the ArcGIS desktop environment. ArcMap is a program in which we add data, make maps, perform analysis, access Arc catalog and ArcToolbox, use geoprocessing tools, integrate GPS field data, etc. The ArcMap application is accessible by single-clicking on the ArcMap Icon in your Start Menu to open the software. The ArcMap display window contains menu tools, ArcToolbox, ArcCatalog, and others. Once the ArcMap is opened, adding GIS data is one of the first steps performed when creating a new map document. Spatial data is added to the data view displaying window. The added data can be analyzed using different geoprocessing tools and tools from ArcToolbox. Layout view allows working with the map layout elements, such as titles, north arrows, and scale bars, along with the data frame, arranged on a page."
