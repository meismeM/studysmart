Of either a physical or \ncultural phenomenon, geographers enquire: What is it? Where is it? How did it come to be what and where it is? Where is it in relation to other physical or cultural realities that affect it or affected by it? How is it part of a functioning whole? How does its location affect people’s lives and the content of the area in which it is found? These questions form the core of the enquiry skills which are, in turn, believed to be the main contribution of Geography to the development of core skills in 21st century.\nIn the textbook the contents and description are organized and developed based on \nfundamental and unifying themes in Geography. These mainly focus on physical aspects, human-environment interaction, contemporary Geographical issues, Geographic enquiry and map making.  These promote arguments and use of evidence in day-to-day lives in the process of developing knowledge, skill, values and attitudes. Besides, variety of strategies are addressed to create a range of learning opportunities in the topics suited to the need of all learners by following a thematic approach of the study in Geography. \nThe physical environmental aspects focused on geological processes associated with plate \ntectonics and resulted land features as well as concept and related basic issues of climate change. The human-environment interaction addresses the issues of sustainable devel-opment in relation to natural resource use and management as well as population and socio-economic development. In connection with this, challenges related to economic development and solutions to environmental and sustainability problems are treated in the textbook. Besides, the climate change, desertification, drought and famine topics are addressed as the contemporary Geographical issues. Finally, fundamental of research in Geography as an enquiry and GIS data and map making using GIS are addressed in the textbook.   \nV"

Such a knowledge would enable humanity to minimize the damage from moderate forces, and to avoid total collapse during the occurrence of these forces. \nWe hope that you remember from the previous grades lessons about the geological history of \nEthiopia and the formation of the earth’s continents. This is a continuation of these lessons on related matters. This unit particularly deals with the theories of continental drift, plate tectonic, geological processes and the landforms caused by these processes.  \nKEY TERMS: Continental Drift, Pangaea, Laurasia, Gondwanaland\nThe Continental drift theory presupposes that the earth’s continents have moved over geologic time relative to each other; thus, appearing to have “drifted” across the ocean bed. The continental drift theory suggests that the present continents were formed from a single continent called PANGAEA. During the Carboniferous period, some 350 million years ago, Pangaea was located around the South Pole. \nIn the Triassic period of Mesozoic era, Pangaea started to break into several parts. The \nnorthern part of Pangaea is known as LAURASIA. The southern part of Pangaea is known as GONDWANALAND. Both continents are further subdivided into the present continents. Through the process of drifting, the continents reached their present location. This process of \ncontinental drift as a whole took place over  millions of years.1. Do you remember how the continents were \nformed? \n2. What forces are responsible for their forma -\ntion?\n1.1 THE CONTINENTAL DRIFT THEORY\nAt the end of this section, you will be able to:\nÞ identify the continents that constituted Laurasia and Gondwanaland;\nÞ explain the geological evidences that support continental drift theory;\nÞ explain why Alfred Wegener continental drift theory was not easily accepted; and\nÞ describe how continental drift theory and plate tectonics are related.Brainstorming Activity 1.1"

One of the basic concepts that helped Wegener’s continental drift theory the idea of a large united landmass consisting of most of the Earth’s continental regions. In his theory, Wegener introduced the supercontinent of Pangaea to explain the ancient climate similarities, fossil evidence and similarity of rock structures between Africa and South America, as well as the outlines of the continents, especially the continental shelves, which seem to fit together (Figure 1.2). Thus, Wegener used the following geological evidence, among others, to support his theory:\n1. Coastline Similarity: The coastlines of Africa and South America have remarkable similarity \nin opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean. These coastlines fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.Figure1.1: Continental Drift"

Paleoclimatic Evidence: similarity of climatic data reconstructed from rock structure are \nsimilar in the present continents. \nWhy was Wegener ’s continental drift theory not easily accepted? Do you know any other research findings that could be easily accepted by the scientific community?Wegener’s theory of continental drift was rejected by scientific community of the time. The main reasons for this rejection were:\n1. Wegener was not a geologist by profession, which of course was most welcome by his opponents. \n2. Most influential geoscientists at that time were based in the Northern Hemi -\nsphere, whereas most of the conclusive data came from the Southern Hemisphere. \n3. Wegener thought that Pangaea did not break up until Cenozoic era, and scientists found it hard to believe that so much continental drift could have occurred in so short a time. \n4. The greatest problem remained the lack of direct evidence for the movements of continents and the needed explanation for the mechanism.\nRegardless of the controversies mentioned above, perhaps Wegener’s most important legacy is to have introduced the idea of lateral mobility of continents, that is, offering a paradigm change from fixism to mobilism to the scientific community and the public. Hence, the theory ignited a new way of viewing the Earth that led some scientists to start searching for an expla -\nnation of how continents could move.\n1.2 PLATE TECTONICS THEORY\nAt the end of this section, you will be able to:\nÞ explain what plate tectonic theory states;\nÞ identify the major tectonic plates and their boundaries;\nÞ draw a diagram to demonstrate the movement of  plates;.\nÞ identify the major continental and oceanic plates; and  \nÞ explain how geological processes and plate boundaries affect human lives. \nKEY TERMS: Plate tectonics, Plate boundary, Asthenosphere, Lithosphere\n1.

According to plate tectonic theory, the layer, called the asthenosphere, allows the uppermost mantle and crust, together called the lithosphere to slide across the top of it. Earth’s lithosphere is broken into about a dozen large pieces (plus some smaller ones), called plates (Figure 1.4).These plates move slowly at a rate of a few centimeters per year and change size. Plates may be entirely made up of continental rocks, both continental and oceanic rocks, or entirely of oceanic rocks. \nPlate tectonics is a theory developed in the late 1960s to explain how the outer layers of the \nearth move and deform. The theory has caused a revolution in the way we think about the earth. Since the development of the plate tectonics theory, geologists have had to re-examine almost every aspect of Geology. The theory states that the earth’s lithosphere is divided into plates that move around on the top of the asthenosphere. Continental crust is embodied within the lithospheric plate. The plates move in different directions, and meet each other at plate boundaries. Plate tectonics has been proven to be so useful that it can predict geologic events and explain almost all aspects of what we see on the earth.\nFigure 1.4: Lithosphere and Asthenosphere\nFigure 1.4: Lithosphere and Asthenosphere\nDo you think the edge of African plate corresponds to the boundary of the continent?The edges of these plates do not necessarily correspond to the boundaries of continents or oceans. For example, the North American Plate includes the western half of the North Atlantic Ocean’s seafloor. (Figure 1.5)"

Continental crust, made largely of granite, is less dense than oceanic crust made largely of basalt. As the plates move, they may:        1.  Converge, or come together; forming convergent (Destructive) boundary;\n        2. Diverge, or spread apart; forming divergent (Constructive) boundary or         3. Slide past each other along fractures called transform (Conservative) boundary.\nConvergent plate boundaries\nThese are boundaries where two plates move toward each other. At such boundaries, the denser plate will be forced under, or subducted beneath, the less dense one. The subducted crust is eventually destroyed. This happens when oceanic crust meets continental crust and when oceanic crust meets another oceanic crust. For example, the eastward-moving NazcaPlate, under the southeastern Pacific Ocean, is being subducted under the westward moving South American Plate. The denser oceanic crust is pushed down into the mantle, causing it to melt and produce magma (molten rock). The magma and gases rise to the surface, and are vented through the western crust of South America, forming the volcanoes of the Andes Mountains.1.3.

The Mariana Islands of the western Pacific Ocean were formed this way.\nTwo blocks of continental crust may converge as well. The resulting pressure can deform the \ncrust. If one block is denser, that block may slide under the other, mainly lifting the other plate rather than sinking too much itself. A good example of this is the convergence of the northward moving Indo-Australian Plate with the Eurasian Plate. Thus, as India met Asia, the collision produced the highest mountain range on Earth: the Himalayas.\nDivergent plate boundary\nThis occurs where plates move away from each other at oceanic ridges, such as in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. There, rising magma from underlying asthenosphere intrude and erupt beneath and at oceanic ridge to create a new seafloor. This pushes the plates on either side away from each other in opposite directions. \nUndersea volcanoes and crust expanded by heating have produced a long undersea ridge, \nbut with a rift in the middle where the plates are separating. This process is known as seafloor spreading. Shallow earthquakes are common at oceanic ridges. \nDivergence can also happen on continents, producing fractures called rift valleys. A modern example is the East African Rift Valley. Over millions of years, the continental crust may sepa -\nrate completely, with the area between flooding with water to become a new ocean.\nTransform Fault boundaries\nIn some places, plates slide past each other laterally along fractures in the crust. These places are called transform faults. The plates stick and then occasionally slip, producing earthquakes.Figure1.7: Diverging Plates"

Although there is some debate among geoscientists as to the exact mechanism, most agree that motion of the plates is ultimately driven by convection currents in the mantle.Recall that convection is a means of heat transfer wherein the heat moves with the material. It occurs when conduction is inefficient at transporting heat, particularly if the material has a low thermal conductivity, like rocks.Recall also that the Earth's asthenosphere is ductile, and therefore is likely to flow more readily (it will bend or deform if you apply enough force to it) than the overlying lithosphere.\nFigure 1.9: Convection currents in the Asthenosphere\nFigure 1.9: Convection currents in the Asthenosphere"

Have you ever thought as to how these landforms were formed? What are the factors which are responsible for their formation?\nInternal forces are forces that come from the inside of the earth. These forces create irregularities \nor unevenness on the face of the earth. They form ups and downs on the crust of the earth by breaking, bending, or folding the rock. Let us briefly examine some of them: folding, faulting, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\nFOLDING\nFolding occurs when rock layers are pushed by earth movements sideways. The movement may be only from one direction. It may also be from two directions. When rock layers are pushed from two directions, they are compressed. The rock layers are folded (Figure 1.10). The layers of rock bend up from an upfold or anticline. Those which bend down form a downward arch or syncline. The Earth is a dynamic planet. Geological processes occur constantly, some of them going on \ninvisible for us; while others causing a great damage. The term \"geological processes\" describes the natural forces that shape the physical makeup of our planet earth. Plate tectonics, erosion, chemical weathering and sedimentation are all examples of forces that significantly affect the Earth’s surface and account for its major features. \nThe geological processes are closely studied by geologists and earth scientists to:\n¿ Improve the understanding of the planet’s history;  \n¿ Help to locate useful resources, such as metal ores; and \n¿ Aid the prediction of potentially disastrous events, such as earthquakes, tsunamis \nand volcanic eruptions.\nSome of the geological processes bring about changes on the surface of the earth. The forces that bring about changes on the earth’s surface are divided into two. They are: \n 1. Endogenic forces\n  2. Exogenic forces.\nThe forces which derive their strength from the earth’s exterior or originate within the earth’s \natmosphere are called exogenic forces or external forces.  The endogenic forces, also called internal forces, are used to describe pressure that originates inside the earth."

The shifting of the rock releases a great amount of energy, sending out shock waves that travel through the rock, and cause the ground to shake. These shock waves, called seismic waves by Earth scientists, may be powerful enough to alter the surface, thrusting up cliffs and opening great cracks in the ground. Earthquakes occur most often along geologic faults, which are fractures in the rocks of Earth’s crust. Along faults, the rock masses on opposite sides of the fracture strain against each other and sometimes “slip,” causing an earthquake. \nThe major fault lines of the world are located at the fringes of the huge tectonic plates that \nmake up the crust. Earthquakes, called temblors by scientists, occur almost continuously. Fortunately, most of them can be detected only by sensitive instruments called seismographs. A scale is used for reading it. It is called a Richter scale. It gives reading from 0 (no movement) to 9 (extremely severe). The Richter scale measures the effect in a logarithmic scale. The effects of an earthquake increases significantly for each step up the scale. (Figure 1.13).\nFigure1.13: Richter scale\nCauses of EarthquakesMost of the worst earthquakes are associated with changes in the shape of Earth’s outermost shell, particularly the crust. These earthquakes are generated by the rapid release of strain energy that is stored within the rocks of the crust. The strongest and the most destructive quakes are associated with ruptures of the crust, which are known as faults. Although faults are present in most regions of the world, earthquakes are not associated with all of them. (The kilogram of Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 megajoules, which \nis approximately the amount of energy released in the detonation of one kilogram of TNT.)"

In a great earthquake, shocks may be felt by people thousands of miles or kilometers away from the center. Seismographs can pick up the waves on the other side of the world. There are two broad classes of seismic waves: \nBody waves and surface waves.\nBody waves travel within the body of the Earth. They include P, or primary waves and S, or \nsecondary waves. P waves spread in the crust from the point of rupture, which is called the focus of the earthquake. The point of which the wave originates is what we call the Earthquake focus. The point on the Earth’s surface immediately above the focus is termed the epicenter of an earthquake. P waves alternately compress and expand the rock through which they pass, and vibrate in the same direction in which the waves travel. \nS waves  vibrate at right angles to the direction of wave travel. These secondary waves are \nthe location of an earthquake many thousands of miles away. After both P and S waves have \nmoved through the body of the Earth, they are followed by two types of surface waves, which travel along the Earth’s surface. These are named Love and Rayleigh waves, after the scientists who identified them. Because of their larger amplitude, surface waves are responsible for much of the destructive shaking that occurs far from the epicenter. Surface waves, which travel more slowly than body waves, are the most powerful shake waves.\n1.1 4 Focus and Epicenter of an  Earthquake"

A Benioff zone extends down along the plate that is being subducted. \nVolcanism:\nVolcanism is the process by which molten rock or magma, together with gaseous and solid materials is forced out on the surface of the earth. This movement could be very slow or sudden. With slow movement, the materials could spread over the surrounding area gently. If the movement is violent, the materials will be thrown high into the sky and then fall back in the surface of the earth. Magma may reach the surface of the earth through two types of openings:  1. Vents and  2. FissuresVents are holes or openings like a pipe throw which magma flows out into the surface of the earth. If lava emerges via vent, it builds up a volcano (a cone shaped mound).Fissures are large and narrow cracks or fractures in a rock. Molten materials may move upward along the cracks and spread out over the surroundings. If the lava emerges via a fissure, it builds up a plateau. During the formation of lava plateau, there is little or no explosive activity through the fissures;  lava gently spreads over large area.VolcanoesThe word volcano refers to the form or structure, usually conical, produced by accumulations of erupted material. In some volcanic eruptions, the molten rock called magma when it is underground and lava when it reaches the surface, flows slowly out of the vent. OccurrenceVolcanoes occur mainly near the boundaries of tectonic plates. They form along belts of tension, where plates diverge, and along belts of compression, where plates converge. Nearly 1,900 volcanoes are active today or are known to have been active in historical times. Of these, almost 90 percent are situated in the Pacific Ring of Fire (Figure .18)."

But rain water dissolves oxygen and carbon dioxide as it falls through the atmosphere. Therefore, such water is not pure. Some minerals like iron will rust when they become in contact with rainwater that has dissolved oxygen from the atmosphere. Rusting makes iron weak and breakable. Minerals that have carbonates are dissolved when they come in contact with rainwater that has carbonic acid. Limestone is one example.Solution - removal of rock in solution by acidic rainwater. In particular, limestone is weathered by rainwater containing dissolved CO2, (this process is sometimes called carbonation). Hydrolysis - the breakdown of rock by acidic water to produce clay and soluble salts.\nChemical weathering is most active in limestone. When water flows between layers of limestone, \nit dissolves and erodes parts of the rock and forms holes. These holes become larger and wider as they continue to be eroded. Finally, very large underground water holes called caves are formed. Rivers that pass through limestone areas often flows underground through caves, e.g. Weyb river in Bale or Sof Omar (Figure1.26).In underground cave, water passes slowly through the roof of the cave. Thus, a drop of water (now a solution) hangs to the ceiling of the cave. When the drop of water falls, small amounts of the solution is left as a deposit on the ceiling. After a long time, these small deposits build up to form a limestone column that hangs down from the ceiling. This is known as stalactite.  The water drops that falls from the ceiling form small deposits on the floor. These deposits slowly build upward and form other limestone columns from the floor. We call these stalagmites. After a long time, a stalactite hanging down from the ceiling may join with a stalagmite growing upward to form a pillar. Thus, the ceiling and the floor of the cave are connected by such pillars (Figure 1.26).\nFigure1.26: Stalagmites and stalactites in Sof Omar Cave in Ethiopia"

Running water flowing along a steep slope is very powerful. Therefore, it can wear and tear the land surface strongly. As a result, large amount of rock materials are removed from the slope and then transported elsewhere. On the other hand, the rate of erosion by running water also depends on vegetation cover. Areas that have rich vegetation cover are less affected by erosion.\nRunning water results in different types of landforms (Figure1.27). Some of them are the \nfollowing:Landform associated with runoff: they occur by the erosion activity of surface water moving down a slope or across a field. This type of erosion includes:Sheet erosion: It occurs when surface water moves in a wide flow. This moving water erodes top soil evenly. This type of erosion may not be noticeable until much damage has been done. Rill erosion: It occurs when surface water cuts small channels or ditches in the soil.

The causes of earth movements include convection current and isostatic movements.The surface of the earth is changed by internal and external forces. Plate tectonic process profoundly influences the composition of the atmosphere and oceans, serving as a prime cause of long term climate change, and makes significant contribution to the chemical and physical environment in which life evolves.Today, science has shown that the surface of the Earth is in a constant state of change.Earthquakes often cause dramatic changes on the Earth’s surface. A volcano is a vent, or opening, in the Earth’s surface through which molten rock, gases, and ash erupt.Mass Wasting refers to the down slope movements of rock, regolith, and soil under the influence of gravity. Denudation is the lowering of the land by wearing away the surface of the earth. Soil erosion is the movement of soil and rock particles from one place to another.UNIT SUMMARY"

Climate refers to the conditions of the atmosphere in a certain place over many years. For example, the climate in Gondar is cold in the winter, and the climate in Gambella is warm and humid all year long.

When scientists talk about \nglobal climate change, they are talking about the global climate and a pattern of change that’s happening over many years. \nOne of the most important trends that scientists look at is the average temperature of the \nEarth, which has been increasing for many years. This is called global warming. Rising global temperatures lead to other changes around the world, such as stronger hurricanes, melting glaciers, and the loss of wildlife habitats. This is because the Earth’s air, water, and land are all interdependent and prone to the climate change. This means a change in one place can lead to other changes somewhere else. For example, when air temperatures rise, the oceans absorb more heat from the atmosphere and become warmer. Warmer oceans, in turn, can cause stronger storms as shown in Figure 2:1\nFigure 2:1 Global warming leading to a variety of changes.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. It refers to any change in climate overtime, due to either natural variability or human activities.Thanks to the work of the IPCC and other groups of scientists working on the definition of climate change, we now better understand the consequences of this phenomenon in our lives. In the minds of many, climate change is a relatively distant problem that simply implies that it will get hotter. Nevertheless, the consequences are much deeper and should be taken more seriously."

They are known as greenhouse gases (GHGs) because they trap heat and raise air temperatures near the ground, acting like a greenhouse on the surface of the planet.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pointed out in its 2001 Third \nAssessment Report on the state of the global climate that an increasing body of observations gave a collective picture of a warming world and other changes in the climate system.

Glaciers are melting, sea level is rising, precipitation is becoming more intense in many areas, and global temperature is increasing each decade. Climate change, whether driven by natural or human forcing, can lead to changes in the likelihood of the occurrence or strength of extreme weather and climate events or both.\n The primary cause of climate changes over the last few decades is human (anthropogenic) \nactivity, mainly the burning of fossil fuels. , Evidently climate has changed in the past, and nothing suggests that it will not continue to change, both globally and locally. As the urban environment changes, its climate differs from that of the region around it. Sometimes the difference is striking, as when city nights are warmer than the nights of the outlying rural areas. Other times, the difference is subtle, as when a layer of smoke and haze covers a city. \nIn this chapter, we will first look at the evidence for climate change in the past; then we will \ninvestigate the causes of climate change from both natural processes and human activity. IPCC has produced the world’s most comprehensive reports on climate change for more than 25 years. It published in-depth climate assessments in 1990, 1995, 2001, 2007 , 2013, and again in 2021. The 2013, Fifth Assessment Report, states that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-twentieth cen -\ntury. In the report, “extremely likely” means a probability of at least 95 percent.\nClimate Change Caused by Natural Events\nWhat are the natural causes of climate change? There are three “external” causes of climate change. These are changes in: \n1. Incoming solar radiation;\n2. The composition of the atmosphere; and3. The Earth’s surface.\nNatural phenomena can cause climate to change by all the three mechanisms, whereas human activities can change climate by the second and third mechanisms.1.

For example, if temperature changes, many other elements may be altered as well. The interactions among the atmosphere, the oceans, and the ice are extremely complex and the number of possible interactions among these systems is enormous. No climatic element within the system is isolated from the others, which is why the complete picture of the Earth’s changing climate is not totally understood. With this in mind, we will first investigate how feedback systems work; then we will consider some of the current theories as to why the Earth’s climate changes naturally.\nVariations in the Earth’s Orbit: \nA theory ascribing climatic changes to variations in the Earth’s orbit is the Milankovitch theory, named after the name of astronomer Milutin Milankovitch, who first proposed the idea in the 1930s. The basic idea of this theory is that, as the Earth travels through space, three separate cyclic movements combine to produce variations in the amount of solar energy that reaches the Earth. The Milankovitch cycles that combine to produce variations in solar radiation re -\nceived at the Earth’s surface include: \nc Changes in the shape (eccentricity) of the Earth’s orbit about the sun. \nc Precession of the Earth’s axis of rotation, or wobbling. \nc Changes in the tilt (obliquity) of the Earth’s axis.\nWhat are the Milankovitch Cycles? Natural global warming, and cooling, is considered to be initiated by Milankovitch cycles. These orbital and axial variations influence the initiation of climate change in long-term natural cycles of ‘ice ages’ and ‘warm periods’ known as ‘glacial’ and ‘interglacial’ periods. Our current climate forcing shows we are outside of that natural cycle forcing range.\n41\ncycle forcing range.\nFigure 2:4 Milankovitch Cycle"

Evidently, the greater number of bright areas around the sunspots radiate more energy, which offsets the effect of the dark spots. \nAtmospheric Particles\nMicroscopic liquid and solid particles (aerosols) that enter the atmosphere from both natural \nand human-induced sources can have an effect on climate. The effect of these particles on the climate is exceedingly complex, and depends upon a number of factors, such as the particle’s size, shape, color, chemical composition, and vertical distribution above the surface.  In this section, we will examine those particles that enter the atmosphere through natural means.Particles near the surface: Particles can enter the atmosphere in a variety of natural ways. For example, wildfires can produce abundant amounts of tiny smoke particles, and dust storms sweep tons of fine particles into the atmosphere. Flaming volcanoes can release significant quantities of sulfur-rich aerosols into the lower atmosphere. Although the effect of these particles on the climate system is complex, the overall effect they have is to cool the surface of the earth by preventing sunlight from reaching the surface.\nFigure 2.5: Solar cycleVariations in Solar OutputSolar energy measurements made by sophisticated instruments aboard satellites show that the sun’s energy output (called brightness) varies slightly by a fraction of 1 percent with sunspot activity. Sunspots are huge magnetic storms on the sun that show up as cooler (darker) regions on the sun’s surface. They occur in cycles, with the number and size reaching a maximum approximately every 1 1 years. The Figure 2.4 illuminates this better."

During volcanic eruptions, fine par -\nticles of ash and dust (as well as gases) can be ejected into the atmosphere. Scientists agree that the volcanic eruptions having the greatest impact on climate are those rich in sulfur gases. These gases, when ejected into the stratosphere, combine with water vapor in the presence of sunlight to produce tiny, reflective sulfuric acid particles that grow in size, forming a dense layer of haze. The haze may reside in the stratosphere for several years, absorbing and reflect -\ning back to space a portion of the sun’s incoming energy. The reflection of incoming sunlight by the haze tends to cool the air at Earth’s surface, especially in the hemisphere where the eruption occurs.\nHuman (Anthropogenic) Induced Climate Change\nEarlier in this chapter, we saw how variations in atmospheric CO\n2 may have contributed to \nchanges in the global climate spanning thousands and even millions of years. Today, we are modifying the chemistry and characteristics of the atmosphere by injecting into it vast quantities of particles and greenhouse gases without fully understanding the long-term consequences. In this section, we will first look at how gases and particles injected into the lower atmosphere by human activities may be affecting climate. Then, we will examine how CO\n2and other trace \ngases appear to be enhancing  the Earth’s greenhouse effect, producing global warming.\nAerosols Injected into the Lower Atmosphere:\n In the  previous section, we learned that tiny solid and liquid particles (aerosols) can enter the atmosphere from both human-induced and natural sources.The human-induced sources include emissions from factories, autos, trucks, aircraft, power plants, home furnaces and fireplaces, to name a few. \nMany aerosols are not injected directly into the atmosphere, but form when gases convert \nto particles. Some particles, such as sulfates and nitrates, mainly reflect incoming sunlight, whereas others, such as soot, readily absorb sunlight. Many of the particles that reduce the amount of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface tend to cause a net cooling of the surface air during the day.Land use changes:All climate models predict that, as fossil fuels continue to spew greenhouse gases into the air, the climate will change and the Earth’s surface will warm. But are humans changing the climate by other activities as well?"

For example, studies show that about half the rainfall in the Amazon River Basin is returned to the atmosphere through evaporation and through transpiration from the leaves of trees. Consequently, clearing large areas of tropical rain forests in South America to create open areas for farms and cattle ranges, as is happening now, will most likely cause a decrease in evaporative cooling. This decrease, in turn, could lead to a warming in that area at least several degrees Celsius. In turn, the reflectivity of the deforested area will change. Similar changes in albedo result from the overgrazing and excessive culti -\nvation of grasslands in semi-arid regions, causing an increase in desert conditions (a process known as desertification).\nIncreasing Greenhouse Gases Emission \nCarbon dioxide is one of a greenhouse gas that strongly absorbs infrared radiation and plays a major role in the warming of the lower atmosphere. Everything else being equal, the more CO\n2\nin the atmosphere, the warmer the surface air is. We also know that CO2 has been increasing \nsteadily in the atmosphere, primarily due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Deforestation is also adding to this increase. Through the process of photosynthesis, the leaves of trees remove CO\n2 from the atmosphere. The CO2 is \nthen stored in leaves, branches, and roots. When the trees are cut and burned, or left to decay, the CO\n2 goes back into the atmosphere.\nMoreover, Nitrous Oxide (N2O) and Methane (CH4) are greenhouse gases that causes for \nclimate change. These three gases are differ in how they absorb energy (preventing it from escaping to space) and how long the gas stays (life time)  in the atmosphere. For example, CO\n2 \nstays for over 100 years while, the others two gases last relatively for short time.

This warming trend is real, as the average global surface air temperature since the late 1800s has risen by about 1.\n0 C. \nMoreover, the global average for each decade since the 1980s has been warmer than that of the preceding decade. There are many signs of increasing global warmth other than temperature readings. For example, the amount of water locked in the world’s glaciers and ice sheets is steadily decreasing, and sea level is steadily rising.\nGlobal warming might even be apparent where you live. The growing season, for example, \nmay be getting longer, or you may find the changing of the leaf color in autumn tending to happen later than in the past.

Consequences of Climate Change\nAt the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u001f examine the impacts of climate change on human beings and other life forms; and\n\u001f assess the impacts of climate change on the physical features such as water and \nforest.\nKEY TERMS:  Sea level rise, sea ice melt, Food security\nIf the world continues to warm as predicted by climate models, where will most of the warming take place? \nClimate models predict that land areas will warm more rapidly than the global average, particularly \nin the northern high latitudes in winter. We can see that the greatest surface warming for the period 2001 to 2006 tended to occur over landmasses in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, as experienced in Canada and Russia. As high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere continue to warm, modification of the land may actually enhance the warming. For example, the dark green boreal forests of the high latitudes absorb upto three times as much solar energy as does the snow-covered tundra. Consequently, the winter temperatures in subarctic regions are, on the average, much higher than they would be without trees. If warming allows the boreal forests to expand into the tundra, the forests may accelerate the warming in that region. As the temperature rises, organic matter in the soil should decompose at a faster rate, adding more CO\n2 to the air, which might accelerate the warming even more. \nTrees that grow in a climate zone defined by temperature may become especially hard hit as rising temperatures place them in an inhospitable environment. These changes in temperature will also affect people in many ways, of course, including direct effects on human health. For example, with heat waves expected to become more frequent and intense, heat-related deaths are expected to increase, although there could be some compensating decrease in cold-related illnesses. In the lower latitude, there are more frequent droughts and unpredictable rainfall due to global warming. Predictions show that global warming will amplify current dangers and introduce new ones, seriously affecting people’s ability to support themselves.\nPrecipitation\nChanges in precipitation and drought may be just as important as changes in temperature over the coming decades. As with temperature, changes in precipitation will not be evenly distributed, as some areas will tend to get more precipitation and others less."

In many areas, there has also been an increase in the intensity of the heaviest precipitation events during the last 50 years or so.\n The changes in precipitation adversely affect by placing added stress on agriculture. Even \nin places where average annual precipitation does not change, it is possible that rainfall and snowfall will be focused in more intense wet spells, with longer dry periods in between. In many parts of the world, observations show that the heaviest one-day rainfall events are already becoming heavier. In addition, warming temperatures will tend to cause soil to dry out more quickly, exacerbating the impact of drought when it occurs. \nSea Level Rise\nAnother major consequence of climate change is an increase in sea level, as land-based ice sheets and glaciers retreat, the oceans continue to expand and get warm. During the twentieth century, average global sea level rose by about 17 cm. From 1900 to 2010, globally averaged sea level rose about 19 cm, with the pace accelerating from the 1990s onward. About half of that was a result of melting glaciers and ice sheets, with the other half produced by the expansion of oceans as they warm. Globally averaged sea level has risen about twice as quickly since 1993, roughly 3.4 cm per decade, as it did during the twentieth century as a whole.\nSea level rise will be a growing issue in the coming decades for the many millions of people \nwho live near coastlines around the world. Storm surges will occur atop a higher baseline water level. Rising ocean levels could also have a damaging influence on coastal ecosystems, such as coral reefs. In addition, coastal groundwater supplies might become contaminated with saltwater.\n   Figure 2.6 Rising Seas: As sea ice \nand ice caps at both of the Earth's \npoles continue to melt at unprec-edented rates, rising sea levels can put coastal and island communi -\nties like those in the Philippines at risk of flooding and water damage.\nFigure 2.6 Rising Seas:"

Hence, in Antarctica, more snow might actually fall in the warmer air. This situation could allow snow to build up across the interior, although it may be counterbalanced by an increase in melting already taking place along the Antarctic coastline. Over Greenland, which is experiencing rapid melting of ice and snow, any increase in precipitation will likely be offset by rapid melting, and so the ice sheet is expected to continue to shrink. Sea ice has been shrinking and thinning rapidly across the Arctic Ocean. During the summer of 2007 , and again in the summer of 2012, the extent of Arctic sea ice dropped dramatically to new record lows. If the warming in this region continues at its present rate, summer sea ice may, at times, shrink to cover less than 10 percent of the Arctic Ocean by the middle of this century, or even sooner.\nEffects on ecosystems\nIncreasing levels of CO2 in a warmer world could have many other consequences. For example, greater amounts of CO2 can be expected to act as a “fertilizer” for some plants, accelerating their growth, although this process can slow over time if water, nitrogen, and other nutrients were not plentiful enough to sustain the growth. In some ecosystems, certain  plant species could become so dominant that others are eliminated. In tropical areas, where many developing nations are located, the effects of climate change may actually decrease crop yield, whereas higher latitudes might benefit from a longer growing season and an earlier snowmelt. Extremely cold winters might become less numerous, with fewer bitter cold spells. \n      Figure 2.7 Sea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface, forming \nand melting with the polar seasons.

This term refers to changes in processes, practices and structures to moderate potential damages or to benefit from opportunities associated with climate change” .\nThe most commonly identified adaptation strategies in Ethiopia include soil conservation, \nterracing, water harvesting, crop diversification, changing crop planting date, planting trees and irrigation.\nFigure 2.9: Climate change Adaptation using irrigation and planting trees. \nTypes of AdaptationDepending on its timing, goal and motive of its implementation, adaptation can either be reactive or anticipatory, private or public, planned or autonomous. Adaptations can also be short/long term, localized or widespread (IPCC 2001). In unmanaged natural systems, adaptation is autonomous and reactive, and is the means by which species respond to changed conditions. In these situations, adaptation assessment is essentially equivalent to natural system impact assessment. \nReactive or Anticipatory Adaptation\nReactive adaptation is the one that takes place after the initial impacts of climate change have occurred. Anticipatory adaptation takes place before impacts become apparent. In natural systems, there is no anticipatory adaptation."

Following a proposal by Malta, the United Nations General Assembly addressed climate change for the first time by adopting Resolution 43/53. This recognized that “climate change is a common concern of mankind, since climate is an essential condition which sustains life on earth”, and determined that “necessary and timely action should be taken to deal with climate change within a global framework …” The WMO and UNEP established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to assess the magnitude and timing of changes, estimate their impacts and present strategies for how to respond. \nThe IPCC published the First Assessment Report on the state of the global climate (1990) , \nwhich had a potent effect on policy makers and on public opinion. It became the main basis \nfor negotiations under the United Nations General Assembly on a climate change convention, beginning in late 1990. The Second World Climate Conference met in Geneva in November, and, unlike the 1979 Climate Conference, included ministers as well as scientists. On 21 December the United Nations General Assembly established, by Resolution 45/212, the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC) as “a single intergovernmental negotiating process under the auspices of the General Assembly.” The INC met for five sessions between February 199 1 and May 1992.\nThe IPCC finalized its Second Assessment Report in time for COP 2 in Geneva in June 1996 \nIt concluded that on the balance of available evidence, there was indeed a discernible human influence on global climate that posed hazards to human and economic development. It recommended cost-effective steps, consistent with sustainable development and designed to provide “no regrets” safeguards against such risks. \nCOP 6 (2001) resumed in Bonn in late July and reached an outline agreement – the so-called \nBonn Agreements – on an emissions trading system, on a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), on rules for accounting for emissions reductions from carbon “sinks” and on a compliance regime. It also outlined a package of financial and technological support to help developing countries contribute to global action on climate change and address its adverse effects. Detailed legal texts based on these decisions were on the negotiating table at COP 7 , held in Marrakesh in late 2001. COP 7 adopted the respective decisions, the so-called Marrakesh Accords."

COP 10 (2004) , held in Buenos Aires in December, the predominant issue was adapting to climate change and one of the outcomes was the Buenos Aires programme of work on adaptation and response measures. \nThe Kyoto Protocol (2005) came into force on 16 February. The first Conference of the Parties \nserving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 1) was held with COP 1 1 in Montreal in November and December. It was one of the most successful to date, with an important political break-through being the decision by Parties to start a dialogue on strategic long-term cooperative action. In 2006 of a total United Nations membership of 19 1 nations, 189 countries and the European Community have joined the Convention (and 164 countries and the European Community have joined the Kyoto Protocol). It is therefore clear that the Convention is one of the most universally supported international agreements in existence.\nThus, the international agreement called the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 and put \ninto force in February 2005. The Protocol set mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in countries that adopt the plan. Although the percent by which each country was to reduce its emissions varies, the overall goal was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries by at least 5 percent below existing 1990 levels during the five-year period of 2008 through 2012. For the industrialized nations that participated in the Kyoto Protocol, emissions expected to be dropped by more than 22 percent. \nHowever, the United States did not ratify the protocol, and many developing nations such as \nChina were not required to carry out emission reductions, since they had been responsible for only a small part of the accumulated CO\n2 up to that point. As a result, the global total of \ngreenhouse gas emissions actually increased by more than 25 percent from 1990 to 2012."

Improving crop and livestock production practices for higher farmer income and \nfood security while reducing emissions: \nThis pillar recognizes that agriculture will remain a core sector of the economy that provides \nemployment to the majority of the Ethiopian population. Traditional economic development could deliver the required growth required in this sector, but at a cost. The CRGE strategy, however, prioritizes initiatives that limit soil-based emissions from agriculture and limits pres -\nsure on forests by limiting expansion of land under cultivation. The strategy also prioritizes initiatives that increase the resource efficiency and productivity of the livestock sector. The prioritized initiatives in the livestock sector have offered the combined benefit of economic growth support, by increasing pastoralists’ income and limiting emissions.\nii. Protecting and re-establishing forests for their economic and ecosystem services \nincluding carbon stocks:This pillar recognizes that in order to support continued growth in economic and eco-system services as well as growth of the GDP, deforestation and forest degradation should be reversed. The CRGE initiative has prioritized strategies to reduce demand for fuel wood, and increase afforestation, reforestation, and forest management to increase carbon sequestration in forests and woodlands as well as the promotion of area closure, which would result in increased storage of carbon in Ethiopian forests.\niii. Expanding electricity generation from renewable sources of energy for domestic \nand regional markets: This pillar recognizes electricity as a fundamental enabler of modern economic development for powering cities, fuelling industrial activity and pumping irrigation water for agriculture. Ethiopia which needs to expand its electricity supply at a rate of 1 4% per annum is endowed in natural resources which can meet this demand. In particular, its plan is to exploit its vast potential for hydro, geothermal, solar and wind power – all of which would deliver electricity at virtually zero GHG emissions. It is worth highlighting here that the generation of clean energy also allows for green development of other sectors of the economy. There is also potential that the projected supply will surpass domestic demand, which offers a possibility of exporting its clean energy to neighboring countries."

Climate change may be attributed to external and internal causes. The external causes of climate change for instance include:Changes in incoming solar radiation; Changes in the composition of the atmosphere; Changes in the surface of the Earth. The Milankovitch theory proposes that alternating glacial and interglacial episodes during the past 2.5 million years are the result of small variations in the tilt of the Earth’s axis and in the geometry of the Earth’s orbit around the sun. Fluctuations in solar output (brightness) may account for periods of climatic change. Volcanic eruptions, rich in sulfur, may be responsible for cooler periods in the geologic past.The earth’s climate has undergone considerable change during the geologic past.possible causes of climate change, is extremely complex, as a change in one variable in the climate system almost immediately change other variables. Climate change can be brought on by both natural events and by human (anthropogenic) activities.Climate change may also be brought naturally by volcanic eruptions rich in sulfur and by variations in the sun’s energy output.Human activities, such as emitting vast quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, can produce climate changes worldwide. Global average temperatures since the late nineteenth century have risen by about 1\n0C.\nMany studies have found that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases are the primary cause of this warming.Sophisticated climate models project that, as levels of CO\n2 and other greenhouse gases con -\ntinue to increase, the Earth’s surface will warm substantially by the end of this century.The models also predict that, as the Earth warms, there will be a global increase in atmospheric water vapor, more extreme precipitation events, a worsening of drought impacts, a more rapid melting of sea ice, and a rise in sea level."

The fourth conference known as the “World Summit on Sustainable Development” was held in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2002. This summit placed much more emphasis on the social and economic aspects of sustainable development.\nWhile many and confusing definitions of sustainable development abound, others state that “a \ndevelopment path is sustainable if total welfare does not decline along the path”. Critical to this definition is a realization that sufficient welfare functions through consumption, environmental quality, social equity, and other factors to the quality of life. This definition is broad enough to capture the essence of a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving the natural resources. This is necessary so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for generations to come, intergenerational equity so to speak. \nSustainable development as a concept puts the relationship between economic growth and \nthe environment at its core. The term was first used in 1987 by the World Commission on Environment and Development. It is also known as the Brundtland Commission, names after its chair, Gro Harlem Brundtland. In the commission’s report, “Our Common Future,” sustainable development has been defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”.\nIt is clear that this definition is rooted in a systems thinking as it stresses the three interdependent \nand mutually reinforcing pillars of sustainable development: economic development, social development, and environmental sustainability. \nFigure. 3.1: Nested Pillars of Sustainable Development"

The nested rings approach insists that the economy is dependent on society and the environment. Human and economic activities take place within the environment and the society, depend on and have an impact on the environment. A key issue for sustainable development is, therefore, the integration of different dimensions of sustainability, taking a holistic view and overcoming barriers between disciplines, ideologies and sectors.\nThe three essential dimensions of sustainable development are:\nI. Economic: an economically sustainable system must be able to produce goods \nand services on a continuing basis, to maintain manageable levels of government and external debt, and avoid extreme sectoral imbalances that damage agricultural and/or industrial production.\nII. Environmental: an environmentally sustainable system must maintain a stable resource base and avoid overexploitation of non-renewable resource systems, including maintenance of biodiversity, atmospheric stability and ecosystems services not always looked upon as economic resources.\nIII. Social: a socially sustainable system must achieve fairness in distribution and opportunity among all persons with adequate provision of such social services as health, education and gender equity. The social dimension focuses on reconciliation of environment and development, and governance related to provision of social services.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity\n6 The 17 SDGs are integrated, they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.\n6 Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who are furthest behind.\n6 The SDGs are designed to end poverty, hunger, HIV/AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.\n6 The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all society are necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context."

The SDG’s integration into theGrowth and Transportation Plan II (GTP II) was, therefore, made possible by taking into account principal directions from GTP II. \nGTP II focuses on creating conducive condition for macroeconomic stability, ensuring fast \nand sustained economic development, infrastructural development, human resources and technological capacity building, ensuring good governance and democratic systems building, environmental development, building of democratic systems, and in general fulfilling the renaissance journey of Ethiopia. Existing institutional forms and mechanisms have been used in implementing the SDGs and GTP II. SDGs have also a role to accelerate the economic development of Ethiopia in infrastructures development.\nIntegrated with GTP II, SDGs were implemented across the nation in 2015/16 fiscal year and \nprogresses have been registered. This was made possible through:1. Ensuring universal (inclusive) access to equitable and quality education (SDG 4).2. Ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all (SDG-6).3. Ensuring access to affordable & reliable energy for all (SDG-7) \nGood Health and Well-Being was one of the areas that progress has been registered. great \nprogress has been made against several leading causes of death and disease. Life expectancy has increased dramatically; infant and maternal mortality rates have declined and the tide on HIV and malaria deaths have halved."

This group of resources are also referred to as fixed or fund resources from the human point of view, because they are formed slowly and their supply is limited by nature. Therefore, with use, they are diminished or even last though time, and once they are used up, they are gone forever. This category consists of most mineral resources, such as coal, petroleum, Natural gas, Ferrous and Nonferrous metals, etc. \nCategories of resource conflicts \nResource conflicts are typically categorized according to the primary resource involved and to the main conflict driver. Typical resource categories include extractive resources (e.g., hydrocarbons, minerals, gemstones, and timber), land, and water. Of course, many conflicts involve the interplay of more than one type of resource. Indeed, in the majority of cases, one or more of the following drivers are at play: (1) conflict over resource ownership; (2) conflict over resource access; (3) conflict over decision making associated with resource management; and (4) conflict over distribution of resource revenues as well as other benefits and burdens.\nUnique characteristics of natural resource conflicts\nA number of characteristics associated with natural resource conflicts contribute to their complexity and, in turn, influence approaches to their resolution. The scarcity or abundance of a specific natural resource fundamentally influences the conflict dynamics at play and the mediation opportunities available.  Many resources are influenced by a range of natural and social factors leading to a high level of complexity and uncertainty in their availability, quality, and value. \nResource disputes often involve uneven geographic patterns of resource distribution that can \nbe particularly salient when they occur along ethnic, religious, or linguistic lines. Tensions between competing livelihood groups over scarce natural resources often occur in seasonal cycles, which can escalate into violent outcomes following sudden shocks or stresses to the system. \nNatural resources can play a number of different roles in the generation and escalation of \ntensions between stakeholders, ranging from triggering and intensifying conflicts to prolonging them. Resource conflicts can involve a wide range of actors and stakeholders, including nation-states, local governments, ethnic groups, communities, civil society organizations, and private companies."

Resource disputes are sometimes associated with significant power imbalances and asymmetries between the parties (e.g., international corporations versus local communities, or lack of formal representation of a specific livelihood group in a decision making process). In many situations, natural resources are governed by a combination of customary and statutory institutions, or hybrid political orders.\nFigure 3.2: Drivers of resource based conflict \nConflict over resources \nConflicts over renewable resources are essentially political issues concerning who should have access to and control over the resources?. Whose views should count in identifying and prioritizing issues and problems, and, desirable management goals and rates of use?These key political questions can become sources of tension and division, based on the competing interests of different individuals, groups or countries. Such conflicts can occur at the local, national and transboundary levels as well as involve multiple stakeholders including communities, private sector actors, civil society organizations, local authorities and national governments.\nHowever, conflicts are not in themselves a negative phenomenon. They can be an essential \ncomponent of change and development. Non-violent resolution of conflicts is possible when the parties have trust in their governing structures and institutions to manage incompatible or competing interests.Conflict becomes problematic when mechanisms for managing and resolving them break down, and give way to violence.

These drivers, working alone or \nin combination, have been important factors in contributing to violent conflict when acting alongside other socio-economic, political and security stresses. These are:        1. Competition over increasingly scarce renewable resources;         2. Poor governance of renewable natural resources and the environment; and,         3. Transboundary natural resource dynamics and pressures.These factors of conflicts over renewable natural resources can occur at many different levels (at the local, subnational, national and transboundary levels} and interact with larger political, economic or security stress factors and vulnerabilities. This is briefly discussed as follows:\n1. Competition over increasingly scarce renewable resources:\nThe concept of “resource scarcity” describes a situation where the supply of renewable resources such as water, forests, rangelands and croplands are not sufficient to meet the local demand. Increased scarcity of renewable natural resources that are needed to sustain livelihoods can increase competition between user groups or between economic sectors. Social responses to rising competition can include migration, technological innovation, cooperation and violent conflict. There are three main causes for increasing resource scarcity working separately or in combi -\nnation: These are: \n1.Demand-induced scarcity;\n2. Supply-induced scarcity; and3. Structurally induced scarcity.\nDemand-induced scarcity arises when demand for a specific renewable resource increases, \nand cannot be met by the existing supply. While a resource such as water or cropland may \ninitially meet all local needs, population growth, increases in consumption rates, and/or the use of new technologies can reduce the per capita availability of the resource over time. Supply-induced scarcity occurs when environmental degradation, natural variation or a breakdown in delivery infrastructure constrains or reduces the total supply of a specific resource. As the supply of natural resources is reduced, options for pursuing productive livelihood strategies are undermined, creating competition between livelihood groups that are difficult to resolve. \nStructural scarcity occurs when different groups in a society face unequal resource access. \nWhile structural scarcity can be caused by poor NRM, it can also exist even in a well-functioning governance structure, as the result of different land use decisions and tradeoffs. At the same time, it can also be caused by cultural practices as well as social and economic barriers. For example, in many regions of the world, women face restrictions in purchasing land, drilling water wells or harvesting resources."

            "text": "Management of Conflicts Over Resources\n73Similarly, poverty itself can act as a significant barrier to purchasing the equipment needed to \naccess and exploit a natural resource.2. Poor governance of renewable natural resources and the environment: Governance of renewable natural resources and the environment refers to the institutions, policies and processes that are established to regulate their management, ownership, allocation, use and protection.  In general terms, there are four types of grievances that lead to poor resource and environmental management.\nThe first is unclear, overlapping or poor enforcement of resource rights and laws.\nIn many countries, land and renewable natural resources are regulated under a combination of statutory, customary, informal and religious forms of tenure. Disagreements regarding these ‘rules’ as well as uncertainty over resource rights are often at the heart of conflict. The ‘rules’ of resource governance vary from country to country, and even within countries. In many countries in the global South, it is common to find renewable natural resources, including land, regulated under statutory, customary, informal and religious forms of tenure. In many cases, conflicts occur either because specific groups have no rights to the resources on which they depend for their livelihood, or no feasible way to exercise the rights they do have. Similarly, conflict can occur when institutional jurisdictions, mandates or resource management laws are unclear, overlapping or contradictory. A lack of state capacity to extend its presence and authority into rural areas in order to enforce laws and resolve disputes is often a key cause of poor NRM. \nThe second is discriminatory policies, rights and laws that marginalize specific \ngroups. When one group controls access to renewable resources to the detriment of others, \nnatural resource-dependent communities are often marginalized. Violence can occur as individuals and groups seek greater or more fair and equitable access to key resources. The struggle for increased equity can become linked to the recognition of identity, status and political rights, making conflict resolution even more difficult. As discussed above, this can be a key factor causing structural scarcity. \nThe third is unequal distribution of benefits and burdens from development projects. \nExtractive industries, industrial sites or major infrastructure projects can provide multiple benefits to local communities as well as seriously degrade, exhaust or pollute renewable natural resources and become a major source of grievance. The environmental impacts of development projects can create tensions if communities are not compensated for the damage, and do not receive a share of the development benefits, financial or otherwise."

Such grievances can become highly emotive because they impact upon a people’s way of life, or their perception of entitlement or lifestyle. \nThe fourth is lack of public participation and transparency in decision-making. \nNatural resource policies and interventions are often made by the state, in conjunction with private sector actors, without the active participation of affected communities or sufficient transparency and consultation with stakeholders.  Where communities and stakeholders are poorly engaged or excluded from the decision making process over renewable natural resources, they are likely to oppose any related decisions and outcomes. Lost access to key resources, eviction without compensation or sudden price increases for renewable resources such as water, can lead to significant tensions between the affected communities, the government and the private sector. \n3. Transboundary natural resource dynamics and pressures\nThe challenges of managing renewable natural resources often extend beyond national borders. This is particularly the case for water, wildlife, fisheries and air quality. Similarly, risks to renewable resources from waste management, pollution, climate change and disasters are often transboundary in nature. \nWhile states have - in accordance with the UN Charter and the principles of international law \n- the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, they also have the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other states. Furthermore, Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration refers to the issues of sharing in the use and management of resources that move across international borders. Yet, transboundary dynamics are often beyond the capacity of a single sovereign state to manage unilaterally, requiring cooperation and co-management with neighboring countries. There are four main types of transboundary dynamics and pressures that can cause conflicts over renewable natural resources. \nFirst, when the transboundary natural resources, such as water or fisheries are shared between \ncountries, conflicts can arise when one country consumes the resource at higher rates than another, and violates agreed allocations or demonstrates inflexibility when faced with natural variation."

In particular, pollution generated in one country can easily cross national borders, creating health risks in another. Similarly, changes in land use in one country, including high levels of deforestation and soil erosion, can heighten vulnerabilities to natural hazards in another. \nFigure 3.3: Dams on Trans-boundary Waters: GERD, Aswan and Sambangalou Top to down respectively."

Similarly, wildlife populations commonly migrate across national boundaries, shifting economic opportunities from one country to another. Both situations can be important sources of conflict as user groups face  increasing competition and lose their livelihoods. This in turn may result in the loss of indigenous communities and their cultural and spiritual heritage.\nFourthly one, of the emerging threats to the natural resource base of countries comes from \nillicit activities and criminal groups operating on a global and transboundary basis. Illicit extraction and trade of natural resources deprive  resource benefits of local communities which can lead to conflict. \nAt present, there are 263 rivers that either cross, or demarcate, international boundaries. To \ndate, shared water resources have more often been the stimulus for co-operation than for conflict. Various studies indicate that cooperative interactions between riparian states over the past fifty years have outnumbered conflictive interactions by more than two-to-one. Since 1948, the historical record documents only 37 incidents of acute conflicts (i.e., those involving violence) over water (30 of these events were between Israel and one or another of its neighbors, the last of which occurred in 1970), while during that same period, approximately 295 international water agreements were negotiated and signed.\n However, there are important qualifiers to this finding. They go on to observe that 158 of \nthe world’s 263 international basins lack any type of cooperative management framework, and that of the 106 basins with water institutions, approximately assisting in the design of co-management plans and institutions. Among these are:\n Iran and Iraq to resolve tensions over the development and conservation of the transboundary Mesopotamian marshlands;\n Iran and Afghanistan to address the degradation and co-management of the Sistan basin;\n Sudan and South Sudan to facilitate coordinated management \n Palestinian Authority and Israel to address water and waste management issues."

The upstream countries have argued for the unequal allocation of water resource shares and have been claiming for the right allocation. The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) was formally established in 1999 as an effort to coordinate the management of the basin between the ten river basin states, and to promote peace and security among its member states. The NBI is the first initiative to include the participation of all basin states. Upstream countries usually requesting:  \n To reach into agreement on equitable share;\n To undertake sustainable food production through irrigation and water supply;\n A mechanism for facilitating the construction of hydroelectric power; and\n A means of improvement of conservation of soil and water in collaboration with others. \nThus, at the heart of this dialogue is the question of equity. In 2010, five of the upstream states signed the “Nile River Basin Cooperative Framework” to utilize an equitable share of water from the basin, though Egypt and Sudan strongly opposed it. \nConflict Prevention StrategiesConflict prevention refers to the set of approaches, methods and mechanisms used to avoid, minimize, resolve and contain conflict in order to prevent a further escalation to violence. Where natural resources are a direct source of conflict, or a contributing factor in a larger conflict context, prevention strategies must take into account the complex inter-relationships between causes, potential impacts and possible interventions. The way that conflicts over natural resources become politicized within the broader conflict and political context is also essential to consider. In all cases, conflicts over renewable resources interact with existing political, socio-economic and security tensions and stress factors, requiring a response on multiple levels, including technical, political and institutional responses.International law commission (ILCs) article 5, states that water course states shall in their respective territories utilize an International water course in an equitable and reasonable manner. In particular, an international water course shall be used and developed among water course states with the view to attaining optimal utilization. An obligation not to cause significant harm to the river basin state(s) is written in article 7 of ILCs document. Article 8 states about obligation to cooperate; article 9 urges the exchange of data and information between the upstream and downstream states, and article 20 is about protection and preservation of the eco-system i.e., water course states individually and jointly protect and preserve the ecosystem of the international water course."

Appropriate interventions depend on the mix of conflict drivers, underlying vulnerabilities, livelihood responses, political processes, existing governance capacities and the level of conflict intensity. This could be achieved by implementing sustainable livelihoods and reduce vulnerability to resource scarcity. \nThe sustainable livelihoods framework\nThe sustainable livelihoods framework has been adopted by a number of UN agencies and donors to understand how to reduce poverty at the household level.

A major strength of the approach is that it does not perceive people as vulnerable and helpless, but as dynamic actors able to adapt to trends and cope with shocks.\nThe sustainable livelihoods approach does not offer a simple solution to the challenge of \ndeclining resource access and availability. However, it represents a useful approach to thinking through the problem, by providing a framework that facilitates coherent and structured discussion of differing perspectives. It draws attention to the assets people have rather than what they do not have; the cross-sectorial nature of livelihood strategies; to the vulnerability context; and to the role of policies, processes and institutions.\nBy encouraging local people to think about a broad range of livelihood outcomes, potential \nconflicts can be explicitly discussed and prevented. There are five basic approaches that can be used to increase livelihood opportunities and reduce vulnerability to resource scarcity:\n1. Livelihood diversification aims for livelihoods to become increasingly: \na. multi-sectorial, including agricultural and nonagricultural work; \nb. multi-locational, including on-farm, at home, and off-farm (including in towns and cities), and \nc. multi-occupational, including self-employment and working for others. The basic approach with diversification is to make livelihoods less dependent on a single scarce resource in order to reduce vulnerability to reductions in supply.\n2. Improving the efficiency of resource dependent livelihoods and the amount of value added to raw goods: This involves two main measures: \nd. improving the level of production of resource-dependent livelihoods (e.g., through agricultural extension, inputs, technologies); and \ne. adding more value to existing resources and raw goods (e.g., processing and manufacturing) at each stage in the value-chain.\n3. Livelihood adaptation programmes aim to adapt livelihoods to declines in resource availability from climate change and disasters. In areas where livelihoods are likely to be affected by long-term climate change, adaptation support is essential to prevent livelihood failure."

What is natural resource governance and why is \nit important in conservation of natural resources? \n2. What are the qualities of a good governance?\nNatural resource governance refers to the norms, institutions and processes that determine how power and responsibilities over natural resources are exercised, how decisions are taken, and how citizens – women, men, indigenous peoples and local communities participate in and benefit from the management of natural resources. \nNatural resource governance is increasingly contentious in view of the over-exploitation of \nnatural resources, the environmental degradation that results from excessive farming and mining, and the destruction of livelihoods in localities where such exploitation takes place. Improving natural resource governance, including securing rights and sharing power and responsibilities, can benefit both people and biodiversity, e.g., through improved ecosystem health and human wellbeing.\nLand use debates, especially in the arena of conservation, wildlife protection and sustainable \ndevelopment, revolve strongly around natural resource governance because the prioritization, allocation and management of resources exert a direct impact on the environment and its inhabitants. Implicit in such debates is the call for exploitation of natural resources to be carried out in a manner/extent that, “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generation to meet their own needs”.Brainstorming Activity 3.3"

This is why a central feature of natural resource governance pertains to indigenous self-determination and tenure rights. Unfortunately, the national legal frameworks of many countries have yet to accord the indigenous people sufficient recognition of their customary lands and the stewardship of their environments. \nThis is despite the existence of international conventions that advocate indigenous self-\ndetermination and self-governance. For example, Article 10 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) states that indigenous peoples should not be forcibly removed from their lands; and where relocation takes place, it must be with the free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned, coupled with fair and just compensation (United Nations, 2007). Similarly, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) recognises that communities are inextricably linked to their territories, and that the preservation of traditional knowledge is crucial to conservation and biological diversity.\nIt can be observed that consultation and access to justice are important in the protection \nof the rights of indigenous groups and any community affected by exploitation of natural resources or competing land use. Where the right to consultation is denied, an effective natural resource governance framework should provide the proper administrative or legal avenues of redress to the communities concerned. In the context of environmental protection, Article 1 of the Aarhus Convention or the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters advances three pillars of public participation, namely:\nI. The right of access to information, II. Public participation in decision-making and III. Access to justice, as a means to empower communities in the protection of their own environments.\nIn sum, natural resource governance should embody principles that, among other things, promote environmental sustainability and recognize the tenure rights and cultural integrity of the communities concerned. To this end, the operational aspects of natural resource governance should foster bottom-up consensus oriented, decision making among multiple stakeholders, premised on trust, shared commitment and common understanding."

However, it is challenging to distil common principles of good natural resource governance where multiple stakeholders function at different levels, interacting with culturally diverse communities, against the background of dissimilar geographical landscapes. Factionalism and the consequent competition and clash in priorities are the problems of governance framework in any sector. \nRobust laws, institutions, policies and processes can help reduce the vulnerability of \npopulations to renewable resource scarcity, resolve disputes between competing interests and prevent conflicts over resource access, ownership, control and management. It is impossible to prescribe ideal forms of institutions, policies and processes that could effectively manage natural resources and systematically resolve disputes. Given that conflicts over renewable natural resources are highly context dependent, no two governance solutions are ever the same. There are four main governance challenges often lie at the root of conflicts over natural resources. These include: \nI. Unclear, overlapping or poor enforcement of resource rights and laws; II. Discriminatory policies, rights and laws that marginalize specific groups;III. Unequal distribution of benefits and burdens from development projects; and, IV. Lack of public participation and transparency in decision-making. \nAs a result, improving the basic governance of renewable natural resources to prevent conflict generally involves five types of interventions: First Principle, there must be legal and institutional changes to clarify resource rights, responsibilities, laws and institutional mandates. This includes clearly recognizing and respecting the rights of poor and marginalized people who are directly dependent on natural resources. Second Principle, at the national level, equitable resource access should be a priority of public policy and one of the outcomes of development programmes. This should include assessing the level of inequitable access to renewable resources and how it relates to socio-economic inequality, poverty and livelihood vulnerability. Based on this analysis, public policies and measures should be adopted to improve equitable resource access linked to sustainable livelihoods and poverty reduction. Third Principle, an important component of any legal framework should include a requirement for conducting environmental and social impact assessments for all major development projects, including infrastructure, industrial sites, and major extractive industries."

Community-based and collaborative management approaches are often used as a solution.

In a society where the majority of the populace is poor with widespread illiteracy culminating in lack of access to justice and the high cost and scarcity of lawyers, traditional conflict resolution stands out as the best method of conflict resolution.\nIn Ethiopia, many rural and village communities do not refer complaints to the police or \nprosecuting authorities, but instead deal with them using indigenous tribal processes. To this end, people practice various indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms.\nThese indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms are deeply rooted in culture and traditions \nof different ethnic groups. The practices are therefore associated with the cultural norms and values of the peoples and gain their legitimacy from the community values instead of the state. Besides, due to the multi-ethnic composition of the country, indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms of Ethiopia are different from ethnic group to ethnic group. As a result, they do not have uniform application all over the country. \nIn the ancient days and most especially under the Fetha Negast [law of the kings], conflicts \nbetween individuals or communities were encouraged to be settled amicably at local level. Elders-Shimagle - or people appointed on ad-hoc basis to settle disputes played an important role in resolving conflicts. Even today, these mechanisms are widely practiced among the various ethnic groups to settle various conflicts and many other problems. Figure 3.3 showed that elders in the community in Sidama, Ethiopia, and Northern Kenya are looking for a solution to a conflict over land, pasture, and water supplies."

Moreover, even after passing through the procedures and penalties in the criminal court, in some parts of Ethiopia people use the indigenous conflict resolution mechanism for reconciliation and to reduce the acts of revenge.The pastoral community including the pastoralists of Ethiopia has well developed conflict resolution mechanism that involves elders and clan leaders to solve disputes in the context of traditional law. The T’eer of Somali, Gadaa system of Oromo and Mada’a of Afar are some of the indigenous conflict resolution and management systems which are governed by an unwritten law that is transmitted from generation to generation orally. \nAlthough, there have been some minor differences in their practice and implementation, the \nSomali, Borana and Afar pastoralists do have their own indigenous institutions led by Ogaz, Abbaa Gadaa and Kedo Abba, respectively. These pastoral communities have two types of law, the conflict resolution laws that concern intra-ethnic group disputes, and laws concerning interethnic group disputes. \nIn Afar, the conflicts between different clans are managed by the Mada’a based on their \ncustomary law and elders. Elders, of the Madd’a, not representing members in disputes are selected from different clans. The decisions by the council of elders are effective due to the tradition of forgiveness, respect for elders, and the transfer of resources as compensation.

Gumma is a conflict resolution technique related to killing, particularly unintentional killing of an individual from other or within the same clan. It helps to avoid grievances and revenge that often follow such a killing. \nIn the case of the Somalis, there is a well-developed, relatively well-structured conflict \nmanagement mechanism, where the guurti elders act as judges and jury, and their decisions are largely adhered to and respected by the community. The customary law of the Somali is exercised by the well-experienced elders, and the governing unit is the guurti (the council of elders). The institutions that elders developed are generally respected because elders are seen as trustworthy and knowledgeable people in the community, and are believed to make rational decisions. In addition to solving the conflicts, the elders take measure to prevent conflict through monitoring and punishing individuals who plan to trigger it and through pushing clans to respect the inter clan agreement in place.\nEven though different studies underline the importance of indigenous conflict resolution \nmechanism in achieving sustainable peace and its preference in pastoral areas of the country, indigenous institutions are regarded as an alternative to the formal legal system. The formal legal systems have several weak points such as inaccessibility of the formal court system in the pastoral areas and the lengthy process to achieve justice. There are also instances where the formal legal system returns the cases to be seen by the elders’ council, showing that indigenous conflict management and resolution mechanism bridges the gap created by the formal system. Formal conflict resolutions base themselves on a fixed code of law, and are hence unlikely to consider long standing social and economic relations among community members. Besides, government legal set ups often culminate in a zero sum outcome (winner-takes-all) because the main purpose is to serve justice through imposed agreements. They never target reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. \nIndigenous conflict resolution and management, on the contrary lead to win-win situations \nas it takes into account the interest of every party. The disputants acknowledge that they have something to gain and something to lose in the end. Especially, in inter-clan conflict cases, the government legal institutions are regarded as auxiliaries to the local mediation involving elders. Therefore, it is crucial to understand Ethiopian society’s potential and actual conflicts in their social context so that the norms, values and beliefs, fears and suspicions, interests and needs, attitudes and actions, relationships and networks are properly taken into account."

Land, one \nof the natural resources in particular, is essential to the livelihoods of millions of people. On the basis of the regeneration capacity, the Natural resources are classified into two broad categories.\ni. Renewable resources\nii. Non-renewable resourcesRenewable resources are resources that can replenish themselves in the foreseeable future. They are also known as flow resources. The renewable resources are replaceable in character, because they regenerate themselves through reproduction or recycling. Non-Renewable Resources are resources that do not replace or regenerate by natural processes. They are also referred to as fixed or fund resources, because they are formed slowly and their supply is limited by nature.\nThe term “Sustainable Development” was first used in 1987 by the World Commission on \nEnvironment and Development.  It is also known as the Brundtland Commission.  In the commission’s report, sustainable development has been defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”.  The Sustainable Development Goals, also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.\nWhen poorly managed, distributed or controlled in an unfair or unequal manner, natural \nresources can also be a major driver of conflict or instability. There are three main drivers of conflict over natural resources. These drivers, working alone or in combination, have been important factors in contributing to violent conflict when acting alongside other socio-economic, political and security stresses. These are:        1. Competition over increasingly scarce renewable resources;        2. Poor governance of renewable natural resources and the environment; and,        3. Transboundary natural resource dynamics and pressures.Conflict prevention refers to the set of approaches, methods and mechanisms used to avoid, minimize, resolve and contain conflict in order to prevent a further escalation to violence.

What is the contribution of Malthus in population growth?\n2. What is the major role of Neo-Malthusian in con -\ntemporary population growth debate?\nConservative vs. Radical TheoriesPopulation size and change play such a fundamental role in human societies that they have been the subject of theorizing for millennia. Most religious traditions have had something to say on these matters, as did many of the leading figures of the ancient world.\nConservative Theories1. Malthusian Theory\nThomas Malthus (177 6-1834)- Clergyman, Demographer and Economist maintained the idea that there is a natural law of population growth in which food production increases only linearly (1, 2, 3, 4, 5…etc.) and population rises geometrically  (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, …etc.).  Therefore population growth tends to outstrip food supply resulting in poverty and hunger – (a situation often described as the Malthusis crisis). In his 'Essay on the Principle of Population, Malthus (1798) wrote “the cause to which I allude is the constant tendency in all animated life to increase beyond the nourishment prepared for it\".\nMalthus suggested that a number of 'checks' would serve to keep the population at a level \nof subsistence (i.e., food supply ceiling). These, are the 'preventive checks' and the 'positive checks'. Preventive Checks: The key preventive check suggested by Malthus was one of 'moral restraint'. Men should attempt to marry late in life as this would give rise to fewer or smaller families. Positive Checks: The positive check, according to Malthus, includes every cause which in any degree contributes to shorten the natural duration of human life. These are diverse and range from poor living and working conditions that might lower resistance to disease, as well as disease itself, wars and famines."

Neo-Malthusianism\nOne of the most commonly held views in contemporary thinking on population is Neo- Malthusianism as derived from the arguments of Malthus.The Neo-Malthusians’ view follows the thinking of Malthus in that population growth is considered the main cause of poverty. However, unlike Malthus, they see birth control as a means of checking this growth. Not only do Neo-Malthusians believe that a reduction in population will reduce social problems and alleviate human suffering, but they also see such steps leading to economic growth and improvements in living conditions. An essential feature of the Neo-Malthusian argument, therefore, is the belief that the size of the population is the main cause of limitations to development, particularly in the less developed countries and that high population growth leads to high natural resource depletion and causes environmental degradation.This demographic deterministic view of poverty, underlie most debate and discussions on population since the 1960s. It is the ‘people versus resources’ viewpoint held by many academics, demographers and commentators who all believe that there are too many people for the available resources. \nNeo-Malthusians see the rapid rates of population growth in the developing countries resulting \nin widespread poverty, economic stagnation, environmental destruction, rapid urbanization, unemployment and political instability. \nLike Malthus, the Neo-Malthusians see the problem resting with the poor who produce more \nchildren, because of their ignorance and lack of foresight. The solution, therefore, lies in persuading (or forcing if needs be) the poor to have fewer children."

First, Neo-Malthusian arguments divert attention from the social and economic causes of poverty. Like Malthus, they simply blame human reproduction. The structure of underdevelopment is ignored, with the reproductive customs of developing countries people considered the main cause of their poverty. \nSecond, some critics argue that for those who saw the lower classes as a burden to society; \nMalthus and Neo-Malthusian view provides a perfect excuse not to improve their living conditions. They maintain that it is the failure of successive development strategies to bring about any appreciable improvement in the living conditions of the majority of the people of the world that needs to be discussed and not the productive habits of the poor.\nThird, contrary to Malthusian and Neo-Malthusian predictions, world food production has \nincreased more rapidly than that of population. The fact that many countries have stores suggest that it is the distribution of food resources, rather than a lack of, that is the key issue.\nFourth, many developing nations are now challenging the Malthusian and Neo-Malthusian \nperspectives on population and reclaiming their right to identify for themselves what they perceived their particular population problems are and how to resolve them without pressure from external agencies. \nFifth, there is a growing realization amongst development experts that population growth is \nNOT the cause of the development problems of the developing countries, but rather a symptom of the problems. New understanding and explanation of fertility rates in economically poor communities suggests that poor people may have many children for logical reasons, such as their economic value, and not just because they are backward-looking."

They both, implicitly, evaluate the reproductive behavior of people in the developing countries by criteria specific to western Europeans. When the rich nations suffer economic difficulties such as rising unemployment, these are treated as purely economic issues. However, when a developing country experiences obstacles to economic growth, then population pressure is often cited as the cause.\nConclusion on Malthusian and Neo-Malthusian\nThe Malthusian and Neo-Malthusian view has dominated academic discussion and debate on population since the early 1800s. Their perspective on population and resources has had a profound effect on the way population policy is formulated, especially in the developing world. It has helped in the formulation and implementation of family planning programmes, and helped highlight concern over development problems. \nHowever, the Neo-Malthusian approach which essentially argues for direct population control \nmeasures alongside development policies is filled with many difficulties. Not only does it divert academic attention away from arguably the most fundamental causes of poverty in the Third World, it also ignores the unequal distribution of global resources. At best, it fails to address the excessive pattern of resource consumption and waste by the 20% of the world's population who consume 80% of the earth's resources and instead blame the poor for being poor and for having large families. \nRadical Theories Ester Boserup’s Hypothesis\nEster Boserup - a Danish Economists offered an entirely different view on population resource debate. In her book ‘The Conditions of Agricultural Growth’ published in 1965, Boserup took an empirical approach to the relationship between population growth and food production rather than Malthus’s deductive approach (i.e., reasoned by calculations). \nUnlike Malthus, she believes that population growth is a major factor determining agricultural \ndevelopments. According to her, ‘population growth stimulates innovation and development in agriculture’ thus causing an increase in food production. This is summed up by the following phrase ‘...Necessity is the mother of invention’. This suggests that an increase in population provides a major incentive for ways to be found to increase food production."

Population change is \none of the determinants of technological change, and technological change is a determinant of demographic change.\n The increase in population pressure stimulates changes in the agricultural system. Rising population leads to intensification of farming methods in order to produce the extra food for the extra   numbers.\n The pressure to change agricultural production by modifying farming techniques and frequencies with which a plot of land is cultivated come from demand for increased food production\n The sustained growth of population and agricultural output has secondary effects, which will set off a genuine process of economic growth\n  All parts of the world have experienced these changes owing to the increase in population density\nThe conclusion from Boserup's hypothesis is that population growth naturally leads to development rather than being a hindrance to it. Boserup's idea is based upon field studies in SE Asia, and she developed her idea under a number of assumptions\nCritics of Ester Boserup's Hypothesis\nBoserup's idea has been criticised for having a rather weak economic basis and her idea applies only to the agricultural production of mainly the developing world where the number of people depends on agriculture. As an area becomes more industraialised and developed, conditions of inadequate food production are much more likely to result in out-migration rather than agricultural innovation.\nHer theory, according to some critics, fails to discuss the most recent technological innovations \nin the highly industrailised societies. Also critics have argue, her idea lacks any universal appeal because it is based on the assumption of an unsophisticated economies and ‘closed’ communities. In reality, communities are not closed instead; there is constant in- and out-migration. Relatively few communities, if any, operate closed systems producing food only to meet their own requirements. So, it is generally difficult to test her ideas.\nBoserup’s hypothesis gives no consideration to the qualitative aspects of diet and nutrition. \nThrough the changes in agricultural techniques suggested by Boserup, it is possible that output may increase but the overall quality of diet and nutrition may decline."

The innovation in agriculture cannot be presumed to occur immediately. If the population growth is rapid, it may overwhelm the agricultural system in the process of adjustment such that the necessary adjustments do not have time to occur. \nIt is clear that certain types of fragile environment cannot support excessive numbers of people. \nIn such cases, population pressure may not lead to technological innovation as Boserup suggested.\nBoserup herself admits that over-population can lead to unsuitable farming practices which \nmay degrade the land. And she also recognises that in certain physical environments, continu -\ning intensification of production may not be possible with rising population pressures.\nIn spite of Boserup's hypothesis, two major food problems persist in the world today - massive \nsurpluses in the developed world and famine, starvation and shortage in the developing world.It appears, therefore, that it is not the level of resources which is the main cause of concern but the inability to share and distribute available resources equitably amongst the world's population.\nJulian Simon - The 'Ultimate Resource' Theory\nJulian Simon (1932-1997), a US economist and statistician, made a significant contribution to the population versus resources debate. Unlike Malthus and Neo-Malthusians, Simon presents a radical optimistic theory to the whole debate. \nSimon believes that population growth is not necessarily a bad thing, suggesting the ultimate \nresource is the people. He believes people are able to innovate to sustain themselves.According to Simon, “the most important benefit of population size and growth is the increase it brings to the stock of useful knowledge. Minds matter economically as much as, or more than hands or mouths”.Simon believes that despite claims by neo-Malthusians that natural resources are finite with population growth, natural resources are not finite in any economic sense, which is why their cost can continue to fall.\nIn spite of the ‘doom and gloom’ of the Malthusian theory, Simon suggested the world food \nproduction has increased in both developed and developing countries since the World War II. According to him, the overall trend from 1948-1979 shows there has been an increase in food production per person."

According to Simon, any country that gives farmers a free market in food and labor secure property rights in the land and a political system that ensures these freedoms in the future will soon flush with food with an ever diminishing proportion of its workforce required to produce food.\nSimon blames the West for destroying the developing countries farmers despite the assistance \nthey give the developing countries in terms of technical shipments of food, by giving subsi -\ndies to their own farmers which raise food production artificially and hence reduce the world prices. \nSimon believes that subsidies to Western farmers go hand in hand with the policies of African \ngovernments which steal from their farmers by forcing them to accept below market prices. \nThe Marxian Perspective\nKarl Marx (1818-1883) maintained that poverty and resource depletion is not a consequence of population growth but of unequal distribution of resources between classes. Where ownership of and control over resources is confined to a capitalist or land owning class, potential always exists for poverty and hunger. Peasants and working poor have very little bargaining power compared to landlords and capitalists hence poverty and hunger results.According to Marx, capitalism creates surplus population through: physical separation of producers (peasants, artisans, workers) by landowners from their means of production (land, machinery, tools etc.)He also suggests that the destruction of traditional methods of farming and production through mechanization and changes in land usage and tenure are ways the capitalist rich class makes the working class poor.The result is the total reliance on wage labor by the poor to acquire means of consumption (food, clothing, shelter, etc.).  According to Marx, poverty occurs, not because of overpopulation, but rather through lack of access to means of gaining subsistence.\nReflective Activity 4.1\nReflective Activity 4.1\n     \n1.

What is a population policy? Why is popula -\ntion policy formulated in a country? \n2. What are the major categories of population \npolicies?\nA population policy is a policy that is formulated and implemented by a government in or -\nder to plan and control population growth, spatial distribution and structure based on the economic, social, cultural, political, and demographic conditions of the country. It is needed mainly to address population- related problems in a country.\nThe population policies of countries can be broadly categorized into two groups as: anti-na-\ntalist and pro-natalist policies. Both reflect the fact that while individual women and families ultimately control fertility, the state can play a pivotal role in providing or prohibiting access to reproductive health, family planning and other resources associated with fertility behavior.  These influences of the state and their policies can directly target fertility or more indirectly shape the broader relational contexts of fertility geographies.\nPro-natalist policies\nWhat are the major characteristics of a pro- natalist policy? Which countries implement a pro-natalist policy? Pro-natalist population policy seeks to increase fertility rates, in particular, and population growth rates, in general. Pro-natalists seek to incentivize increased fertility. They have a long historical pedigree and have been adopted by numerous countries, notwithstanding the civil liberties issues they can raise. While no single policy appears most effective, such policies do appear to influence fertility rates. Brainstorming Activity 4.2"

In general, besides explicit exhortation and propaganda, pro-natalism is usually expressed in policies embracing welfare issues. It comes through, for example, in schemes that facilitate women leaving the paid labor force, grant mothers significant maternity pay, or provide substantial support for child caring mothers. For example, the French government worked to increase birth rates through such measures as the 1939 Family Code, provision of social and family benefits such as birth premiums, loans to young married couples, and housing subsidies. Many policies and the socio-cultural environments they support work more indirectly in promoting fertility than explicit pro-natalist policies. For example, acknowledging factors linked to fertility, governments may seek to ensure greater equality within the workplace and a reduction of the burden of family-work responsibilities by creating more flexible working hours, child care assistance, tax incentives, family allowances or low cost housing loans. Such policies can make having a child more economically feasible; highly relevant when noting the high average “cost” of raising a child. In support of this, an Austrian study found increases in parental leave increased fertility. Pro-natalist policies may also be motivated by concerns about dependency consequences of an ageing society of low fertility. As noted, earlier governments may respond through facilitating immigration. Since much of the world’s population is still young, working-age immigrants from the Global South, in particular, can potentially provide both needed workers for countries with declining populations as well as increased fertility rates on account of their demographic concentration within the child-bearing years. Such policies, however, are likely to be extremely politically sensitive.\nAnti-natalist policies\nWhat are the major characteristics of an anti-natalist policy? Which countries implement an anti-natalist policy? Anti-natalist population policy seeks to lower fertility rates, in particular, and population growth rates, in general. countries may enact anti-natalist policies designed to reduce fertility.  In fact, some countries have alternated between pro- and anti-natalist policies. The most well-known anti-natalist attempt to reduce fertility has been China’s “one child” policy. When the country breakdown the campaign to promote birth control in the 1950s saw China’s TFR shoot up to over 6.0 by the early 1960s."

In 1994, there was an International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo which aimed at “linking population more effectively to core development agendas”. \nGlobal population is increasing by about 1.5 percent per year, a growth rate (should it persist) \nthat in less than half a century will double the number of people who live on the planet. On the other hand, modern medical techniques are producing life extension but not healthy life extension, and we are seeing numbers of old and chronically sick or disabled elderly people in increasingly longer economically unproductive retirements, who need consequentially increasing numbers of younger people to support them. \nThe ability of the Earth to sustain the human population, posed by Malthus over 200 years \nago, is a serious question. Dependence on finite resources for energy and water is already threatening international stability. Potentially exponential population growth can only make matters worse. Improving economic development in the most populous countries of the developing world is leading to changing patterns of demand, as people seek more affluent lifestyles. Food and energy demands are increasing faster than had been predicted. Air quality resulting from over-rapid industrialisation is becoming a major problem that will have major public health effects. The likely determinants of climate change, usually attributed to the developed nations, are now spread throughout the developing world, making the ability of nations to achieve the targets signed-up to at Kyoto unlikely to be achieved. \nInternational Moves\nIn 1994 the United Nations Population Information Network (POPIN) organised an Inter -\nnational Conference of Parliamentarians on Population and Development (ICPPD) and an International Conference of Parliamentarians on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo. There was a shift in thinking recognised at Cairo, towards viewing population from a more humane and equitable perspective. The consensus document that was produced recognises that consumption in wealthy countries and rapid population growth in poor countries put pressure on the natural environment, both locally and globally.\nRather than simply equating population policy with family planning, the new thinking is that \npopulation growth should be stabilised - and development enhanced - by attacking some of the roots of the problem: by improving women’s access to education, health care, and economic and political decisions."

Family planning is central to genderequality and women’s empowerment, and it is a key factor in reducing poverty.

At family planning offices, women receive free contraception and pre-natal classes. Help is provided for pregnant women to closely monitor their health. India has greatly increased food production per head over last 20 years, making it better placed to absorb higher numbers. The country’s most recent approach to population issues focuses on the advancement of women economically, academically, and socially, as independent women are more likely to have small families.Figure 4.1: Contraceptive Methods\nContraceptive patch\nBirth control pillsCondom male and femaleCervical cap and diaphrgamBirth control injectionsIntrauterine device\nSpermicides"

What fostered a breakdown \nin the continent's ability to feed itself has been a decline of nearly 1 percent per year in per capita grain production since 1968 - in part due to an annual population growth for the continent approaching 3 percent.The root cause of Africa's crisis is population growth faster than any other continent in history, widespread soil erosion and desertification, and a failure by African governments to adequately support agriculture.\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), committed to by all 19 1 United Nations \nmember states, are rooted in the concept of sustainable development.

The most common \nindicators used to measure countries development are discussed as follows:\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nThe GDP is a measure of the market value of commodities. It is the total value of currently produced final goods and services within a country’s borders, usually in a year, irrespective of who owns the outputs. In developing countries, the GDP is not only low, but it is also dominated by primary commodities. On the other hand, secondary and tertiary economic activities contribute to the biggest shares to the GDP in the developed countries. The GNP is the total value of goods and services produced by a country in a year, including incomes secured from abroad, through varied activities.Per-Capita Income How can the per-capita income of a country be measured? Per capita income or total income measures the average income earned per person in a given area in a specified year. It is calculated by dividing the country’s total income by its total population. Per capita income is national income divided by population size. of course as a measure of peoples’ quality of life, it is indicative of their standard of living.In the same way as the GDP, per-capita income for developed countries is very high and growing. This is the result of ever-increasing GDPs that are based on diversified urban industrial and commercial economies. Developing countries, on the other hand, have low per-capita incomes, whose bases are primary economy that lack diversification.\nStandard of Living \nStandard of living is the level of income, comforts and services available, generally applied to a society or location, rather than to an individual. Standard of living is relevant because it is considered to contribute to an individual’s quality of life. Standard of living is perhaps the best measure of the quality of life of a given society. It is directly related to both the GDP and per-capita income. This is because, as the latter get higher, the former improves, and vice versa. Developed countries have high and constantly growing living standards, while people of the developing world are characterized by low living standards. Based on the above and other indicators of development, countries of the world can be classified and named in different ways such as rich/poor, developed/ developing, north/south, first/second world, and more developed/less developed world. Also, using current development status as a criterion, they can be grouped as: developed, less developed and least developed."

Population growth can reduce or eliminate food production gains resulting from modernization of farming. Population pressures may also encourage practices, such as over irrigation and overuse of crop lands, which undermine the capacity to feed larger numbers. In some cases population growth is quite directly related to a social problem because it increases the absolute numbers whose needs must be met. For example some less developed countries have made enormous progress in increasing the percentage of children enrolled in school. However, because of population growth during the same period, the number of children who are not enrolled in school also increased because there were insufficient resources to meet the growing need."

This includes not only the study of the direct pathological effects of various chemical, physical, and biological agents, but also the effects on health of the broad physical and social environment, which includes housing, urban development, land-use and transportation, industry, and agriculture.” (Healthy People 2010). \nEnvironmental health can be defined as the interconnection between people and their envi -\nronment by which human health and non-polluted environment are sustained.Environmental health comprises those aspects of human health, including quality of life, that \nare determined by physical, biological, social, and psychosocial factors in the environment. It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing, correcting, controlling, and preventing those factors in the environment that can potentially affect adversely the health of present and future generations.\nEnvironmental Health: The Global Scene\nOne of the drivers of the integration of environmental health issues into the overarching no -\ntion of sustainable development has been the UN Agenda 21, agreed by governments at the 1992 UN Earth Summit. Chapter 6 of Agenda 21 specifically addresses health issues, with five key target areas all of which related directly to environmental health priorities. These target areas are:\n1. Meeting primary health care needs, particularly in rural areas;\n2. Controlling communicable diseases;3. Protecting vulnerable groups;4. Meeting the urban health challenge; and5. Reducing health risks from environmental pollution\nThe global MDGs and SDGs have given   due attention to environmental health in many of their goals and targets. Sustainable Development and SDGs reflect the common understanding that a healthy environment is integral to the full enjoyment of basic human rights, including the rights to life, health, food, water and sanitation, and quality of life."

The second model is, Public Health Model, where attempts are made to control disease-causing agents which might already have infested the environment and created public health problems.

Sustainable development analysis differs from the standard economics of growth and development by incorporating natural resources as a form of natural capital. This may refer to the value of the existing stock of natural resources such as forests, fisheries, water, mineral deposits, and the environment in general. Natural capital provides goods and services to people, just as do financial capital, manufactured capital, and human capital. Actually, the human capital can be developed by investments in education and health. \nISSUES IN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT III \nCHALLENGES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT"

Large proportions of the world populations \nare consuming too little, particularly less developed countries. In 2015, approximately 10% of the world’s population (736 million) lived in extreme poverty with incomes of less than $1.90 per day. In 2017 , 821 million people were malnourished, an increase in the number reported malnourished compared with 2016. In addition, rising inequality resulted in increasing polarization of society. Therefore, the weakness of the real world process is complicating the problem and challenging the sustainability of the resource utilization. The welfare of the citizen is also endanged. This unit therefore deals with the related socioeconomic issues such as multiple faces of poverty, globalization, the growing imbalance of regions and countries, corruption, and global health crises.   There is an urgent need for further economic development to lift people out of poverty.  \n5.1. Multiple faces of poverty and implication to development\nAt the end of this section, you will be able to:\n identify the causes of poverty and their link to economic development; and\n explain the relationship between conflict and poverty. \nKEY TERMS: Absolute poverty, Relative poverty, income security, opportunity, empowerment \nAttempt the following question individually and then share with your classmates.\n1. How do you express poverty in your local context? What are the main dimensions and indicators of poverty?\n5.1.1. Concepts of PovertyPoverty is generally considered to be a measure of deficiency of the basic needs that a person, household or community required to meet as a basic standard of living. This deficiency can be measured either in terms of a lack of resources such as income, assets, capabilities (e.g.  skills, knowledge, technology or both). Basically poverty could be divided into two much known division; absolute and relative poverty. Absolute poverty is when household income is below a certain level, which makes it impossible for the person or family to meet basic needs of life including food, shelter, safe drinking water, education, healthcare, etc."

            "text": "Challenges of Economic Developmnet\n125In this state of poverty, even if the country is growing economically it has no effect on \npeople living below the poverty line. Absolute poverty compares households based on a set of income level and this level varies from country to country depending on its overall economic conditions.Relative poverty is when households receive 50% less than average household incomes, so they do have some money but still not enough money to afford anything above the basic need. This type of poverty is, on the other hand, changeable depending on the economic growth of the country.\n6 Relative poverty is sometimes described as “relative deficiency” because the people falling under this category are not living in total poverty, but they are not enjoying the same standard of life as everyone else in the country. It can be expressed in terms of having internet, clean clothes, a safe home (a healthy environment, free from abuse or neglect), or even education.\n6 Relative poverty can also be permanent, meaning that certain families have absolutely no chance of enjoying the same standards of living as other people in the same society currently have access to. They are basically “trapped” in a low relative income box.\nWhen the relative approach is used to measure poverty, there is another concept that needs to be explored, namely, persistent poverty. This is when households receive 50 or 60% less income than average incomes every 2 out of 3 years. Since long-term poverty has more impactful consequences on economic and social conditions, persistent poverty is an important concept to bear in mind. There are also other measures of the dimensions of poverty and their indicators used in different researches works (Table 5.1). \nTable 5.1.

These are the structural reasons of poverty as well as the behavioral or cultural explanations for poverty.\nThe structural approach points to systemic reasons for poverty: such things as racial and \ngender discrimination embedded in our markets and institutions; the profit motive and consequent low wages making it difficult for some families to escape poverty; and the failure to invest sufficiently in education, health care, and social insurance. According to this view, all of these factors reduce opportunity and increase economic insecurity. The failure to correct and accommodate the natural differences between people results in an uneven playing field and promotes the creation of poverty. Structural approaches to poverty point to patriarchy, capitalism, white privilege, and racism as the fundamental causes of most of the poverty in Western economies. Thus, the structural approach has come to be associated with those on the political left.\nBehavioral or cultural approach: Without dismissing the fact that our structures, institutions, \nand systems might help explain poverty, especially the enabling of poverty, there are other researchers who emphasize culture, behavior, and personal differences as the source of much of the poverty that we observe in modern societies. Their argument is that there is a poverty culture or a set of attitudes and behaviors that tends to get passed along from parents to children and tends to perpetuate bad, self-defeating decisions, and hence poverty. Those attitudes (fatalism and the rejection of common societal norms like hard work, rationality, and non-violent dispute resolution) make many of the poor less attractive in the labor and marriage market and less capable parents. This perspective does not suggest that it is easy for low income people to resist these attitudes, but insists that each person has free will and is ultimately responsible for their own life. The behavioral or cultural approach to explaining poverty is typically favored by those who describe themselves as conservative or libertarian.Examining the features emphasized by poor people is one approach to examining the causes of poverty. Some of these features are:\n Lack of income and assets to attain basic necessities food, shelter, clothing, and acceptable levels of health and education.\n Sense of voicelessness and powerlessness in the institutions of state and society.\n Vulnerability to adverse shocks, linked to an inability to cope with them."

These assets are of several kinds:\n Human assets, such as the capacity for basic labor, skills, and good health.\n Natural assets, such as land.\n Physical assets, such as access to infrastructure.\n Financial assets, such as savings and access to credit.\n Social assets, such as networks of contacts and reciprocal obligations that can be called on in time of need, and political influence over resources.\nAs stated clearly in various literatures, poverty mainly caused by labor market issues, education, demographic characteristics (age and family structure), race, poverty-related policies and cultural factors.\n5.1.3. Relationship between Conflict and Poverty \nThere is increasing recognition among researchers, social activists as well as policy-makers that violent conflict and poverty are inter-linked. In some instances, poverty can be identified as a factor directly contributing to conflict and in other instances conflict could be seen as creating poverty. Poverty has traditionally been a concern of development. Violent conflict on the other hand has been considered a peace and security issue. It is only relatively recently that these idea have begun to converge around the issue of violent conflict and poverty. The literatures on conflict and chronic poverty to examine three hypotheses of relationship:        1. Conflict causes poverty        2. Poverty causes conflict        3. Resource wealth causes conflict\nConflict causes poverty\n There is some consensus around the proposition that conflict causes poverty. Recently however, partly due to the problems of getting reliable data, there have been mainly descriptive accounts of the costs of conflict. The direct impacts including battlefield deaths, disablement and displacement have long-term costs for societies. Chronic poverty is likely to increase due to higher dependency ratios caused by an increased proportion of the old, women and disabled in the population. In a global analysis of conflict affected countries found similar patterns of macro-economic effects including a fall in GDP per capita, food production and exports, a fall in gross investment, government revenue and expenditure. War can lead to entitlement collapse and famine. Drawing upon the literature on famine and conflict, one can distinguish a continuum from vulnerability to external shocks to starvation and death."

But it has outlined the political, economic and social dimensions of conflict which are likely to have an impact on chronic poverty. Moreover, the protracted, collapsed-state conflicts are likely to lead to intergenerational exclusion and chronic poverty. \nPoverty causes conflict \nThe hypothesis that poverty causes conflict is more contentious. Currently, conflicts are multi causal with a range of short term and long term factors coming into play, including a sudden economic slowdown in the face of rising expectations, external shocks and state crises. Isolating and weighting the different ‘risk factors’ is difficult. Is poverty a permissive or causal factor? Is it a structural cause, a trigger or an accelerator of violent conflict? Searching for root causes may have limited value given the capacity of conflicts to mutate over time. Few would argue for a deterministic link between poverty and conflict and the challenge is to understand how poverty may interact with a range of other factors in certain contexts and at certain times to produce violent conflict. A body of empirical work has emerged which examines poverty’s role as one of a number of causal factors behind violent conflict.\nResource wealth causes conflict \nRecent research works of the World Bank questions the view that conflicts are driven by grievance. The study also argues that popular perceptions are shaped by the discourse which conflicts themselves generate. War cannot be fought just on hopes and hatreds.  Civil wars occur when rebel organizations are financially viable. Therefore it is the feasibility of predation which determines the risk of conflict. Rebellion is motivated by greed, so that it occurs when rebels can do well out of war.\nReflective Activity 5.1\n     \n1. How can you express poverty that isn’t \nbased on a monetary indicator?

Basic concept of globalization Globalization has become one of the world's most contentious issues, the idea has been defined in a various ways, but the following is the most common one. Globalization is the process through which the world becomes more linked as a result of greater commerce and cultural interaction. Globalization has increased the production of goods and services. The biggest companies are no longer national firms but multinational corporations with subsid -\niaries in many countries. Globalization has been happening for hundreds of years, but it has accelerated dramatically in the last half century. Currently the term itself is used to describe the trend towards countries joining together economically, through politics, and education. Coun -\ntries joining together economically view themselves not just through their national identities, but as part of the world as a whole. \nFigure 5.1. The network of the global interaction"

Local businesses and brands in developing nations can go bankrupt as huge corporations in developed nations can dominate the economy of their country. Local traditions and cultures may change. People in poor counties may no longer wear their cultural costumes as they would want to look like the stars in Hollywood.  More and more schools in developing nations are teaching their students how to speak this global language etc. Globalization, thus, has many benefits and disadvantages and they are here to stay. Basically, the developed world has benefited from globalization, as they can sell more goods and products to on the global South. \n5.2.2. Globalization and Developing Countries \nGlobalization in the developing countries is manifested in the following  three important fields such as economic and trade processes, education and health systems and culture effects.\nEconomic and Trade Processes Field: Globalization helps developing countries to deal \nwith the rest of the world to increase their economic growth, solving the poverty problems in their country. In the past, developing countries were not able to tap on the world economy due to trade barriers. They cannot share the same economic growth that developed countries had. However, with globalization the World Bank and International Management encourage developing countries to go through market reforms and radical changes through large loans. Many developing nations began to take steps to open their markets by removing tariffs and free up their economies. The developed countries were able to invest in the developing nations, creating job opportunities for the people. For example, rapid growth in India and China has caused world poverty to decrease. However, countries in Africa still have the highest poverty rates, in fact, the rural areas of China which do not tap on global markets also suffer greatly from such high poverty. On the other hand, developed countries set up their companies and industries to the developing nations to take advantages of low wages and this causing pollution in countries with poor regulation of pollution. Furthermore, setting up companies and factories in the developing nations by developed countries affect badly to the economy of the developed countries and increase unemployment.\nEducation and Health Systems:  Globalization contributed to develop the health and \neducation systems in the developing countries. We can clearly see that education has \nincreased in recent years, because globalization has a catalyst to the jobs that require higher skills set. This demand allowed people to gain higher education. Health and education are basic objectives to improve any nations, and there are strong relationships between economic growth and health and education systems."

With more fortunes poor nations are able to supply good health care services and sanitation to their people. In addition, the government of developing countries can provide more money for health and education to the poor, which led to decrease the rates of illiteracy. This is seen in many developing countries whose illiteracy rate fell down recently. It is truth that, living standards and life expectancy of developing countries increase through economic gains from globalization. An important drawback of globalization is, globalized competition has forced many minds skilled workers where highly educated and qualified professionals, such as scientists, doctors, engineers and IT specialists, migrate to developed countries to benefit from the higher wages and greater lifestyle prospects for themselves and their children. This leads to decrease skills labor in the developing countries.\nCulture Effects: Globalization affected the developing countries culture in various ways. Not \nfew cultural traits have been enormously changed through globalization, as the people are simply imitating others cultures like America and European countries. On the other hand, many developing countries extreme dependence and emphasis to globalization might lead to destroying of their own culture, tradition, identity, customs and even their languages. It was witnessed in some Arab countries (Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan) their cultures have been affected negatively. A kind of clothes they wear and a sort behavior they show are totally changed. Furthermore, globalization leads to disappearance of many words and expressions from local languages because many people use English and French words. In addition, great changes have taken place in the family life, young people are trying to leave their families and live alone when they get 18 years old. As a result the extended family tends to become smaller than before. This kinds of changes are also observed in many urban areas of Ethiopia.

Advantages of Globalization \nGlobalization increases free trade: Globalization has increased the free trade between countries. \nThe increased capital liquidity has allowed investors in well developed nations to invest in developing countries.

Besides, global mass media has allowed vital \ninformation to be shared between corporations and individuals around the world.

Reduction of War: Reduction of war between well developed nations is probably one of the primary benefits of globalization. \nThe following is a list of benefit that could be gained from globalization, both by the countries \nof global south and north.\n Increased free trade between nations, \n Increased liquidity of capital allowing investors in developed nations to invest in developing nations, \n Corporations have greater flexibility to operate across borders, \n Global mass media ties the world together, \n Increased flow of communications allows vital information to be shared between individuals and corporations around the world, \n Greater ease and speed of transportation of goods and people, \n Reduction of cultural barriers increases the global village effect, \n Spread of democratic ideals to developed nations, \n Reduction of likelihood of war between developed nations, and \n Increases in environmental protection efforts in developed nations. \n5.2.4. Disadvantages of Globalization Decreased environmental integrity: Globalization has the potential to decrease \nenvironmental integrity as polluting corporations from well developed countries can take advantage of developing nations weak regulatory rules."

The concept of economic inequality between regions and countriesThe idea of inequality is both very simple and very complex. At one level it is the simplest of all ideas and has moved people with an immediate appeal hardly matched by any other concept. At the same time, is a very complex notion that  has been the subject of much research outputs by philosophers, statisticians, political theorists, sociologists and economists. From the ancient period to the present, theories have seen trade as a key instrument in determining the trend of regional and country economic inequality. Both the convergence and divergence hypotheses take it into account with their distinct assumptions and methodologies. The available evidence on trends in global economic inequality comes mainly from two types of studies. Studies of the first type have been concerned with empirically testing the catching-up or convergence hypothesis. This states that less developed countries and regions should be expected to grow faster than more developed ones.

Three main arguments have been advanced in support of the hypothesis. \n First, the latecomers into the world of modern economic growth enjoy an advantage because they can simply adopt and exploit technologies, which the pioneers had to develop through their own efforts. \n Second, assumption reflects there are diminishing returns to inputs factor. This implies less developed economies have an advantage of low production cost because of low labor wage and the price of other factor input. Thus, for equivalent rates of investment, the less developed economies should be able to achieve higher growth. \n Third, the shift of large amounts of labor from farm to industry boosts labor productivity in general. The importance of this source of productivity growth, however, declines with development as productivity tends to equalize across sectors and activities, and fewer and fewer workers remain in low-productivity \nNevertheless, widening income inequality is the defining challenge of our time. In advanced economies, the gap between the rich and poor is at its highest level in decades. Inequality trends have been more mixed in emerging markets and developing countries. Thus, the Second view investigates the divergent trends in inequality developments across advanced economies and developing countries, with a particular focus on the poor and the middle class. The pro-divergent notion primarily highlighted the rationale for this divergence as the countries' current experience. They practically demonstrate a diverging pattern of inequality. The follow -\ning are some of the evidences that support the greater divergent pattern of inequality.\n Inequality has been exacerbated by technological development and the associat -\ned increase in skill, as well as the collapse of various labor market institutions in both advanced economies and developing countries. \n The growing skill premiums are related with expanding income inequalities in advanced nations, whereas financial deepening is associated with rising inequality in developing countries.\n5.3.2. Cause and effect of trade imbalance \nAn important indicator of regional and national inequality is measuring the trade balance. A trade imbalance occurs when the cost of a country's imports exceeds the cost of its exports. It is one approach to measure international commerce, and it's also known as a negative trade balance. A country's trade deficit may be calculated by subtracting the entire value of its exports from the total value of its imports. The major causes and effect of this imbalance are stated below."

            "text": "UNIT \nONE\nUNIT \nONE\nUNIT FIVE\n136Causes: A trade imbalance happens when a country does not produce what it requires and \nmust borrow from other countries to pay for imports. This is referred to as a current account \ndeficit. A trade deficit also occurs when companies manufacture goods in other countries. The raw materials for manufacturing that are shipped overseas for factory production count as an export. The finished manufactured goods are counted as imports when they're shipped back to the country. The imports are subtracted from the country's gross domestic product even though the earnings may benefit the company's stock price, and the taxes may increase the country's revenue stream.\nEffects: A trade can enhance a country's standard of living since citizens can access a broader \nrange of goods and services at a lower cost. It can also reduce the threat of inflation since it creates lower prices. However, a trade imbalance may result in more job outsourcing to foreign countries over time. As a country imports more goods than it buys domestically, then the home country may create fewer jobs in certain industries. At the same time, foreign companies will likely hire new workers to keep up with the demand for their exports.   5.3.3. Measurement of countries and regional inequalities Economic inequality, in this context, measures the inequality between a percentage of population and the percentage of resources (such as income) received by that population. Inequality studies explore the levels of resource disparity and their practical and political implications. Though there are number of measures, the most often used metrics for evaluating global economic disparity is per capita GDP. The major characteristics or features that were considered in such assessment are listed below.\n Physical attributes – distribution of natural ability is not equal\n Personal Preferences – Relative valuation of leisure and work effort differs \n Social Process – Pressure to work or not to work varies across particular fields or disciplines \n Public Policy – tax, labor, education, and other policies affect the distribution of resources.\nMost people believed that economic disparity in Africa was quite modest and, at best, wasn't a significant barrier to reducing poverty until recently. Mostly because they are all generally impoverished. However, there was a general sense of concern when it was found that inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa was among the greatest in the world. The discrepancy can be seen in both income and non-income circumstances."

The Widening current global imbalance \nMeasures of inequality based on GINI coefficients of gross and net incomes have increased substantially since 1990 in most of the developed world (see figure 5.8). Inequality, on average, has remained stable in developing countries, Although at a much higher level than observed in advanced economies. However, there are large disparities across developing countries, with Asia and Eastern Europe experiencing marked increases in inequality, and countries in Latin America exhibiting notable declines (although the region remains the most unequal in the world). Income inequality of sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most unequal, despite low levels of per capita income. Inequalities in non-income dimensions of welfare are also high, particularly between men and women and between regions, and have remained persistent over time. Furthermore, although income inequalities are typically more of an urban phenomenon, asset-based and capability-based inequalities in fact tend to be higher in rural than urban areas. In countries where there is a significant initial income difference, economic growth is less effective at alleviating poverty. Economic expansion and inequality reduction must go hand in hand to significantly reduce poverty.

Do you think that corruption is one of the \nmajor factors that hamper the growth of your country?  \n2. Discuss why or why not depending on your response.\n5.4.1. The Concept of Corruption \nCurrently critical geography examines corruption as an objective collection of deviant actions predominantly affecting states, particularly in the Global South. It also illustrates how corruption explanations get politicized and interrelated with material, and geographical power regimes. For instance, urban informality is regarded as a significant linked issue in both the North and South.\nThe term corruption involves a wide range of behaviors differing in their causes and effects \nin different spatiotemporal contexts. Corruption may be defined in different ways, occurs in varying levels of severity, and takes various forms in time and space, depending on local political cultures and institutional frameworks. There is no one single definition of corruption that can be applied to all circumstances, for example, corruption can be petty or large-scale, systemic or occasional, implicit or explicit, committed by individuals. Similarly,  corruption defined as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. It also more commonly defined as evil, a disastrous personal failing. Legally, however, judicial systems punish acts, not character. In this view, corruption is a source of injustice and inequality. \nCorruption is simultaneously a political, economic, legal, and moral phenomenon.\nThe relationship between corruption and economic growth has been debated. Many studies have found evidence that corruption has harmful effects on economic growth. Corruption shows a negative correlation with economic growth after controlling for institutional efficiency. Furthermore, corruption causes uncertainty for investors and raises investment risk in nations with high levels of corruption.  \n5.4.2. Types of corruption\nCorruption can be categorized in various dimensions to facilitate the understanding of how corruption affects economic performance. The concept includes three broad categories of human action; bribery, theft of public assets, and patronage."

It consists of payments by individuals or \nfirms to public officials in order to influence administrative decisions under their responsibility. Bribery covers a wide range of administrative decisions, determined by the scope of government regulations and activity. It frequently overlaps with the other two corruption categories through the collusion of briber and bribe.\nTheft of public assets can occur as unilateral embezzlement by public officials or through \nthe collusion of public officials and private agents. Apart from the illegal transfer of real or financial public assets at below-market prices, it includes evasion of taxes and other legal payments to the public sector, as well as diversion of public funds from their intended use into private pockets.\nCorruption in the form of patronage (sometimes called favoritism, nepotism, clienteles) \nconsists of the preferential treatment of firms and/or individuals by public officials regarding the compliance with government rules for the allocation of government contracts or transfer payments. The private sector counterpart consists of “special favors” in the form of financial rewards or professional opportunities granted to the public official involved. \nAnother distinction is that an act of corruption, which can be characterized by the value of \nthe transaction concerned. Although this is a continuous variable, the analytical distinction usually made is between low value (“petty”) and large value (“grand”) corruption. Typically, the larger the value of the corrupt transaction, the higher the position in the public hierarchy of the public official(s) involved.\nVarious combinations of the characteristics detailed above have given rise to specific types of \ncorruption. Thus systematic theft at a grand scale by high public officials is called “kleptocracy”, while systematic patronage with large stakes has been labelled “crony capitalism” or “government capture”. “Kick-backs” describe acts of bribery that involve theft of public assets or patronage.\n5.4.3. Geography of Corruption\nCorruption has got a geographical essence because social processes are always distributed unevenly across space. The causes, nature, and consequences of corruption differ from place to place, depending on the context of historical, cultural, legal and political organization. The incidence of corruption is difficult to determine empirically because its committers are often adept at keeping it hidden."

The organizations produce annual corruption report with Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) of government misconduct, issued since 1995. The CPI is a composite indicator based on surveys and interviews with public and private sector officials in each country and expert assessments by 13 sources, including the different global, regional and national organizations. A minimum of three of these units contributed to the assessment of corruption in each country. Scores were normalized on an ordinal scale of zero (most corrupt) to 100 (least corrupt).\nTable 5.3 provides an overview of how the magnitude of corruption varies over the world. \nOnly a very small number of countries (including Canada, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand) have relatively uncorrupt governments, with CPI numbers of 80 or higher; however, this groups comprises a minuscule 1.7% of the world’s population. A secondary tier of slightly corrupt states (indices of 60–79), including several European countries, the United States, Japan, Botswana, Israel, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates) includes an additional one-eighth of the planet. Moderately corrupt governments (scores of 40–59) include a diverse array of European, African, Middle Eastern, and a few Asian states such as South Korea. By far the largest group almost three-fourths of humanity consists of very corrupt governments: 82 states with scores ranging between 20 and 39 account for more than 5.2 billion people. By this measure, corruption is the norm in most societies in the world. Finally, a small group of 1 4 states with scores below 20 may be said to be extremely corrupt; this group includes “failed states” such as Somalia, Afghanistan, and Yemen, which are incapable of delivering basic public services as well as several with long histories of extreme poverty (Haiti), war (Iraq), and totalitarian governments (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and North Korea).

Causes and consequences of corruption \nThough corruption differs from country to country, it is possible to identify some of the key common driving forces that generate it. The following are some of the attributes of the most corrupt countries\n6 With rare exceptions, they are low-income countries,\n6 Most countries have a closed economy,\n6 The influence of religion is visible,\n6 Low media freedom and,\n6 a relatively low level of education.\nThe effects of corruption were presented in different forms. Some of the very serious impacts of corruption on public finances could be illustrated as follows. \n1. Corruption increases the volume of public investments (at the expense of private investments), as there are many options that allow for public expenditure manipulation and are carried out by high-level officials so as to get bribes. That means, as government expenditures increase, opportunities for corruption is also increased.\n2. Corruption redirects the composition of public expenditure from the expenditure necessary for basic functioning and maintenance to expenditure on new equipment.\n3. Corruption tends to pull away the composition of public expenditure from the necessary fixed assets for health and education, as there is less chance of getting commissions than from other, perhaps unnecessary projects.\n4. Corruption reduces the effectiveness of public investments and the infrastructure of a country.\n5. Corruption can reduce tax revenues by compromising the ability of the state administration to collect taxes and fees, although the net effect depends on how the nominal tax and other regulatory burdens were selected by the officials, exposed to corruption.\nTherefore, the influence of corruption on the economy operates through several factors:\n Through the impact of corruption on investments;\n Through the influence of corruption on the allocation of talents;\n Through the impact of corruption on public spending; and\n Through the impact of corruption on taxes."

Remedial measures of corruption\nSome ideas and suggestions that have been put forth to fight system level corruption are as follows:\n Leadership: the top leadership must set a good example with respect to honesty, integrity and capacity for hard work. Since fighting corruption will involve taking difficult decisions, the leadership must also display firmness, political will and commitment to carry out the required reforms. But honest and dedicated leaders are a necessary.\n Credibility: The investigation and punishment must start from your group, it doesn’t bypass those who are within the leader’s party. For success, the offenders both on the demand and supply side of a corrupt deal must be convinced that the government is serious about fighting corruption. \n Involving people: A publicity campaign to create greater awareness on the adverse effects of corruption. Ordinary citizens have a lot of firsthand experience with corruption, they are a good source of information and their help and cooperation should be solicited for the successful launch of an anti-corruption drive. Once people are convinced that a sincere and genuine effort to combat corruption is underway, they will respond and extend their full cooperation in resolving the problem. \n Responsible press: A responsible press to gather, analyze, organize, present and disseminate information is considered vital to create greater public awareness and to provide the momentum for undertaking reforms to overcome corruption. \n Oversight bodies: Views on the effectiveness of anti-corruption oversight or watchdog bodies are mixed. There are instances where they have proved useful. Otherwise, the oversight bodies will be rendered useless or worse, misused for political gain. An unwelcome situation can then arise and the country may have to appoint a watchdog to watch over the watchdog body.\n Improving institutions: This involves such things as improving the legal framework; smoother, less time-consuming and less burdensome ways to conduct business in the functioning of law courts and in the administration of justice; promoting efficiency of the police force; strengthening the auditor general’s office; and appointment of a responsible inspector general empowered to investigate and prosecute corruption."

Globally, an estimated 150 million people and 25 million households are unable to pay for health care due to financial constraints. Only 12% of the $3.2 trillion spent on health care worldwide in 2002 was spent in low- and middle-income nations, which account for 90% of the world's illness burden.A health sectors aid increased by over 50 percent from 2002 and 2005, reflecting major increases by donor countries, including the United States, and the creation of new financing partnerships like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. Even with these notable increases, the level of funding for global health remains significantly below estimated needs. Faced with these tremendous financing challenges, policymakers are turning to innovative solutions to provide more and more effective aid for health.5.5.2. Historical global health problem Basically, in the realm of infectious diseases, a pandemic is the worst case scenario. When an epidemic spreads beyond a country’s borders, that’s when the disease officially becomes a pandemic. Communicable diseases existed during humankind’s hunter and gatherer days, but the shift to agrarian life 10,000 years ago created communities that made epidemics more possible. Malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, influenza, smallpox and others first appeared during this period. As people got more civilized, they began to establish cities and develop international trade routes to connect with other cities, as well as wage battles with them. As cities in many regions contact each other more, the conditions for the occurrence of worldwide pandemics become more likely.The Great Plague of Athens in 430BC, during the Peloponnesian War, was one of the key historical times where the first recorded pandemic occurred. After the disease passed through Libya, Ethiopia and Egypt, it crossed the Athenian walls as the Spartans laid siege. As much as two-thirds of the population died. The symptoms included fever, thirst, bloody throat and tongue, red skin and lesions. The disease, suspected to have been typhoid fever, weakened the Athenians significantly and was a significant factor in their defeat by the Spartans.\nFollowing this time and up to the 19 18 Spanish Flu pandemic, which was the most famous \npandemic in history, around 1 1 vastly accelerated pandemics were reported. In 19 18, Spanish Flu; The avian-borne Spanish flu that resulted in 50 million deaths worldwide, the 19 18 flu was first observed in Europe, the United States and parts of Asia before swiftly spreading around the world. At the time, there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat this killer flu strain. Wire service reports of a flu outbreak in Madrid in the spring of 19 18 led to the pandemic being called the “Spanish flu.” By October, hundreds of thousands of Americans died and body storage scarcity hit crisis level. But the flu threat disappeared in the summer of 19 19 when most of the infected had either developed immunities or died."

For effective implementation of global commitments and solutions to environmental challenges, there is a need to re-focus our development pathways. If the existing approach continues, countries will not be able to respond to the environmental challenges, thereby undermining the effective implementation of SDGs and other related global commitments. This unit tries to discusses about environmental problems, sustainability challenges, environmental education, environmental movement, and some of environment friendly indigenous knowledge. \n6.1. Environmental Problems\nAt the end of this section, you will be able to:\n explain the major environmental problems; and\n identify the major implication of environmental problems.  \nCurrently, environmental problems have become globalized in terms of their existence and impacts as well as the socioeconomic factors that generate them. This subsection discusses the nature of environmental problems and their global reach. Yet, while the problems are clearly global and affect human societies worldwide, it is obvious that some societies (and people) have contributed a hugely disproportionate share to our current problems and demands on the global ecosystem. Environmental analysts emphasize that the ecological footprints of poorer nations, and particularly the individual footprints of their citizens, are vastly lower than those of wealthy nations and their citizens. In both the academic and practical senses, interest in global environmental concerns has grown significantly in the aftermath of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992."

More significantly, it might be \nlinked to the realization that even the strongest national environmental policy cannot tackle all of these challenges on its own. The long-term character of the consequences, as well as the possibility of irreversible ecological harm, are to be sought in the diversity of political players, their competing interests, and so on. \nGlobal or universally occurring environmental problems can be approached in entirely different \nways. The globally interlinked environmental conditions essentially evaluated as a function of population, consumption and technology and the relationship of this factors often shown by the equation called \"environment formula\".  \nI = f (P,A,T)\nWhere I is global environmental impacts,  \nP is caused by world population growth, A is increasing affluence /consumption of goods and services, and T is environmentally unsound technology\nThis formula, in fact, had little effect on the formulation of practical policy, even though it \ndoes take into account the demographic, economic, and technological forces driving the degradation and destruction of the global environment (such as the ozone layer, climate, biodiversity, soils, water, and oceans). What has happened instead is that a medial structure of international environmental policy has emerged which more or less markedly integrates these driving forces or the intermedial link.\nSome of the major Global Environmental Problems discussed in this section include climate \nchange, ozone depletion, biodiversity loss, air and water pollution, and land degradation.\n6.1.1. Climate Change\nThe environmental problem most discussed at the moment is climate change (see also  unit 2 for  details). Climate change already has observable ecological and social effects, and its projected impacts could potentially result in profound changes in global mean surface temperature, sea level, ocean circulation, precipitation patterns, climatic zones, species distributions and ecosystem function. The climatically active Green House Gases are disrupting the earth’s thermal balance by partially blocking thermal radiation into outer space thus, intensified greenhouse effect. As you learned in Unit 2, governments all around the globe have proposed various mitigation and adaptation measures that have to be practiced by industries and each citizen of them to prevent the devastating impacts of climate change."

Ozone Layer Depletion\n The ozone (O3) layer  forms a barrier in the stratospheric layer (approximately 15 to 30 \nkilometers above the Earth's surface) thereby  protecting humanity from the sun's damaging UltraViolet (UV) rays. It became clear that the ozone layer is being depleted by ozone layer depletion substances such as chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). When an ozone layer is depleted, harmful ultra violet rays reach the Earth’s surface, causing health hazards such as skin cancer or cataracts. Ozone layer is being depleted globally except over tropical areas and the rate of depletion is higher in the highest latitude regions (Please take three and a half minutes to watch the accompanying video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU6pxSNDPhs).\nTherefore, by reducing emissions of ozone-depleting substances, the Montreal Protocol has \nprotected both the ozone layer and the climate at the same time. The approach used to reduce ozone depletion substances (ODS) is to replace them with fluorinated gases known as F-gases, which include hydrofluorocarbons (HFCS), perfluorocarbons (PFCS), and sulfur-hexafluoride (SF6).

Biodiversity Loss\nThe \"United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity\" was adopted by 154 states during the UN conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and came into effect in December 1993. This conveys the global community's recognition that environmental protection requires a far-reaching paradigm shift. The concept of biological diversity or biodiversity embraces all animal and plant species, including microorganisms, the genetic variability within the species, and the earth's ecosystems in which these species live together.Despite several international agreements on the conservation and wise use of biodiversity, natural ecosystem degradation and the loss of species linked with it continue rapidly. The main reason no doubt is that the approaches to international protection of nature and species previously adopted do not go far enough; and the situation is exacerbated by the lack of political will and of financial commitments needed to address it.

Within the NMVOCs, the perfume compounds benzene, toluene and xylene are suspected chemicals and may lead to leukemia through prolonged exposure. \nParticulates, alternatively referred to as particulate matter (PM), atmospheric particulate matter, \nor fine particles, are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas. In contrast, aerosol refers to particles and the gas together. Sources of particulates can be man-made or natural. Some particulates occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea spray. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants and various industrial processes also generate significant amounts of aerosols. Averaged over the globe, anthropogenic aerosols currently account for about 10 percent of the total amount of aerosols in our atmosphere. Increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease, altered lung function and lung cancer.\nSecondary Pollutant: Pollutants that are formed in the lower atmosphere by chemical \nreactions. Particulates are created from gaseous primary pollutants and compounds in \nphotochemical smog. Smog is a kind of air pollution; the word \"smog\" is a combination of smoke and fog. Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture of smoke and Sulphur dioxide.

Basically, water is able to dissolve more \nsubstances than any other liquid, this is the main reason why it is easily polluted. Toxic material emitted from farmyards, urban areas and industries simply mix with it thereby causing water pollution. When the contaminant is originated from a single source, we call the pollution point source pollution. When the pollutant comes from diffused sources, we call it nonpoint source pollution. Chemicals and heavy materials from industrial and municipal wastewater contaminate water ways as well. These contaminants are toxic to aquatic life most often reducing an organism’s life span and the ability to reproduce. \nFigure 6.3: Examples of water pollution\nDamage and depletion of the marine environment, which covers roughly 70% of the earth’s surface and more than 95% of the water system, has a substantial impact on the overall environmental balance. Pollutants from the land along the edge and interior portion of the continent have severely harmed the world's oceans and seas. Though chemicals, fertilizers, and heavy metals are the most common contaminants, plastic debris carried by rivers and winds is also a significant pollutant. Ocean \"dead zones” regions of the sea where oxygen is severely or entirely depleted and most forms of life cannot survive are becoming more numerous, and scientists warn that they will continue to increase unless we curb the factors driving global climate change, which is fueling this alarming shift in ocean chemistry. Even outside these near-lifeless ocean regions, rising global temperatures and invasions of nutrient pollution are regulating oxygen levels in the open ocean and in coastal areas, threatening communities of sea life around the world.Over the past 50 years, the ocean suffered from a loss of about 85 billion tons of oxygen, affecting an accumulated area approximately the size of the European Union. Globally, the amount of zero-oxygen ocean water has quadrupled, while the area occupied by low-oxygen zones has increased by 10 times. In coastal areas and seas that are semi-enclosed, once low-oxygen conditions are established, they can persist for thousands of years, according to some studies."

Land Degradation and Soil Contamination\nLand degradation is defined as a negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes including anthropogenic climate change, expressed as long-term reduction or loss of at least one of the following: biological productivity, ecological integrity, or value to humans. Land deterioration has been associated with mankind since the widespread introduction of agriculture during the Neolithic period, around 10,000 to 7 ,500 years ago. Land degradation has multiple and complex impacts on the global environment through a range of direct and indirect processes affecting a wide array of ecosystem functions and services. \nLand degradation is one of the world’s most pressing environmental problems and it will \nworsen without rapid remedial action. When land is degraded, soil carbon and nitrous oxide is released into the atmosphere, making land degradation one of the most important contributors to climate change.

The world population is projected to increase by about 35 percent to 9.7 billion in 2050, with rising demands for agricultural products including food, fiber, and fuel. As a result, pressure on the global land resource is increasing due to other factors as well, such as agricultural production systems made less resilient, and natural factors such as climate variability and extreme weather events. \nFigure 6.5: Views of Degraded land\nSoil pollution, on the other hand, is defined as the presence of harmful substances (pollutants or contaminants) at such amounts in a soil to endanger human health and/or the ecosystem. Soil contamination happens as a result of direct infection, such as raw material leaks owing to improper treatment, or indirectly through water pollution or air pollution induced by commercial operations. Once soil is contaminated, hazardous substances are deposited, causing a long-term contamination. In the case of contaminants which occur naturally in soil, even when their levels are not high enough to pose a risk, soil pollution is still said to occur if the levels of the contaminants in soil exceed the levels that should naturally be present. \nSoil pollution affects plants, animals and humans alike.

To put the recent growth in perspective, the world population in the year 1900 was only 1.6 billion and in 1960 it was 3.0 billion. According to UN, in 2030 the world population will be about 8.5 billion and in 2050 it will be  about 9.7 billion. Currently, 80 million people are being added every year in less developed countries, compared with about 1.6 million in more developed countries. Thus, populations are growing more rapidly in places where such growth cannot be afforded in many aspects.\nThe amount of bio-productive land and sea available to supply human needs is limited. As a \nconsequence of three-quarters of the land area being covered by seas, half of the terrestrial land being desert, and more than a quarter being high mountain ranges, relatively few locations are available for comfortable human settlement. It is believed that just one-eighth of the Earth’s surface is suitable for human habitation. Currently, the approximately 1 1.2 billion hectares of productive earth, divided by the 6.3 billion people who depend on it for their wellbeing, results in an average of approximately 1.8 hectares per person. Collectively, we are currently using approximately 2.2 hectares per person or over 20% more than is produced annually, which means that the population has already exceeded the sustainable limit."

The world’s urban population reached 2.9 billion in 2000 andis expected to increase by 2.1 billion by 2030. This will make up roughly 60 percent of theworld’s population.\nPopulation growth coupled with urbanization results in significant impacts on the environment\nand other problems, which include:\nÞ increased ambient temperature, \nÞ decreased air quality, \nÞ increased water run-off, \nÞ decreased quality of run-off water, \nÞ altered weather patterns, \nÞ loss of natural beauty, \nÞ reduction in farmlands and subsequent food shortage, and \nÞ deforestation.\nEnergy use and global warmingThere is a broad relation between wealth and energy consumption.

The OECD brings together 38 Member countries and a range of partners that collaborate on key global issues at national, regional and local levels.\nFigure 6.8: Global energy consumption per head (2021)\nThough greenhouse effect occurs naturally atmospheric concentrations of some of the gases that produce the greenhouse effect are increasing due to human activity causing global warming. Over one-third of human-induced greenhouse gases come from the burning of fossil fuel to generate electricity. All fossil fuels are made up of hydrocarbons and they release carbon dioxide when burned\nWater scarcity\nAccording to the United Nations, one out of every six people do not have access to safe drinking water, and more than double that number do not have access to adequate sanitation. Only approximately 2.5 percent of the Earth’s water is fresh water, and three-quarters of it is locked up in glaciers and permanent snow cover. Only 0.3 percent of water is surface water found in rivers and lakes, and therefore easily accessible. Throughout the world, both the ground and surface water is being used at a faster rate than it is being replenished.

The term usually relates to materials produced by human activity and is generally undertaken to reduce their effect on health, aesthetics or as an amenity. Waste management is also carried out to reduce the effect of the material(s) on the environment and to recover resources from them. Waste management can involve solid, liquid or gaseous substances, with different methods and processes for each of them. Various methods are used for waste man -\nagement which include disposal (landfill and incineration), recycling (physical and biological processing), energy recovery, and avoidance and reduction.\nEvery year, the globe generates 2.01 billion tons of municipal solid garbage, with at least \n33% of that waste not being managed in an ecologically sustainable manner. The amount of garbage created per person every day in the world averages 0.75 kilograms but ranges from 0.1 1 to 4.54 kilograms. Despite accounting for only 16% of the worldwide population, high-income nations create 34% or 683 million tons of global garbage. The trend also reveals that global waste is predicted to rise to 3.4 billion tons by 2050. \n6.2.2. Sustainable solutions\nThe aforementioned environmental concerns and sustainability challenges sparked arguments regarding the remedial actions that must be implemented to prevent future deterioration of the environment. Despite the fact that scientists and environmentalists have documented the extent and severity of these environmental problems for decades, little progress has been made in meeting the objectives. Aside from that, sustainable solutions to environmental challenges are frequently neglected in favor of technical processes. A number of solutions have been suggested and some have been successfully implemented in the past in several countries to produce clean energy and to maintain sustainability. Some of these solutions are described below. \nCombating climate change\nReduction in change of climate and impacts of global warming is urgently required for present as well as the future. Various types of measures are taken for combating climate change and global warming, and microbes have great potential to do the task."

For example, oceans are known as the largest carbon reservoir on the earth and consume about one-third of all human carbon emissions. It is reported that about half of the carbon dioxide on the earth is fixed by cyanobacteria and other ocean microbes’ mainly through photosynthesis and can be converted into carbon-rich lipids which can be used for biofuel production. Apart from many governmental and non-governmental groups' attempts at GHG (Greenhouse as Reduction)  through institutional reasoning, multiple awareness campaigns and local green moments are also significant. Global warming can also be mitigated by preserving ecologically significant regions, developing environmentally friendly energy and waste management systems, and employing biofuels. \nRole in sustainable agriculture\nThe fertility of soil is a parameter not only confined to availability of nutrients but also the microbial flora flourishing in the soil. Soil microorganisms maintain the fertility of agro-ecosystems, and sustain the crop productivity by maintaining the ecological balance. But the problem is that due to heavy input of chemicals in agro-ecosystems, several of these beneficial microbes are getting depleted or extinct from the soil. Aside from the drawbacks of using chemical fertilizers and pesticides, there is a need to introduce beneficial soil microorganisms into both damaged and unaffected agro-ecosystems in order to increase yields in an environmentally acceptable manner.\nRenewable Energy\nThough a number of alternative proposals have been given for meeting the growing energy demands of the world, the renewable energy power plant more appealing one is solar. One of these examples is solar chimney. The solar chimney consists of three essential elements - glass roof collector, chimney and wind turbine. Air is heated in a very large circular structure similar to a greenhouse, and the resulting convection causes the air to rise and escape through a tall tower. The moving air drives turbines, which produce electricity. This type of power plant provides enormous amount of energy with no ecological breakdown at minimal cost (most poor countries cannot afford environmental protection), and without safety hazards (unlike nuclear power plants).Above all, there is no depletion of natural resources at the expense of future generations. Many countries are excessively provided with solar radiation in their deserts. There are also numerous technologies and schemes that have been created using such renewable energy sources or in an environmentally friendly manner, such as solar, wind farm, hydropower, and geothermal, as well as the waste recycling energy process."

What is the very essence of environmental education? \n2. What are the main implications of improving environmental education? \nThe primary goals of environmental education are to develop an ecologically educated population that is self-assured and motivated to take action on critical environmental challenges ranging from climate change to habitat protection and from endangered species to water shortages. Environmental education is about engaging students, community members, policy makers, the young and the old. It is about empowerment, skills development, and providing opportunities for action. At its best, environmental education represents hope and change. It is a strategy by which people can make proactive, informed decisions that honor ecological, economic, and social integrity as the foundations of sustainability. With its emphasis on instilling these values to guide our individual and communal actions, environmental education allows everyone to work toward a better quality of life.\n6.3.1. The Essence of Environmental Education \nMost simply, environmental education is education in, about, and for the environment. Environmental education, which researchers have described broadly as an “approach, a philosophy, a tool, and a profession,” is built on the following three goals:  \n To foster clear awareness of, and concern about, economic, social, political, and ecological interdependence in urban and rural areas;Brainstorming Activity 6.3"

Environmental education is said to be formal or informal (or non-formal), sometimes it could be tacit knowledge where “formal” refers to education that occurs in a traditional school setting and “informal” refers to education in broader public settings such as zoos, aquariums, or community centers and through media outlets such as the Internet or television documentaries. Tacit knowledge refers to learning from the actions of others, or it is a type of information that we may obtain implicitly by living together, contacts or socializing without any teaching.\nEnvironmental education also uses a range of strategies and teaching techniques, which can be \nused separately but ideally built one upon the other. Education researchers basically describe this continuum as including:\n Information activities, which aim to increase awareness and understanding and are defined as “informal” education.\n Communication activities, delivered in both formal and informal settings, which aim to establish a dialogue between audiences and environmental organizations or agencies for the mutual sharing of experiences, priorities, and planning.\n Education activities, also delivered in both formal and informal settings, which aim to promote knowledge, understanding, an attitude of concern, and the motivation and capacity to work with others in achieving goals.\n Capacity building activities, delivered primarily in informal settings, which aim to increase the capacity of civil society to support and work for environmental preservation.\nIn practice, environmental education is intended to exemplify sound education principles based on sound pedagogy and sound science. It is hands-on, contextualized, and interdisciplinary, linking natural and social sciences, the arts, and mathematics, among other subjects, to address complex and multifaceted environmental issues."

Fundamental Characteristics of Environmental Education\nBasically, Environmental Education encompasses the following main characteristics: \nEnvironmental education is lifelong learning: Environmental education is a life-long \nstrategy that involves everyone, encouraging them to connect with the natural environment \nand, when necessary, to take action to safeguard it. While youth undoubtedly represent a critical audience for environmental education, it is equally important to nurture and support environmental literacy among adults whose daily consumer behaviors and political actions can have impressive impacts on the environment and conservation. In recognition of this fact, environmental education involving employees, policy makers, clergy, community activists, parents and grandparents, and members of the media, among others, is on the rise. These groups play important roles in decision-making about environmental conservation both today and in the future. So, in addition to schools, informal settings such as zoos, aquariums, museums, community centers, and parks, as well as media outlets including the Internet, radio, magazines, and newspapers all are important avenues for environmental education. \nEnvironmental education is interdisciplinary: The science, notably geography, ecology, \nand others, give vital foundations for understanding environmental concerns, but environmental education is, by definition, social in nature. Environmental education is about human behavior, focusing on human interactions with the world around us, and encouraging people to engage in productive dialogue and decision-making with an emphasis on positive environmental behavior, critical thinking, and citizen participation. In other words, Environmental education is more about altering people's thinking setups, and they learn more by imitating the activities and performances of certain idol individuals around them. \nWithin a formal, or school setting, environmental education comprises a variety of subjects. \nHere, social studies, government studies, and history are as important as geography, biology, chemistry, and physics in addressing today’s complex environmental problems. The origins of environmental education may be traced back to the 18th century, when Jean-Jacques Rousseau emphasized the necessity of an environment-focused education. As a result of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl in the 1920s and 1930s, conservation education emerged as a new kind of environmental education."

Thus, the  policy tools of regulation and market incentives proves insufficient to the task of coping with significant environmental management problems. Managers and policy makers must turn ever more frequently to other policy options, including education, information provision, and voluntary measures. Although increased education does not equate with behavior change, a strong link between the two can often be found, as education plays an important role in increasing knowledge, honing critical thinking skills, and enhancing the capacity and motivation to take action. Thus, supporting environmental education represents an investment in the future. Well-designed environmental education initiatives are built around a theory of change, the idea that a logical series of events may be used to demonstrate how activities in the present may lead to the achievement of goals and objectives in the future. Although it may be easier in the short run to see the direct impact of legislation passed or an acre of trees planted, an environmental-education initiative can make a much longer-term impact on environmental attitudes, knowledge, skills, and action by preparing people to support those policies or become involved in the replanting efforts. \nEnvironmental education is about critical thinking and citizen participation:  Good \nenvironmental education is about teaching people how to think, not what to think. Rather \nthan advocating for specific positions, environmental education contextualizes environmental issues within a complex ecological, social, and economic framework. Environmental education encourages people to take an active role in environmental problem-solving by helping to develop citizen-action skills, then providing opportunities for taking action. But, because education around hot-button issues such as the environment can be controversial, developing high quality standards for both teaching materials and professional training is essential to maintaining the integrity of the field.\nReflective Activity 6.4\n1.

Environmental movements \nAt the end of this section, you will be able to:\n describe the historical development of environmental movements; and\n participate in or initiate environmental movement aimed at addressing environ-\nmental threats caused by human activities at local or national level.\n6.4.1. The Concept of Environmental MovementEnvironmental movement is a type of social movement that involves an array of individuals, groups and coalitions that perceive a common interest in environmental protection and act to bring about changes in environmental policies and practices.\nThe environmental movements are conceived as broad networks of people and organizations \nengaged in collective action in the pursuit of environmental benefits. Environmental movements are understood to be very diverse and complex, their organizational forms ranging from the highly organized and formally institutionalized to the radically informal; the spatial scope of their activities ranging from the local to the almost global, and the nature of their concerns ranging from single issue to the full panoply of global environmental concerns. Such an inclusive conception is consistent with the usage of the term amongst environmental activists themselves and enables us to consider the linkages between the several levels and forms of what activists call ‘the environmental movement. \nThe movement may also be initiated by any group or individuals from anywhere. For example, \nGreta Thunberg is a significant young climate change campaigner whose voice has the potential to impact many worldwide decision-making bodies, both governmental and non-governmental (take some about four minutes to watch her emotional and influential speech in one of the international climate action summits https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9KxE4Kv9A8 ).  \n6.4.2. Types of Environmental Movements\n      1. Free market environmentalism      2. Preservation and conservation      3. Popular environmentalism      4.

Environmental care is regarded as natural, as is the expulsion of polluters and other aggressors by individual and class action.\nPreservation and conservation\nEnvironmental preservation is viewed as the strict setting aside of natural resources to prevent damage caused by contact with humans or by certain human activities, such as logging, mining, hunting, and fishing.  It differs from conservation in that conservation allows for some degree of industrial growth while keeping it within sustainable bounds. Regulations and laws may be enacted for the preservation of natural resources. Elsewhere in the world the terms preservation and conservation may be less contested and are often used interchangeably.\nPopular Environmentalism\nEnvironmentalist action has recently led to the development of a new subculture. It is mainly composed of the educated middle and upper-class. This subculture often exhibits sustainable consumption patterns, choosing local and organic product over the more conventionally imported products that have been manufactured using chemicals such as pesticides and preservatives. Criticism of this 'green consumerism' comes from some environmentalists who complain of elitism, suggesting that this is nothing more than shopping under the banner of environmentalism without espousing any of its true ideals. Because organic and sustainable items are sometimes more expensive, purchasing them may be perceived as a sign of affluence. It is suggested that this new tendency has diverted attention away from the fundamental issues that 'serious' environmentalists want to tackle. Consumer items offer a deceptively easy, feel-good way to both save the world and one's reputation simultaneously. Others, however, argue that practicing green consumerism does not always imply that these consumers are just trying to save money. Simultaneously, many people believe that the cost of environmentally friendly products should be reduced.\nLight Greens, Dark Greens and Bright Greens\nContemporary environmentalists are often described as being split into three groups, ‘Light’, ‘Dark’ and ‘Bright’ Greens. Light Greens see protecting the environment first and foremost as a personal responsibility.  They fall in on the reformist end of the spectrum introduced above, but light Greens do not emphasize environmentalism as a distinct political ideology, or even seek fundamental political reform. Instead they often focus on environmentalism as a lifestyle choice. The motto “Green is the new black.” sums up this way of thinking, for many. In contrast, dark greens believe that environmental problems are an inherent part of industrialized capitalism, and seek radical political change."

Dark Greens claim that this is caused by the emphasis on growth that exists within all existing ideologies, a tendency referred to as ‘growth mania’.  \nMore recently, a third group may be said to have emerged in the form of Bright Green.  This \ngroup believes that radical changes are needed in the economic and political operation of society in order to make it sustainable, but that better designs, new technologies and more widely distributed social innovations are the means to make those changes and that we can neither shop nor protest our way to sustainability. Bright green environmentalism is less about the problems and limitations we need to overcome than the “tools, models, and ideas” that already exist for overcoming them. \n6.4.3. Environmental Movements in Ethiopia\nEnvironmental activism or movements are rarely seen in Ethiopia in a well-organized way. In many sociopolitical problems, different trends have been noticed in both contemporary and pre-existing social media and networking that can have significant social and political consequences.\nThough several initiatives have been undertaken in various organizations to include \nenvironmental problems into the mainstreaming process (such as governmental ministries, religious and other civic organizations), some organizations are particularly concerned with the environment and associated issues only. Lem Ethiopia is an example of a well-known organization in this field. Lem, the Environment and Development Society of Ethiopia (LEM Ethiopia), was founded in 1992 by 29 prominent Ethiopian professionals working in the fields of environment and development. The Society aims to promote sustainable development, and therefore is involved in areas such as natural resource management and appropriate technology promotion, urban waste management and livelihood security in collaboration with donors, government institutions, local and international NGOs and communities. It engages in capacity building, with special attention given to environmental education and awareness interventions that target school children, teachers, farmers, urban dwellers, men, women and development practitioners to impact climate change and advocate for environmental protection policies.\nSome individual based attempts were seen with an ad hoc, and discontinuous patterns.

When applied to knowledge it’s central concept is negotiation. \n Indigenous knowledge is characteristically shared to a much greater degree than other forms of knowledge. As a result, it is frequently referred to as \"people's science\"."

Besides, these people can get these medicines so long as they protect their environment.\nPractices of dry high land landscape in the south, Terracing: The Konso Cultural Landscape is \ncharacterized by extensive dry stone terraces which witnesses hundreds of years of persistent human struggle to harness the hard, dry and rocky environment, which has resulted in the beautifully outlined rows of dry stone terrace. The terraces retain the soil from erosion, collect maximum water and discharge the excess, and create terrace saddles that are used for agriculture. The terraces are the main features of the Konso landscape and the hills are contoured by the dry stone terraces that could reach at some places up to 5 meters high. The dry stone walled towns (Paleta) of the Konso are located on high hills selected for their strategic and defensive advantage. These towns are circled by, between one and six rounds of dry stone defensive walls, built using locally available rock.\nThe Gedeo people are founded on long-standing regulations (seera) of standards, respect to \nelders, and oral declarations passed down from generation to generation. Particularly, respect is an important social value among the Gedeo community."

Respect is frequently exhibited in the form of reverence for parts of environmental resources because it is linked with traditions and relationship to humans. For instance, songo sacred trees are often seen as ritualistic trees which are maintained and protected by prohibition systems (taboos) and traditional rules of “seera”. In the mores of Gedeo, respect is translated into attitudes such as respecting elder person in villages, not cutting songo sacred trees (Dhadacha), not injuring sacred forests, not felling young and immature plants from farms, not cutting grave trees for house uses, killing birds murdering of human-being, defecation in sacred natural sites, degrading the reputation of cultural elders and mass-cutting of trees (degradation) from indigenous cultural landscapes (agroforestry) have been considered as disrespectful deeds and perjuring of ancestral rules of “seera”.\nPractices of western lowland dry lands, The Gumuz have special relationships with their lands \nand the environment. They possess knowledge about their natural resources and environment based on observation and experience.Indigenous knowledge is important to the Gumuz systems of natural resource management and it can be best understood along with their traditional belief systems. The Gumuz hold the belief that vital natural/land resources are sacred. They believe that natural resources are the ingenuous gift, blessing and creation of Yamba (the supreme deity), which is the source of life and livelihoods to the past, present and future generations. Yamba provided the Gumuz with knowledge of proper use, management and a responsibility of passing the natural resources to the next generation. The different resources have their respective Missa (poly-spirits) that ensure their proper use and management; violations result in severe punishments and revenge from the respective Missa.\nMoreover, the Gumuz perceive their natural resources as an ancestral heritage. Ownership \nof natural resources is vested upon the whole community. The present generation runs a responsibility of trusteeship over the resources. Since natural resources do not belong to only one generation, they cannot be privately possessed or controlled by any single members of the community, only its fruits. Shifting cultivation is an indigenous agro-ecological knowledge used to maintain the complex agro-ecosystem. The fields are shifted to use the nutrients of the natural vegetation-soil complex. Thus, by skillfully maintaining the natural forest and vegetation ecosystem, the other equally important natural resource components such as soil, water and wild animals are managed in a sustainable way."

Environmental protection is a practice of protecting the natural environment on the individual, organizational or governmental levels, for the benefit of both the environment and humans.  \nThe problem of environmental sustainability has proven to be difficult to overcome. The shift \nto a more sustainable way of life is being hampered by human actions that continue to harm the environment. The modern environmental movement has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. \nEnvironmental education refers to organized efforts to teach how natural environments \nfunction, and particularly, how human beings can manage behavior and ecosystems to live sustainably. It is a multi-disciplinary field integrating disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, ecology, earth science, atmospheric science, mathematics, and geography.\nEnvironmental movement, addresses environmental issues via lobbying, education, and \nactivism. It is a broad philosophical, social, and political movement for solving environmental challenges that includes conservation and green politics. Environmentalists fight for just and sustainable resource management and environmental stewardship through public policy and individual behavior changes.\nEnvironmentally friendly indigenous practices describes indigenous and other traditional \nknowledge about local resources. It is concerned with the interactions between living beings (including humans) and their traditional groups as well as their surroundings. It is important to note that indigenous knowledge is not a universal concept among various societies, but it refers to a set of knowledge traditions or practices that are highly influenced by “location.”  Such knowledge is employed in natural resource management as a supplement to scientific methods of ecological management or as a substitute for baseline environmental data in circumstances where there is little recorded scientific data."

Definition of Desert and Desertification\nDeserts are defined as areas of the Earth that get a little or no rain, often 250mm or less per year which is different from the idea of desertification. Desertification does not concern natural deserts, and can only occur on land which is vulnerable to the desertification process.  The phenomenon known as desertification has received widespread attention recently, as witnessed in the United Nations Conference on Desertification in Nairobi in 1977 , mainly as a result of the impact of extended drought in the West African Sahel in the early 1970s. Today, the UN definition of desertification is that it is ‘human induced land degradation in dry and sub-humid regions’ (UNCCD: United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification). By definition, human induced land degradation, refers to how desertification is caused by the actions of people that have a negative impact on the condition of the environment. \nAccording to IPCC special report on climate change and land, desertification is land degradation \nin arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas, collectively known as drylands, resulting from many factors, including human activities and climatic change."

Drylands currently cover about 46.2% of the global land area and are home to 3 billion people. The multiplicity and complexity of the processes of desertification make its quantification difficult. Desertification hotspots, as identified by a decline in vegetation cover, extended to about 9.2% of drylands in between the 1980s and 2000s, affecting about 500 million people in 2015. The highest number of people affected are in the South and East Asia, the Sahara region including North Africa, and the Middle East. \nDesertification, even if viewed as a subset of the general land degradation problem, has \nundoubtedly proved to be controversial, especially since the 1977 . The term has been seen as confusing, as it is grouping together a range of environmental processes and because of the images it presents, an inappropriate images of desert advance through sand dunes encroaching upon productive land. \n7 .2.2. Characteristics and Surface Area of the World’s Drylands\nThe dry lands are comprised of arid, semiarid and sub-humid areas, the difference being in their degree of aridity. Aridity is the result of the interaction between various climatic factors (rain, temperature, wind) and evapotranspiration. These elements combine together to determine the growth of plants and the capacities of animals or humans to live fittingly in a harsh natural environment. Almost half of the terrestrial land surface, equal to 6.45 billion hectares, is made up of drylands (47% according to the World Atlas of Desertification, UNEP 1997). They are distributed among all the great regions of the planet. One billion hectares is hyper-arid; these are real deserts such as the Sahara.\nGenerally, 5.45 billion hectares of land are arid, semi-arid and sub-humid areas. Desertification \noccurs in these parts of the planet. These areas are inhabited by one fifth of the world’s population or 1.2 billion inhabitants in the year 2000. It is here where the soils are fragile, vegetation is sparse and the climate is difficult that helps to expand desertification. Land degradation occurs everywhere, but can only be defined as ‘desertification’ when it occurs in the drylands. Some 70% of the 5.2 billion hectares of drylands used for agriculture around the world are already degraded. Thus, desertification now damages practically one quarter of the total land surface area of the world and it also affects about two-thirds of the countries of the world."

Causes of Desertification\nAn obvious starting point when considering the causes of desertification is the increase in the human population from about 1 million in the Stone Age to 1 billion in 1850 and 6 billion in the 1990s. \nDesertification and land degradation have emerged as a significant and seemingly permanent \nissue as a result of the combined effects of technology, human population expansion, and cultural shifts. Therefore, man is one of may be the 3 million species but today consumes far more food than all of the other land animals put together. Ever since people started to use fire to improve grazing and domesticate crops and cattle, land degradation and desertification occurred, and this happened everywhere.

Increase in agricultural pressure on land, with the added effect that the soil in the drylands is not given sufficient time to recover, leads to an eventual drop in productivity. Basically human action, ironically, is necessary to restore damaged areas. That means, people have the potential to devastate the environment as well as the ability to heal and rehabilitate it.\nb. Over-exploitation of natural resources\nDue to the lack of alternative survival strategies, farmers tend to relentlessly exploit natural resources (food crops, water for drinking and washing, firewood) to the point that they are often over-exploited and cannot regenerate naturally. Soil nutrients and organic matter begin to diminish as intensive agriculture removes quantities of nutrients greater than the soil’s natural regeneration capacities. As a result, the soil does not recover as quickly as it does during fallow periods. This traps it in a vicious cycle of environmental deterioration and poverty, both of which are major contributors to desertification.\nOver-cultivation exhausts the soil, overgrazing removes the vegetation cover that protects \nit from erosion. The causes are multiple and interact in a complex manner. The principal causes exacerbating land degradation derives from the farmers’ determination to maximize soil productivity, which include:\n Crops cultivated in areas at high risk from drought. \n Shortening of crop cycles and the reduction of fallow periods. \n Insufficient use of fertilizer after harvesting.\n Inadequate crop rotation or worse, monoculture.\n Intensive labor.\n Intense breeding and overgrazing with pressure on vegetation and soil trampling by livestock.\n Separation of cattle rearing and agriculture, eliminating a source of natural fertilizer or organic matter (cattle dung) used to regenerate the soil.\n Deforestation.\n Bush and forest fires.\n In mountainous regions, crops are cultivated along the downward sloping face rather than following the natural contour lines of the mountain.\n Deterioration of terraces and other soil and water conservation techniques"

In tropical arid areas, wood is the principal source of domestic energy for cooking and lighting both in rural and urban areas, and it is also used for construction. In this way, large tracts of forest are destroyed. Due to the lack of water in the drylands, forest regeneration is very slow, reducing the dynamic growth of vegetation. \nHowever, allowing for rest periods from grazing and increasing fallow periods, generally have spectacular regenerating effects on the forest. In the drylands, this regeneration is very slow because of water scarcity. Thus, deforestation is a major cause of desertification.  To limit the need for deforestation, only renewable sources of energy (hydraulic, wind, solar) and gas and petrol should be encouraged as it can replace wood consumption \nFigure 7 .4.

Do climate change and deforestation cause desertification? \nThe climate of the planet has changed over the course of history (see Chapter Two). Variations in arid and humid climates have been observed in most regions of the world. Thus, a desert today could have been a humid and fertile zone in the past, and is still in the process of evolving. Moreover, today’s forests originally developed from low-lying vegetation made up of grasses and shrubs. However, if humans continue to over-exploit forest resources and influence the climate by gas emissions, who knows what will remain of the forests in the next few decades.Global and regional variations in temperature at the ocean surface are directly linked to rain cycles. This is the case of the phenomenon known as ‘El Nino’ whose persistent and devastating rains affect the eastern coast of the Americas, Asia and even Africa. As a result of this situation, the area may be warm by at least several degrees Celsius.  Deforestation, Overgrazing and over cultivation on grass lands in semi-arid areas cause similar changes in albedo, leading to an increase in desert conditions, a process known as desertification.\n7 .2.4. The Consequences of Desertification \nBillions of acres of the world’s range and cropland, along with the welfare of millions of people, have been affected by desertification in recent decades. One of the main causes is believed to be overgrazing, although over cultivation, poor irrigation practices, and deforestation also play a significant role. Some of the major effects of desertification is given below. \nDesertification decreases the resilience of the land to natural climatic change. Thus, soil, \nvegetation, freshwater supplies, and other resources’ efficiency and viability are all affected. Soil becomes less productive as a result of topsoil erosion, which can be blown away by wind or washed away by rainstorms. When pastures are overgrazed, edible plant species may go extinct, and non-edible plant species may invade the area. Some of the consequences are caused by people who live outside of the impacted areas. Downstream flooding has resulted in decreased water quality due to sedimentation in rivers and lakes, silt sediment in reservoirs and navigation channels, dust storms, and sand drifting, are a few instances. Food production will suffer greatly if desertification is not prevented and the area’s food yields are not restored. Many of the nations impacted by desertification, malnutrition, hunger, and disaster are all conceivable results. Desertification often adds to famine in regions where there is also poverty, civil disturbance or conflict. Drought and land degradation often help to trigger a crisis, which is then made worse by poor food distribution and the inability to buy what is available.  Desertification has huge societal consequences, including land degradation, drought, population migration, wars, and conflict over freshwater."

Increasing concentration of poverty in the drylands of sub-Saharan Africa has been documented, where 41% of the total population lives in extreme cases. This is mainly because of desertification. Thus, desertification is one of the most severe concerns and risks to Africa’s long-term development.\nThe sub-region of East Africa lies between 21\n0 North latitude and 1 10 South latitude in the \nTropics.  It includes nine countries Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, \nUganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. The Sahara Desert has a significant influence on this region, making it relatively dry. Desert covers more than 1 million square kilometers, including all of the northern Sudan. The climate is characterized by high temperatures and low precipitation (less than 200 mm). Very arid and semi-arid climates are also found in Somalia, Djibouti and along the coast of Eritrea, with annual rainfall ranging between 400mm and 750 mm. Most of Ethiopia and the mountains of Kenya have mountain climates with higher rainfall and lower temperatures. Uganda and the coast of the United Republic of Tanzania are mostly characterized by a very humid climate with high temperatures and a very short dry season. The rest of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda have typical tropical climate with a long dry season."

Desertification has already proven to be one of the key challenges affecting the livelihoods of the poor people of the region. Most of the people in this region are living predominantly in rural areas where their lifestyles are traditional peasants relying heavily on land for livelihood.The governments have to try and export little to earn foreign exchange which is used to import much needed machinery,Mineral fuels, manufactured goods, chemicals, etc. Little revenue is therefore left to be used in developing and providing the needs of the growing population. It is in this context that the population of East Africa is seen as growing faster than their economies can provide for.\nFeatures of desertification in Eastern Africa \nThis section provides a few examples of desertification process in eastern African countries and the consequences thereof. In Tanzania, population pressure from both man and anima1 is causing moderate to high land degradation. Along with that, roughly 45 percent of the country’s entire territory has already been impacted, with another 35 percent under threat. The semiarid   Sukumaland Sindiga, Gogoland and Masai steppe are the most affected areas that are taken as an example.Figure 7 .5. The extent of desertification particularly in Eastern  Africa"

Accordingly, each household in a settled situation uses about 200 trees or bushes a year. They indicate that the introduction of agriculture in the 450-650 mm rain zone has accelerated desertification in the Western Sudanese region.\nIn the case of Ethiopia, the experience is the same as that in Sudan particularly in the north, \nnortheast and southeast areas but the condition is aggravated by lack of political stability and recurrent war in its marginal areas. Uganda, which is known as the “Pearl of Africa,” has seen significant forest loss, causing environmental destruction. One of the major causes of this is rapid population growth. Kenya is also threatened by desertification especially in its grazing marginal lands which cover 85% of the country. The worst hit are the Kerio Valley Development Authority areas, much of Eastern and North Kenya and Kajiado areas of South Kenya. Severe sedimentation in manmade dams, notably along the Tana River, threatens the usefulness of these hydropower plants. This is one of the major causes of climate change and destruction of natural vegetation. \nAttempts to combat desertification in Eastern Africa \nNational efforts to combat desertification: They include the recent creation of Presiden-tial Commission on Soil Erosion and Afforestation in Kenya. The starting of a tree nursery in each district of the countries, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia and the designation of a day as a national tree planting day. Thirdly, the local agricultural extension officers are to be more active in encouraging proper agricultural practices. Ethiopian ‘green legacy’ is a typical example in this respect. \nInternational projects: Though it is no longer active, UNESCO’s Integrated Project on Arid \nLands began in 197 6 in Kenya as a pilot project of research, training, and demonstration. Its primary task was to find direct solutions to the more urgent environmental problems associated with desert encroachment and ecological degradation of arid lands. It was then to develop new strategies for pastoral land management and regional development. This program’s task is to find scientific management principles to the environment and to use these findings to improve living conditions of the people. The principal objective of it is to enhance production in the agricultural and forestry industries, followed by increased productivity and stress tolerance."

Types of Drought\nIt is a common practice to distinguish between three forms of drought; meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts. These categories are usually, but incorrectly, viewed as synonymous.\na. Meteorological Drought\nIt describes a situation where there is a reduction in rainfall for a specified period (day, month, season, or year) below a specified amount – usually defined as some proportion of the long term average for the specified  period of time. Its definition involves only precipitation statistics. Care needs to be taken in utilizing and aggregating rainfall data. \nThe word “drought” is most commonly used to refer to meteorological drought. Efforts have \nbeen made to design a universal definition of meteorological drought that would fit all localities and situations. These definitions reflect climatic abnormalities, and are based on a deficit of rainfall from a conversion long-term average. That means Meteorological drought occurs when precipitation is significantly below expectations. Its definition involves only precipitation statistics and depends on the time of year and on location.\nb. Hydrological Drought\nIt involves a reduction in water resources (stream flows, lake levels, groundwater, and underground aquifers) below a specified level for a given period of time. Its definition involves data on availability and offtake rates in relation to the normal requirements of the system (domestic, industrial, irrigated agricultural) being supplied. \nThe distinction between the two types can often be blurred as hydrological droughts may \nbe caused by reductions in precipitation anywhere within the catchment area of the river or aquifer system. Thus, irrigated agricultural areas alongside the River Nile in Egypt may experience a hydrological drought as a result of a meteorological drought in the Ethiopian Highlands regardless of the levels of rainfall within Egypt itself. In the case of rivers fed by snowmelt, irrigated areas downstream may experience reduced water availability as a result of reduced snowmelt caused by below normal temperatures during the summer months. \nAreas drawing water from underground aquifers through wells and boreholes may experience \nhydrological drought as a result of geological changes which cut off parts of the aquifer. Overutilization of the aquifer may also result in its exhaustion."

An agricultural drought depends on the amount of rainfall expected and the use to which water is put, hence a shortage of water is felt because of human activity, whereas a meteorological drought creates stress on plant life unconnected with people and their needs. Sometimes agricultural drought defined in terms of soil moisture deficit and state that it occurs when there is a consistently high soil moisture deficit over the growing season.\nIn human terms, agricultural drought is a moisture deficit on a sufficient scale to cause \ndisruption of the rural economy. In an extreme agricultural drought, crops fail, and animals and perhaps people die. A shifting drought threshold shows how changes in population pressure and crop rotation may affect the drought threshold. Thus, agricultural drought is analyzed as a substitution of maize, a more water demanding cash crop than millet, a traditional dry area crop that affect the Kenyan landscape.\n7 .3.4. Ratio and Indices Drought \nA number of different indices have been developed to quantify a drought, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Most commonly used indices are:  \n Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) \n Crop Moisture Index (CMI) \n Satellite Vegetative Health Index (VHI) \n Percentile of Normal precipitation\n Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) \nPalmer Drought Severity Index: The PDSI was the first index developed in the United .States. (1965).\nIt is a soil moisture algorithm based on precipitation and temperature data, as well as the local \navailable water content of the soil. From the inputs, all the basic terms of the water balance equation can be determined. Negative values depict drought (range –6 to 6).  \n6 Strengths: it is very comprehensive, it places current conditions in an historical perspective, and it is best for long-term drought and homogeneous area. \n6 Limitations: it can be slow to respond, it does not consider snowpack, and there is a need to know the state of the climate."

A Vegetation and Temperature condition Index (VT) is produced, with values from 0 to 100 characterizing change in vegetation conditions from extremely poor (0) to excellent (100). \n Strengths: it provides good spatial coverage of vegetative health for agricultural applications; it is useful for early drought detection; it is not adversely affected by bad surface observations. \n Limitations: It is useful only during the growing season.\nPercent of Normal Precipitation: it is calculated as;\nPNP=(Actual precipitation )/(Normal precipitation) x 100\n Strengths: it is very easy to calculate, regularly generated by various climate software \npackages, and is generally useful and easy to be understood by media and public. \n Limitations: it is often misunderstood as precipitation has a non-normal distribution, which is not taken into account.

Causes of Drought\nDroughts are primarily caused by changing weather patterns, which manifest as an excessive accumulation of heat on the earth's surface, as well as meteorological changes that result in less rainfall and lower cloud cover, all of which result in higher evaporation rates. Basically, droughts in Africa are caused by a combination of natural and human factors. \nThe most important natural factor responsible for the prevalence of drought is El Nino and \nLa Nina effect. In Africa it occurs most frequently during the warm El Nino period. In fact, this does not happen always as there are many other local and global factors influencing the drought phenomenon. In Southern and Eastern Africa regions, droughts have occurred during cold La Nina time. In some cases, a powerful La Nina event was the primary cause of the drought in the Horn of Africa in 2010–201 1.\nThe recent severe droughts in Sahel region were caused by the ocean warming (southward \nwarming gradient of the Atlantic ocean and steady warming of the Indian Ocean), southward shift of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

Anthropogenic contribution in land use change altering the land surface feedback mechanisms is also seen as a factor. Furthermore, human induced greenhouse gas emission is also considered as a contributory factor to oceans warming.  Although it is generally true that lower rainfall results in lower crop yields, the following factors have an impact on the strength of the connection and on the severity of drought in many African nations: \nÞ The proportion of production which is irrigated;\nÞ The moisture retention capacity of the soil;\nÞ Timeliness of the rainfall (the normal growing season rainfall occurring during the cycle);\nÞ The adaptive behavior of farmers; and\nÞ a standard operational definition of drought.\n7 .3.6. The Impact of DroughtsOf all the natural hazards, droughts are potentially those having the greatest economic impact and affecting the greatest number of people. Earthquakes and cyclones may be of enormous physical intensity but are invariably of short duration, and are geographically limited. By contrast droughts affect large geographical areas, often covering whole countries or parts of continents and may last for several months and, in some cases, several years. Of the main natural disasters, droughts are unique in terms of the length of time between the first indications from, for example, rainfall monitoring, that a drought is developing and the point at which it begins to impact significantly upon the population of the affected area. Droughts, almost or virtually always, have a direct and significant impact on food production and the overall economy. The impact on a particular population is related to the severity and nature of the drought, but equally, and occasionally more importantly, to the nature of the economy and society in the affected area.\nFirst, consider an extreme example. Two semi-arid countries experience a 50% reduction in \nannual rainfall. Country X is a high income economy where agriculture contributes only 10% of the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and water for industry, agriculture and domestic use is drawn from reliable underground aquifers. Country Y is a low income economy where agriculture is primarily rainfed and contributes 50% of total GDP."

The scenario becomes more interesting if the assumption about the reliability of the underground aquifers in Country X is altered so that water is drawn from rivers and reservoirs whose catchment area is affected by the reduction in rainfall – a hydrological drought. Likely impacts include reduced agricultural and industrial production, increased unemployment, domestic water rationing, increased cost of living, and increased investment in the exploitation of alternative water resources, and so on.\nBearing in mind the variations between economies and societies noted above, the following \nlist of potential economic and social impacts of an agricultural drought may be helpful.

It affects as many as a one-third of the world’s population and causes the premature death of many among the world’s poor. The following is the safest method of defining famine. Famine results from a sequence of processes and events that reduce food availability or food entitlements causing widespread and substantially increased morbidity and mortality.\nOver the last two decades, the concept of food security has emerged as a definitional scheme \nthat considers the relationships between food production, distribution and consumption. It is now widely used by governments and donor agencies, and it is helpful to locate famine within this framework. The most widely used definition of food security is that outlined by the World Bank (1986): Food security is access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life. Its essential elements are the availability of food and the ability to acquire it. Food insecurity, in turn, is the lack of access to enough food. There are two kinds of food insecurity: chronic and transitory.Chronic food insecurity is a continuously inadequate diet caused by a household’s persistent lack of ability to buy or to produce enough food.Transitory food insecurity is a temporary decline in a household’s access to enough food. It often results from instability in food prices, declining food production or household incomes – and in its worst form produces famine.\n7 .4.2. Incidence of Famine\nFamines have occurred periodically in most, if not all, societies throughout history. Chronicles of ancient civilizations in India, Egypt, Western Asia, China, Greece and Rome record famines in these and other parts of the world. In the Middle Ages, famine was a frequent occurrence in Europe. For example, historians estimate that during the 900 year period from the 10th C to the 18th, there were 89 “general” famines in France and hundreds more “local” famines. Since then famines in Western Europe have become markedly less frequent as a result of agricultural innovation and the Industrial Revolution, though the 1846-5 1 “Great Famine” that occurred in Ireland was possibly one of the most catastrophic.\nThe most recent “famine” to occur in Western Europe developed in the Netherlands during \nthe winter of 1944 when a military stalemate between the advancing Allied Forces and the retreating German Army created severe food shortages in the main urban areas and significantly increased mortality."

Causes of Famine\nFamines are caused by either or both of the following factors:\n6 A decline in food availability; and\n6 A reduction in people’s access to, or their ability to acquire, food.\nDeclines in food availability may be caused by a range of “natural” and human-induced factors.

Desertification received a lot of attention in the 1970s as a result of the consequences of a long term drought in Western African Sahel. As a result of the United Nations Conference on Deforestation, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification was formed. As to eastern African desertification condition, the dryland of the region is representing about 65% of the total area of the region that is highly vulnerable to desertification. Rapid population growth, widespread deforestation and the construction of large-scale projects cause land degradation in this arid and semiarid area of eastern Africa. Various attempts were made to combat desertification by promoting afforestation programs.\nDrought is the absence of regular rainfall over an extended period of time. There are five dry \nlands identified in the world. These include Sonoran desert, Atacama, the vast diagonal area extending from Atlantic to China, Namib-Kalhari, and most Australian area. Three different types of drought are identified: these are metrological, hydrological and agricultural. These category are usually but incorrectly viewed as synonymous terms though they are essentially different. There are different types of ratio or indices of droughtness. The most commonly used are: palmer drought severity index, crop moisture index, satellite vegetative health index and standard precipitation index. The major causes of drought are categorized as natural and manmade. El Nino, La Nina and warming ocean that affects the shift of Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) are taken as natural. Also, land cover change, greenhouse gas emission are some of the manmade factors. Drought affects large geographic area. It always has a direct and significant impact on food production and the overall economy. \nFamine is not a single easily identifiable phenomenon, it is rather a process that is difficult \nto differentiate from critical hunger. A more precise definition of famine is that it is the result of a process reducing food availability or food entitlements, and causes widespread and substantially increased morbidity and mortality. Famine is mainly caused by either or both of a decline in food availability and a reduction in people’s access to or their ability to acquire food. To maintain food security, it is necessary to take measures in protecting people’s access to food through ensuring the availability of food in the affected areas, and protecting the entitlements of groups with the affected population."

The newest skill and technology of map making or GIS also helps to locate their place and navigate some routes in their research project. This unit will, thus, enable learners to develop the abilities and attitudes pertaining to basic research method so that they become the future researchers in the field. Furthermore, it introduces students to one of the 21\nst century skills and technology of map making that we \nrefer to as GIS and remote sensing.\n8.1.

As sometimes good researches don't always reach their intended audience, it's critical to make researches accessible to the appropriate institutions, among other things, so that they may be used to take action.Therefore, one could define research as a scientific method of seeking a solution for the \nproblems identified. It is basically a systematic inquiry into causes or the discovery of new facts through planned and organized effort that requires time, money and skill. Generally, research is the search for knowledge through objective and systematic methods of finding solutions to problems.\nFigure 8.1.

The techniques that geographers use in their work are not developed in a vacuum. They are developed to address specific problems and, thus, reflect the focus of the discipline at particular times. These techniques reflect the conscious decisions of geographers about the kinds of information that are important to collect; the spatial scales at which information should be collected, compiled, analyzed, and displayed; data sampling strategies and experimental designs; data representation; and methods for data analysis. The methodologies for empirical research vary as theoretical perspectives shift.

For instance, in your study, you may start with some exploratory   investigations to determine which variables or factors are important. Next, you might try to   describe the phenomena and how they are related. You may follow this by seeking to explain what caused the phenomena, and to make a prediction about future outcomes.for example, if we were interested to investigate why people migrate to a new and relatively unknown area, the four approaches could be linked in the following way:\n Explore why people might want to relocate from their current location to a new one,  \n Describe the patterns of migration based upon the factors found during exploration,\n Explain the patterns of migration identified when describing the exploratory factors, and\n •predict possible future migrations based upon the explanations of current \nAny research project has the following three components:\n A subject matter (what is being studied?),\n Methodology or Approach (how it is being studied), and\n Philosophical bases (ontology, epistemology...).\nThe whole procedure of your research job is determined by your geographic knowledge. Geography is one of the few subjects that may easily link the social sciences, biophysical sciences, and humanities. Though various definitions exist, Geography can be regarded as a science concerned with the rational development, and testing of theories that attempt to explain and predict the spatial distribution and location of various characteristics on the surface of the earth. For geographers, research is the process of trying to gain a better understanding of the relationships between humans, space, place and environment which leads them use scientific methods. \nGeography has a long history of research that spans to 2000 years. It  has always welcomed \nnew technology, research methodologies, teaching methods, skills, and material as a scientific subject. The scope and technique of geography have developed over time as a result of technological advancements and the accumulation of knowledge. Traditionally, geographical research is related to the locations of places and people. In the eighteenth century, geography’s focus shifted to the physical and human characteristics of places in our world. In the mid-twentieth century, geographical research focused mainly on: \n¿ The spatial distributions of phenomena and things, \n¿ The resulting patterns and interactions, and\n¿ The forces responsible for the formation of the patterns."

Basically, research approaches are classified as quantitative and qualitative. Some literature may add a third alternative called mixed research approach. The following subsections discuss these three different approaches. \nQuantitative approach \nQuantitative research includes designs, techniques and measures that produce discrete numerical or quantifiable data, and data analysis is mainly statistical (deductive process). That means, we use the quantitative approach when trying to verify a given geographical theory. We translate the concepts of the theory into variables that can be measured with statistical techniques. The benefit of this method is that the quantitative technique used by one researcher may be utilized by another researcher for other purposes or to expand on the same data.  \nFigure 8.3 quantitative data representation are more of numeric \nExamples of issues that show the application of this approach have been given as follows: \n Temperature decreases as one travels from lowland to highland areas; \n Land value increases as one moves from city periphery to the city center.\nThese examples basically discover the difference in variables that occur as a function of altitude and distance measured from a designated place for example, from lowland to highland and from periphery to the city core."

It involves extensive descriptive data in order to gain insights into phenomena. Data analysis includes the coding of the data and production of verbal synthesis (inductive process). This method does not examine any already held theories or hypotheses. There are no quantitative approaches used. As a result, other researchers will be unable to replicate the findings. Data are utilized to explain a new hypothesis in the qualitative method. Some of the major types of qualitative research approaches include the following: \n6 Historical/Narrative research, \n6 Ethnographic research,\n6 Case study, \n6 Action research.\nMixed Methods ResearchIn the actual world, the data types that our study deals with are interlinked and difficult to separate. There are also a number of social and environmental issues, all of which are complexly interrelated. Therefore, the third research strategy is being developed in modern research activities. That is a mixed research approach. Mixed methods research is research in which quantitative and qualitative techniques are mixed in a single study. It is the third major research paradigm/perspective, adding an alternative (when it is appropriate) to quantitative and qualitative research approaches. According to proponents of the method, the following two elements should be considered while using the mixed research approach. \n6 The issue of harmony and the idea of how quantitative and qualitative methods are interrelated to use both in a single research.\n6 Flexible outlook that researchers should use the approach or mixture of approaches that works the best in a real world situation."

Research method and methodology\nThe terms research method and research methodology are interchangeable, although they have difference in terms of scope. A research work is mostly an investigation of a problem. The researcher's motivation might stem from his or her curiosity as well as a clear objective to solve the challenge. However, the use of research results as a guide is required in many business, social, intellectual, and other issues.\nResearch methods fundamentally include all those techniques/methods that are adopted for \nconducting research. Some of the main methods incorporated in the research works are: \n6 The collection and organization of data necessary or related to the problem, \n6 The use of statistical parameters to treat and interpret the organized data, and\n6 The evaluation of the accuracy of the result obtained.\nResearch methodology, on the other hand, refers to a way of systematically solving the research problem. It is a science of studying how research is conducted scientifically. Thus, the concept of research methodology is much broader than the method and it considers: \nÞ Why the study is undertaken (its significance at various levels); \nÞ How the research problem is identified;\nÞ What assumptions or hypotheses are formulated; \nÞ What type of data are collected; and\nÞ Why a particular method or technique of analyzing the data is chosen.  \nIn short, research methodology has wider dimensions than research method or technique.

The what, where, when, how much, and by what means of your research project and its subject are answered by a research design. \nDetermining the sample\nConducting a study on the entire population is tough, and our project may be too vast to be feasible. The population refers to the total group of people with whom the study will be conducted. Sometimes, the entire population will be sufficiently small, and the researcher can include the entire population in the study. This type of research is called a census study. Usually, the population is too large for the researchers to attempt to survey all of its members. A small, but carefully chosen sample can be used to represent the population. The sample reflects the characteristics of the population from which it is drawn. Sampling methods are classified as either probability or non-probability.Literature Review\nThe purpose of the literature review is to situate your research in the context of what is al -\nready known about a topic. It need not be exhaustive, it needs to show how your work will benefit the whole. It should provide the theoretical basis for your work, show what has been done in the area by others, and set the stage for your work. It should probably move from the more general to the more focused studies;it need not be exhaustive, but has to be relevant. Sometimes the literature review is incorporated into the introduction section. However, most scholars prefer a separate section, which allows a more thorough review of the literature. The literature review serves several important functions, for instance, it:\n Ensures that you are not \"reinventing the wheel\". \n Gives credits to those who have laid the groundwork for your research. \n Demonstrates your knowledge of the research problem. \n Demonstrates your understanding of the theoretical and research issues related to your research question. \n Shows your ability to critically evaluate relevant literature information. \n Indicates your ability to integrate and synthesize the existing literature. \n Provides new theoretical insights or develops a new model as the conceptual framework for your research."

Probability methods include random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling and clustered sampling.\nNon probability sampling: Here members are selected from the population in some non-\nprobability manner. These include convenience sampling, judgment sampling, quota sampling and snow ball sampling.\nData Collection\nData collection is a time-consuming and costly part of the research process. There are two basic sources of data, these are primary and secondary source. Primary Data source: A primary data source is an original data source, that is, one in which the data are collected firsthand by the researcher for a specific research purpose or project. This type of data collection is original in character. The research produces the data, rather than relying on existing data. There are several ways of collecting primary data.\n Experimental data,\n Survey questionnaires, \n Interview,\n Personal observations,\n Focus group discussions, \n Satellite imageries, metrological data.  \nSecondary data source: Secondary data is data which has been collected by individuals or agencies for purposes other than those of our particular research study. For example, if a government department has conducted a survey of, say, family food expenditures, and then a food manufacturer might use this data in the organization’s evaluations of the total potential market for a new product. Similarly, statistics prepared by a ministry on agricultural production will prove useful to a whole host of people and organizations, including those marketing agricultural supplies.

For quantitative data analysis, issues of validity and reliability are important. Thus, the researcher must make sure that their measurements are stable and consistent and that there are no errors or bias present. For quantitative data, the analysis can be left until the end of the data collection process.\nFor qualitative data, the researcher might analyze as the research progresses, continually \nrefining and reorganizing in light of the emerging results.

GIS is a tool for capturing, storing, manipulating, analyzing, managing, and presenting various forms of geographic data. This technology's essential term is geography, which indicates that the main part of the data is spatial. That is to say, the information used in it is linked to a specific location.\nJust as we use a word processor to write documents and deal with words on a computer, we \ncan use a GIS application to deal with spatial information on a computer. As indicated above the acronym GIS stands for 'Geographical Information System'. It consists of the following basic elements:\n Digital Data – the geographical information that you will view and analyze using computer hardware and software.\n Computer Hardware – computers used for storing data, displaying graphics and processing data.\n Computer Software – computer programs that run on the computer hardware and allow you to work with digital data. A software program that forms part of the GIS is called a GIS Application.\nWith a GIS application you can open digital maps on your computer, create new spatial information to add to a map, create printed maps customized to your needs and perform spatial analysis.\nAs the continuation of your previous grade lessons, the following sections discuss the GIS \ndata type and use, and the method of data analysis. \n1. Can you recall the definitions of geospatial information or GIS you learned in previous grades?\nCase study Let's look at a simple example as to how GIS \ncan be useful.

Data is one of the most essential aspects of it. GIS data is basically a spatial data that can be mapped. Spatial data can be obtained from various sources. It might be data obtained directly from the ground or data gathered by others for their own purposes. The first segment may include field survey data and remote sensing photos. The second part includes paper maps and current digital data sets. Therefore, GIS data may be categorized into primary and secondary type, as we saw in the research method section.\na. Data generalization\nTo collect, symbolize and represent, the GIS data has to pass through the process of abstraction or generalization. Two key factors must be addressed while collecting, representing, and symbolizing GIS data. These are selecting the level of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio) and choosing the dimensionalities of the features (point, line, area, volume). \nLevel of measurement \nIn nominal measurement, the numerical values just “name” the attribute uniquely with no ordering of the cases implied. For example, jersey numbers in basketball are measures at the nominal level. A player with number 30 is not more of anything than a player with number 15, and is certainly not twice whatever number 15 is.In ordinal measurement the attributes can be rank-ordered. Here, distances between attributes do not have any meaning. 8.2.1. Gathering Data for GISAt the end of this section, you will be able to:\n identify the major source of GIS data; \n explain the different ways of data representation and its effect on map interpre -\ntation; and\n construct statistical diagrams using data from various sources. \nKEY TERMS: spatial data, map data generalization, measurement scale, \n                      Map data dimensionality.  \n1.

In this measure, higher numbers mean more education. But is the distance from 0 to 1 the same as 3 to 4? Of course not. The interval between values is not interpretable in an ordinal measure.\nIn interval measurement the distance between attributes does have meaning. For example, \nwhen we measure temperature (in Fahrenheit), the distance from 30-40 is the same as the distance from 70-80. The interval between the values is interpretable. Because of this, it makes sense to compute an average of an interval variable, whereas it does not make any sense to do so for ordinal scales. But note that in interval measurement ratios do not make any sense 80 \n0c is not twice as hot as 400c (although the attribute value is twice larger).\nFinally, in ratio measurement there is always an absolute zero that is meaningful. This means that you can construct a meaningful fraction (or ratio) with a ratio variable. \nWeight is a ratio variable. In applied social research most “count” variables are ratio, for \nexample, the number of clients in the past six months. Why? Because you can have zero clients and because it is meaningful to say that “…we had twice as many clients in the past six months as we did in the previous six months.”\nFeatures of dimensionality \nMapping Features Conceived as a Point: Many mapped phenomena exist at points, are referenced to as points in reality, or conceived as points for mapping purposes. Such a feature has a locational attribute (X, Y coordinate) that specifies its position on the earth. It might be measured in both quantitative and qualitative ways.\nMapping Feature Conceived as Line: Symbols portraying attributes of features conceived as \nlines are easy to find on the maps. Examples of these symbols include coast line, rivers, administrative boundaries, roads, rail ways and flow and movements between locations. Line features also represent qualitative and quantitative information/data."

Why do we need to generalize data? It is helpful to distinguish between important and unimportant phenomena or events, and enhance map communication. Thus, each selected feature and its attributes should contribute to the effective communication of information. Some the major elements of data generalization in map making are stated below:\nClassification – ordering, scaling and grouping features by their attributes and attribute \nvalues.Simplification- determining important characteristics of the feature attributes, and eliminates unwanted details. Exaggeration – enhancing or emphasizing important characteristics of the attributes.Symbolization- the graphic coding of information and thereby placing it into a map context\nb. Data representation \nProper representation of data is an important requirement in GIS work. In a GIS environment, there are four basic ways of representation of data in a choropleth maps that all look different. Map readers may likely draw different conclusions from those maps. In those maps data values, which are given below, are grouped into five classes using different data classification methods. You can compare data classification methods by referring to a histogram and noting where classes are divided in the histogram.\nThe natural break / Jenk’s method divides data into the most homogeneous five classes. Notice \nthat the fifth class (53950–105350) in the natural break map, is internally homogeneous, and is distinct from the other classes."

This can help to create \nmeaningful sequence and show new relationships within or between data sets. Thus, it increases understanding of real world. This is done by integrating data from many sources and analyzing multi-parameter data to offer answers and solutions to a given problem. Spatial analysis is the vital part of GIS. Its operation can be grouped into two, the first one deals with no new data generation that includes Attribute Query and Spatial Query or generally called querying. The second one is concerned with generating a new data including proximity or buffering, overlay and network analysis.\na. Querying \nAttribute Query: It’s a process of selecting information by asking logical questions. Example: From a database of a city parcel map where every parcel is listed with a land use code, a simple attribute query may require the identification of all parcels for a specific land use type. Such a query can be handled through the table without referencing the parcel map. Because no spatial information is required to answer this question, the query is considered an attribute query. In this example, the entries in the attribute table that have land use codes identical to the specified type are identified. \nSpatial Query: Involves selecting features based on the location or spatial relationships, which \nrequires processing of spatial information. For instance, a question may be raised about parcels within one mile of the freeway and each parcel. In this case, the answer can be obtained either from a hardcopy map or by using a GIS with the required geographic information."

Analysis to generate new data\nStudents, let us take this spatial analysis concept a step further. \n¿ Have you ever tried to figure out how to go from your house to your school in the least amount of time?\n¿ Have you ever had trouble getting to the nearest health facility from your home? \n¿ Assume your family has an ice cream parlor, a fruit market, a bakery, and so on. \nHas your family had difficulties in obtaining a new branch business center?GIS has a method to tackle these your problems.  \nProximity analysis \nProximity analysis is an important function in GIS as it covers a wide range of topics that help in answering many spatial issues. One of the most basic questions asked of a GIS is “what is near to what?” Proximity tools can be divided into two categories depending on the type of input the tool accepts, namely, features or raster. Therefore, there are two forms of proximity analysis:. feature/ vector based proximity analysis and raster based proximity analysis. \nFeature (vector) based proximity analysis: For feature data, the tools found in the Proximity \ntoolset can be used to discover proximity relationships. Buffers are usually used to delineate protected zones around features or to show areas of influence. For example, you might buffer a school by one Kilometer and use the buffer to select all the students that live more than one Kilometer from the school to plan for their transportation to and from the school. You could use the multi-ring buffer tool to classify the areas around a feature into near, moderate distance, and long distance classes for an analysis. Buffers are sometimes used to extract data to a given study area or to exclude features within a critical distance of something from further consideration in an analysis. You might use Near tool to find the closest stream for a set of wildlife observations or the closest bus stops to a set of tourist destinations. The tool will also add the Feature Identifier and, optionally, coordinates and the angle toward the nearest feature."

Distance tools can also calculate the shortest path across a surface or the corridor between two locations that minimizes two sets of costs. Distance surfaces are often used as inputs for overlay analyses. For example, in a model of habitat suitability, distance from streams could be an important factor for water-loving animals. You might use Euclidean Distance as part of a forest fire model, where the probability of a given cell igniting is a function of distance from a currently burning cell.\nEuclidean distance is straight-line distance for a given set of input features, the minimum \ndistance to a feature is calculated for every cell.

It is arguably the most powerful function of a GIS. Any mapped area of the earth’s surface can be subdivided (classified) into any number of different thematic “layers”. Thus, a typical map will conventionally show rail lines, the road network, forested areas, urban areas, the river network, the coastline, etc., and each of these themes can be mapped separately. Based on the input data used in the process, there are two kinds of overly analysis. These are raster and vector overlay. \nVector Overlays: The first type of overly operations we are going to discuss in this subsection is \nvector overlay. A vector overlay involves combining point, line, or polygon geometry and their associated attributes. All overly operations create new geometry and a new output geospatial data set. You should be cautioned that with certain overly operations, very large attribute tables may result if the overly operations combine many layers, and each layer has a very large attribute table. Additionally, it might be possible that the combined attribute tables would cause duplicate attribute fields to exist. In these cases, you should consider reducing the number of transferred attributes to the minimum required, and renaming duplicate fields so that there is no ambiguity. The vector overlay has also three functions. These are clip, intersect and union.\n 8.15. Union vector overlay function and output"

Just like with vectors, we can \nperform overlay analysis with raster sets using a different series of tools. As vector tools only work with vector layers, raster tools only works with raster layers, and with the exception of a vector layer designating an extent in some raster tools, there are no tools which combine vector and raster data sets for geoprocessing.  By “overlaying” one raster over another, we can examine the cell values from one raster to another and find relationships.\nA faster way of performing an overlay is to use raster data. If both raster layers are of the \nsame resolution and their pixels are aligned, then an overlay operation is merely matching corresponding pixels from both layers and combining their attributes to form a new pixel in the composite layer.\nThis involves no geometrical calculations and no creation of new polygons. Unless the layers \nare extremely large, overlay analysis involving raster layers can be done interactively. To process the raster overlay analysis, we may utilize a variety of functions. In general, we utilize spatial analysis, overlay tools for one thing, and map algebra for the other.\n8.16.
