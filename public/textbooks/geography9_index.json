If not, why?\nThe term ‚ÄúGeography‚Äù first appeared in history at the time when the Greek \ncivilization reached its peak. They defined geography for the first time by combining two words of Greek origin namely: Geo and Graphos.\n‚Üí Geo ‚Äì which means earth\n‚Üí Graphos ‚Äì which means writing\nEratosthenes, a famous Greek Philosopher (276-194 B.C) coined the term \nGeography and defined it as ‚Äúthe field of study that deals with the description of the earth‚Äù. Now this definition seems very general when we compare it to the scope of current geography. \nA number of definitions have been given by different scholars of the nineteenth \nand twentieth centuries. These definitions relate to geography‚Äôs current concerns, interests and focus.\nHere are some of the most important definitions that scholars have proposed:\n √û Eratosthenes (276-196 BC) ‚Äì Geography is the description of the \nearth.\n √û Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859) - Geography is a \nsynthesizing discipline to connect the general with the particular \nthrough measurement, mapping, and a regional emphasis.\n √û Concise Oxford Dictionary (1964) - Geography is the science of the earth‚Äôs surfaces.\n √û Hartshorne, R. (1899-1992) ‚Äì Geography is a branch of knowledge that is concerned with the provision of an accurate, orderly and rational description of distributions on the surface of the earth.\n √û Yeates, M. (1968) ‚Äì Geography is a science that is concerned with the rational development and testing of theories that explain and predict the spatial distribution and locations of things and phenomena on the surface of the earth.\nAs you have read above, each of these definitions includes the idea that geography \nstudies the earth.  Most of them specify the surface of the earth ."

However, the following may be widely accepted definitions by most scholars. \nGeography is the scientific study of the Earth that describes and analyses \nspatial and temporal variations of physical, biological and human phenomena, and their interrelationships and dynamism over the surface of the Earth.\n1.1.2  The Scope of Geography\nWhat does the word scope mean? What is the scope of geography? \nScope refers to the content (how broad or narrow) of the field of study of a given \ndiscipline, in this case geography. The scope of Geography is very wide. As the scope is dynamic, it often changes as discoveries and ideas enter the field. \nGeography studies a great many physical and human features of the world. Its \nfocus includes their causes, effects, and interactions. As a result, the subjects that geography examines include features in the hydrosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere, biosphere and anthroposphere.\nGeography as a field of study is also concerned with the economic, social, political \nand ecological problems that you hear every day. It is also concerned with modern technology, such as computers, Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) to analyze information and draw conclusion with accuracy.\n NOTE\n √ûHydrosphere ‚Äì it includes all the bodies of water, i.e., oceans, rivers, lakes and \nothers. \n √ûBiosphere ‚Äì refers to all living organisms in and on the earth‚Äôs surface.\n √ûAtmosphere ‚Äì it includes all aspects of air composition surrounding our planet.\n √ûLithosphere ‚Äì it is the solid layer of rocks that covers the entire surface of the planet.\n √ûAnthroposphere ‚Äì it is the part of the environment that is made or modified by \nhumans."

Do you \nunderstand the extent of its scope?\nIt is true that geography has a very wide scope. However, this does not mean its \nscope is limitless.  The major areas that geography focuses on are: \n √ûthe earth, its position in the universe and its movements; \n √ûthe different physical features that constitute the earth‚Äôs surface, the forces \nthat cause them, their variations from place to place and their changes over time; \n √ûthe different relationships between human beings and their natural environment. Also, the interdependence and the impact that each has on the other; \n √ûthe conditions of the lower part of the atmosphere and the subsequent weather and climatic conditions, together with their spatial distribution and variation; \n √ûthe materials that make up the earth and its diverse landforms; and \n √ûthe major economic activities of humans and the impacts on the environment. \nTherefore, geography deals with an enormous range of phenomena ranging from \nphysical and biotic to human environment. It is possible to conclude that although wide in its scope, geography has certain areas that it focuses upon. Hence, geography is a holistic discipline of knowledge and research (academics).\n1.1.3  Branches of Geography\nWhat are the two branches of geography?

Its shape is considered to be compact or essentially circular because the extreme north-south and east-west spans of the country cover comparable distances. You can easily see this approximate circularity in your school atlases and wall maps.\nThere are three theoretical indicators of the compactness of an area:\n √ûthe boundary - circumference ratio (B/C);\n √ûthe area - boundary ratio (A/B); and\n √ûthe actual area - area of the inscribing circle (A/A‚Äô).\n NOTE\nEach of these theoretical assumptions is based on a value of 1 as indicating a perfectly \ncompact shape except A/B ratio. They consider 0.5 ‚Äì1.5 values as deviating only slightly from circular/compact and therefore indicating approximate compactness. In contrast, smaller values indicate greater divergence from compactness, especially as they approach zero (0). These small values reflect tendencies to elongation or truncation. On the other hand, A/B ratio compares the total area of a country under consideration with the total boundary length of the same country. The larger the areal size per unit boundary length is, the more compact the country is.\nFor example, let‚Äôs use the boundary-circumference ratio to measure Ethiopia‚Äôs degree of compactness or index of compactness. In the ratio, circumference is based on the assumption of a circle having equal area with the country under consideration.\nThe formula to find the circumference of a circle having equal areal size as the country under consideration is 2œÄr (œÄ=3.14 ). The value of radius (r) is not given, and it should be computed. It is going to be calculated taking an area of a circle that is assumed to have equal areal size as the country under consideration.. Thus, area of the circle is calculated taking the following formula (i.e. A=œÄr\n2)."

No significant structural formation took \nplace. Hence, the Paleozoic is the only era that left a gap in a rock formation in Ethiopia. The massive denudational activity resulted in the formation of inselbergs (residual features) in some parts of Ethiopia.\n NOTE\nThe Paleozoic era is known for the predominance of invertebrates.\nIII. The Mesozoic Era (from 250 million years to 70 million years \nago)\nWhich life form was dominant in the Mesozoic era?\nThis era was marked by alternate slow sinking and uplifting of the landmass (Epeirogenesis) of the Horn of Africa. The Mesozoic Era was an era of sedimentary rock formation in Ethiopia. The Mesozoic era has three distinct periods as indicated hereunder.\nTable 1.3 The Three Periods of Mesozoic Era\nPeriods Geological time scale\nTriassic 250 - 180 millions\nJurassic 180 - 135 millions\nCretaceous 135 - 70 millions\nTriassic Period\nDuring this Period, the landmass sank due to internal forces. This event was \nfollowed by transgression of a nearby sea into the mainland of today‚Äôs Somalia and southeastern Ethiopia. During the Triassic Period, the oldest sedimentary rock known as Adigrat sandstone was formed. The Adigrat sandstone is the oldest in the \nsoutheast and progressively decreases in age to the northwest."

The sedimentary rocks formed in the Mesozoic Era were later buried by overlying Cenozoic igneous rocks. However, the sedimentary rocks have been exposed at the surface in some areas of Ethiopia. They are thinnest (because they are the youngest) in the southeast and thickest (because they are the oldest) in the northwest. \nOne can see them exposed at the surface mostly in the southeastern lowlands \nof Ethiopia, central Tigray, and in the Abbay and Wabishebelle gorges.

During this era very significant structural, \nclimatic and biological events have occurred in Ethiopia. Thus, geologic events of \nthe Cenozoic era have greatly resulted in the development of very recent landforms in the Horn of Africa in general and Ethiopia in particular. \nThe Cenozoic Era is divided into two periods namely, Tertiary and Quaternary.  To \nmake this lesson simple and comprehendible, we shall discuss only the geological events of this era into events of each of the Periods.\na. Geologic Events of the Tertiary Period - (70 million - 2 million years ago)\nIn the Tertiary Period, the uplifting that began in the Cretaceous Period of the \nMesozoic Era continued and reached its maximum height. In Ethiopia and the Horn \nit formed huge blocks of dome over the greater part of the region. As the uplifting continued through time, great cracks opened in the crust and resulted in the pouring out of extensive basaltic lava (known as the Trappean lava series). \nThe lava resulted in the formation of:\n √ûthe Northwestern Highlands,\n √ûthe Southeastern Highlands, and\n √ûthe Somali plateaus.\nAs the cracking and faulting continued during the period, it formed the Great East African Rift Valley System ‚Äì of which the Ethiopian Rift Valley System is part. The Great East African Rift system extends from Palestine-Jordan in the north to Malawi-Mozambique in the south, for a distance of about 7,200 kilometers. Of these, 5,600 kilometers is in Africa, and 1,700 kilometers in Eritrea and Ethiopia.\nb.

The same cycle of season is repeated year after year. \n2.4.2.1 Seasonal Variation of Temperature in Ethiopia\nCan you identify the temperature differences in Ethiopia between the \nmonths of April/May and those of October/November? How do these differences occur?\nIn Ethiopia, temperatures vary from season to season. For example, in most parts \nof Ethiopia, high temperatures are recorded from March to June. Conversely, low temperatures are recorded from November to February.  These variations are primarily due to:\n √ûthe tilting of the earth at 23¬Ω¬∫ to the normal elliptic, and \n √ûthe distance of the overhead sun and its apparent north-south movement \nacross the equator as the earth revolves around the sun.\nDuring the winter season of the northern hemisphere, Ethiopia experiences the \n‚ÄúBega‚Äù season. During this season, day have clear skies. Thus, the incoming solar rays are intense. As a result temperature increases in day time and abruptly decreases at night because of clear sky. This, therefore, results in high diurnal range of temperature. \n √ûThe mean maximum temperatures are experienced over the western, \nnorth eastern and south eastern lowlands while the lowest temperatures are over the Semein and Arsi-Bale mountains.\n √ûThe highest temperature i.e. over 45oC is recorded in the Danakil \nDepression - the hottest place of Ethiopia.\n2.4.2.2 Seasonal Variation of Rainfall in Ethiopia\nDo you distinguish the two concepts spatial and temporal?

During this time, Ethiopia comesunder \nthe influence of the Equatorial Westerlies and Easterlies. As they originate from water bodies, these winds bring moisture to the highlands, but decrease their magnitude and length of rainy periods northwards.\nIn December, its position shifts to the Tropic of Capricorn leaving the region for \nthe prevalence of the Northeast Trade winds that are non-moisture-laden as they originate from the continental landmass.

The rain gauge is usually anchored in the \nground with the top of the gauge around 30cm above the ground surface to ensure that rain splash does not affect the results. The depth of the rain in millimeters can be read from the side of the container at least once a day (usually at 9:00a.m). A records is kept of the amount of rain (if any) which has fallen during the past 24 hours. At the end of a month the daily amount rainfall records are added together and this gives, of course, the total amount of rainfall for that month.\nMean monthly rainfall:it is calculated by adding all the amounts of rainfall on daily \nbasis for the month and dividing the sum by the number of days of the month.\nTotal annual rainfall: it is calculated by adding the amounts rainfall of the 12 months.\nMean annual rainfall: it is calculated by adding the annual amounts of rainfall for \n30-35 years and dividing the sum by the number of those years. \nFocus \nC. Measuring and Recording Air Pressure\nAir is made up of a number of mixed gases and has weight. It therefore exerts a pressure on the earth‚Äôs surface which varies from place to place and from time to time. This force that presses on the surface of any object can be fairly accurately measured. The instrument for measuring pressure is a barometer. The unit more commonly used for measuring pressure is called millibar and millimeter. At sea level, the mercury column is 1013.25 millibars, or 760 mm.Mean monthly temperature : is determined by adding together the daily averages \nand the dividing the number of days in a month.\nMean annual temperature: it is calculated by adding the mean monthly temperatures \nand dividing the sum by 12.\nAnnual range of temperature:  it is the difference between the temperatures of the \nhottest and coldest months."

They are found dispersed \non the plateaus and clustered in the Rift Valley.\nMost of the lakes are the result of structures that occurred during the Quaternary \nPeriod; i.e., they are not outcomes of climate. This fact is proved by the location of these lakes in the drier parts of the country. The natural lakes found in Ethiopia can be classified into highland and Rift Valley lakes.\nHighland Lakes: These lakes are situated on the plateaus, either as crater or \nwatershed lakes. These types of lakes resulted from different types of structural formations.\nA crater lake is formed after an explosive volcano breaks a mountain open, leaving \na deep mouth. The mouth is filled with water ‚Äì from either small streams or subterranean sources. The highland crater lakes in Ethiopia are Haik near Dessie and Hashenge near Korum . There are also crater lakes in different parts of Ethiopia. They include  many small but deeper lakes in and around Bishoftu, e.g. Bishoftu, Kuriftu, Babbo Gaya, and Arsedi. Wonchi and Dendi around Ambo, Ginchi and Wellisso and Ziquala are the other crater lakes.\nA watershed lake is formed when a sheet of lava dams up a shallow surface \ndepression. For example, Lake Tana was formed during the Quaternary Period, when a sheet of flowing lava dammed the shallow depression that had already been formed between the Gojjam and Gondar Massif.\nRift Valley Lakes:  Unlike the \nhighland lakes, the Rift Valley lakes are clustered. The Rift Valley lakes are formed in the depressions and basins caused by tectonic activities. They are found in a linear pattern along the floor of the Rift Valley (see Figure 3.2).\nFigure 3.2: Major Rift Valley \nLakes of Ethiopia"

This has made the rivers flow swiftly. Many bigger rivers drain towards neighboring countries. Because of this and the fact that Ethiopia possesses many rivers and lakes, it is known as the ‚ÄúWater Tower of East Africa‚Äù.\n üåçEthiopia has different types of soils. They are basically derived from volcanic, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. The major types of soil in Ethiopia are nithosols, vertisols, acrisols, cambisols, regosols, xerosols, yermisols, luvisols, fluvisols and lithosols. The volcanic soil, especially nithosol, is the most widely utilized soil. The country‚Äôs cereals, coffee, inset, etc. are grown on this soil type.\n üåçIn Ethiopia, the types of the natural vegetation of an area are highly correlated with altitude and rainfall.

The human population has been a matter of study for various academic disciplines such as geography, biology, sociology, medical science, history, etc.  In geography as well, there is a separate branch that studies about human population: Population Geography. It is concerned mainly with the spatial analysis of the human population. It focuses on population-space relationships. It also emphasizes the spatial aspects of human population and the interaction and interdependence between the human population and the physical environment.\nThe human population is given great emphasis and is studied by various disciplines \nincluding population geography. \nThe human population is studied for many reasons including the following. \n √ûIt is very dynamic as it demonstrates significant quantitative and \nqualitative changes over time and space.

In 2020, its population \nwas estimated to be 114.9 million (UN, 2021), which ranks 12th in the world, and \nthe current growth rate is about 2.6 percent. According to the 2007 Census, the \npopulation of Ethiopia was 73.8 million. The country‚Äôs population is among the fastest growing population in the world. It was estimated that, in 1900, Ethiopia had only 11.8 million persons. This number increased to about 13 million in 1920 and 23.5 million in 1960, as it is shown in (Table 4.1). The table shows the population of the country in 1960 was doubled in 1990. These values show that, during those decades, it took 60 years for the population to double its size. In contrast, since 1960, the time required for the population to double has been on the decline. This is because of a rapid rate of population growth. For instance, the population doubled in size between 1960 and 1990, indicating a doubling time of only 30 years. \nA historical profile of the growth rates of the Ethiopian population since 1900 shows \nthat the population increased by less than 1.0 percent until about 1920. After 1920, however, the rate of growth slightly increased; and then, by 1950, it went up to 2.0 percent. The slow rate of population growth before 1920 reflected the country‚Äôs high mortality rate. With worldwide efforts to control malaria and other diseases in the 1950s and later, the growth rate rose from year to year and reached 2.8 percent in 1980. Between 1980 and 1990, the growth rate of Ethiopian population was around 3.0 percent. Between 2010 and 2020, the growth rate of Ethiopia was around 2.6 percent.KEY TERMS"

Age Structure\nAge structure is the classification of a given population into different age groups of various features. This structure becomes clear after we group all of the people in that population by age. In other words, age structure is the pattern that results from the distribution of members of a population into different age categories. \nThe distribution of population by age is among the most fundamental demographic \ncharacteristics of human population and that of demographic statistics. It plays an important role in the development of any society. The economic and cultural life of society critically depends upon the age structure of the population.

In the broad age groups, age groups 0-14, 15-64 and 65+ are known, respectively, as young age (the young dependent population), working age (the economically active population) and old age (the elderly dependent population).\nPopulation Pyramid\nWhat is population pyramid?\nA Population pyramid is a very useful aid in examining the age and sex structure \nof a population. It is a graphic representation of the distribution of the population by age and sex. In the age pyramid, the vertical axis is divided in years (usually five year age group interval) from zero upwards and the horizontal axis shows the percentages of males and females within these groups. Percentages are calculated to both sexes separately or of the total population.\nIn countries where birth rates are high and death rates are also high, the population \npyramid has the form of a triangle. This pattern is typical of the population of developing countries like Ethiopia, in which many children are born, but few reach old age. In contrast, in the developed countries, with their lower birth rates and fewer people dying young, the population pyramid is more rectangular, narrowing only nears its top. In these countries, both birth and death rates decline with a result showing the number of people in each group at an equivalent state."

These pyramids become increasingly narrower towards the top, advancing through the age groups, showing that the percentage of the population becomes less and less in the upper age groups (65-69, 70-74, etc.). The high percentage for the young age group is the result of high birth rate and natural increase, while the small percentage of the old age group is the reflection of high mortality rate, which results in low life expectancy."

Sex Structure \nSex structure is one of the basic demographic characteristics of a population. Sex structure is very important for demographic analysis because it provides useful information about reproductive potential, human resources, and so on.Sex structure refers to the ratio of the male population to the female population at different age groups. It is usually expressed as number of males per 100 females in a population. A ratio greater than 100 shows a greater number ‚Äì called an excess ‚Äì of males than females. Sex ratios can affect marriage prospects, labour force participation, and other social and economic variables. \nThe formula for calculating a sex ratio is:\nAccording to the 1984 census result, the sex ratio for the population of Ethiopia was \n99.4. This means that there were about 99 males for every 100 females. The 1994 census result showed that it was 101.3 and in 2007 sex ratio was 101.9.

What factors do you think are responsible for such spatial variation in the distribution of people over land?\nThis extreme unevenness is the result of a number of factors operating in combination. \nThese factors can be grouped into two: physical and human.\nA. Physical Factors\nThe most significant physical factors affecting the distribution of population in \nEthiopia are the following. \n √ûClimate (mainly rainfall and temperature) \n √ûSoil fertility \n √û Natural water supply \n √ûRelief (slope and altitude) \n √ûVegetation cover\nIn Ethiopia, most of the physical factors are influenced by altitude. Therefore, altitude is the most crucial physical factor influencing patterns of population distribution and settlement in the country. Studies in climatology make it clear that rainfall increases while temperature decreases with an increase in altitude. Incidentally, this means that rainfall is very low and temperature is high in lowland areas, while rainfall is high and temperature is moderately low in the highlands. Since soil formation and vegetation growth are closely associated with adequate rainfall and moderate temperature, highlands tend to have better soils and vegetation cover . \nLowlands in Ethiopia are characterized by scarcity of rainfall, high temperature, and poor vegetation and soil conditions. In addition to these negative factors, the prevalence of tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever contributes to the sparse population distribution in such areas. \nFor reasons of tropical diseases, most of the valleys of the major rivers of Ethiopia \nare also characterized by sparse population concentration. The main exception to this is the Awash River Valley, where irrigation agriculture is practiced. This overall pattern differs from what can be seen in other parts of the world, where valleys of major rivers are zones of large concentrations of people. However, with improvements in agricultural and medical technology, Ethiopia‚Äôs lower major river valleys might, in the future, attract more people from the densely populated highland areas."

Human Factors\nCan you mention the major human factors that have influenced \npopulation distribution in Ethiopia?\nThe major human factors which have influenced population distribution in Ethiopia \nare the following. \n √ûTypes of economic activity \n √û Historical patterns of population movement\nTypes of Economic Activities The types of economic activity performed in an area strongly influence the carrying capacity of that land. Consequently, the carrying capacity influences the number of people that can inhabit a given area. Being a country of diverse environmental and cultural conditions, Ethiopia offers ample evidence of these relationships. \nThe arid and semi-arid lowland areas of Ethiopia are areas that are more suitable \nfor pastoralist activities than for crop farming. By its nature, pastoralism is an economic activity that requires large areas of grazing lands. In most pastoralist areas of Ethiopia, the land requirement for grazing is as large as 20 hectares or more per head of cattle. The arid and semi-arid lowlands of Ethiopia that are inhabited by pastoralists and semi-pastoralists are sparsely settled. Hence, with pastoral herding, population densities are extremely low.\nAs it has been said earlier, compared to pastoralist areas, crop-farming areas have \ngreater carrying capacity and higher densities of population. This is typically the case in the highland areas of Ethiopia where natural conditions are suitable for crop cultivation. In the crop-farming highland areas, the man-land ratio is significantly higher than the one in the pastoralist lowlands. \nHowever, the crop-farming areas of Ethiopia do not have uniform carrying capacities \nor population densities. Population density is significantly influenced by the types of crops cultivated. For instance, in the northern and north central highland areas of Ethiopia, the most cultivated crops are cereals. Cereals have relatively low yields per unit area. Therefore, these areas tend to have relatively lower carrying capacities and population density. In contrast, the southern, enset and coffee-growing regions \nof the country have greater yields per unit area. This is an important reason for the very high population densities in some zones and weredas of the southern region \nthat you read about earlier."

The permanent rural settlements of Ethiopia are mostly associated with the crop-farming highland areas of the country. \nThe permanent rural settlements of Ethiopia can also be broadly divided into \ntwo: the scattered (diffused or dispersed) settlements and the grouped (nucleated) settlements.

In urban settlements, on the contrary, the primary goods produced by the farmers, miners, or lumbermen are processed in manufacturing plants, transported, bought, sold, and financed. Urban settlements include residence in cities and towns. In addition, urban centers have always been centers of civilization and they are the intellectual and social capitals, perform functions of a political, educational, and social character. More vitally, urban centers, in economic spheres, are major transport centers, the main assembly and break of bulk points, the great markets, and the major financial nodes. \n The process of the development of urban settlements is known as urbanization. In \nmost parts of Africa, urbanization is a recent phenomenon, and it is attributed to colonialism. Urbanization in Ethiopia is not influenced by European colonialism. It is an unplanned, natural phenomenon of the late 19\nth and early 20th centuries."

For example, life expectancy has increased from 56.8 years in 2005 to 65.5 years in 2016). Three consecutive Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS) (2005, 2011, and 2016) have indicated declining trends in neonatal, infant, under-five and maternal mortality. Despite great progress, Ethiopia is still facing a high burden of disease.\nThe health extension program HEP has certainly contributed to the increased access \nand coverage of high-impact public health interventions in the country. Improved public health interventions such as malaria control efforts, access to safe drinking water, improved toilet facilities, and vaccination against childhood diseases are some of the factors behind the improved health outcomes in Ethiopia.\nThe  Government of Ethiopia has been investing heavily in health system \nstrengthening through its pro-poor policies and strategies that brought about significant gains in improving the health status of Ethiopians. Despite recognizable improvements, Ethiopia has still a heavy burden of diseases but a low rate of self-reported illness and low health facility coverage and utilization. The available literature indicates that the majority of ill health in Ethiopia is related to potentially preventable, communicable diseases and nutritional disorders. Some of the root causes of the poor health status of the population are:\n1. Lack of access to clean water: Rivers and lakes remain the most important sources \nof water particularly for people in rural areas although such waters are largely unsafe. \n2. Lack of adequate nutrition:  Studies reveal that malnutrition is rampant and is \namong the highest in the world. About half of the children under the age of five are \nmalnourished, stunted or wasted. Malnutrition remains high as the country has not attained food security, or due to poor knowledge about nutritional requirements and dietary habits. \n3. Disease related to beliefs, behaviors and traditional practices  which have a \nnegative effect on health status include Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), and early marriage.\n4. Lack of health services: The health care infrastructure of the country had suffered \nfrom underfunding, and health service coverage is less than 50% of the population. The services tend to be urban biased."

Population Growth and Environmental Degradation\nEnvironmental degradation is  a process through which the natural environment is \ncompromised in some way, reducing biological diversity and the general health of the environment.\nIn Ethiopia, massive environmental degradation has occurred during the last \nfew decades due to natural factors, unwise use of its natural resources, unsound ecological practices and population pressure. The major factor accelerating the environmental degradation rate is man‚Äôs abusive actions such as the removal of the natural vegetation cover through deforestation, over-grazing and inappropriate KEY TERMS"

Soil erosion is the main feature of land resource depletion leading to desertification which leads to reduced agricultural production and shortage of food. Overall, the effects of population pressure and resulting environmental degradation have driven the country into widespread food insecurity, drought and famine for the last three decades. The main activities that are responsible for environmental degradation in Ethiopia include the removal of vegetation cover and over cultivation as a result of the rapidly increasing population requirements for crop production and fuel wood. In addition, overgrazing and high livestock density resulted in the deterioration of rangeland resources.\nActivity 4.10\nIn pairs, discuss the following question. \n1. What are the indirect consequences of deforestation on socio-economic conditions?\nII. Population Growth and Food Production\nThe situation of food in Ethiopia during the last successive three decades is largely dominated by a decline in domestic food production. Ethiopian agriculture is dominated by small holder peasant farming which contributes about 95% of the annual food production of the country. This sector is dependent mainly on traditional and subsistent farming methods (with a very limited use of modern technologies) and rainfall. Moreover, the rising population pressure and clearing of forests to satisfy its basic demands such as food and energy made the soil susceptible to wind and water erosion that can affect both soil fertility and food production in Ethiopia.  \nThe sustained deterioration in the per capita food production and hunger has resulted in  widespread malnutrition, particularly among children in many parts of Ethiopia, which will lead to physical and mental impairment over the next successive decades.\nIII.

Increased forest clearance to create farmland, wood for construction purposes and forage has led to a shortage of fuel wood, deforestation, and environmental degradation. The forest cover resource of Ethiopia has been declining significantly over time. This is caused mainly by rapid population growth and the increasing population‚Äôs needs for forest resources such as wood and land. Many people in the country use wood for cooking, heating, and lightning, as well as for houses and furniture. Similarly, the increasing demand for agricultural and settlement lands is a major cause of forest destruction in the country. In Ethiopia, there is a direct correlation between population density and deforestation ‚Äì the more people there are in an area, the more trees they cut down. New trees do not spring up to replace the old ones.\nSuch deforestation has various negative consequences, both directly on the natural \nenvironment, and indirectly on the socio-economic conditions of the people.

Is \npollution a problem in your locality?\nWater and air pollution are mainly caused by human activities in households, \nindustries, farmlands, means of transportation, and so on. However, it can also be caused by natural events such as volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and the like. \nWhen an area is overcrowded (i.e. inhabited by a rapidly growing number of \npeople) the natural environment is polluted by a variety of unwanted and harmful wastes that peoples‚Äô activities produce. In Ethiopia, pollution is a major problem in overpopulated urban centers. In large cities like Addis Ababa, most people live in unsafe environments that have extremely polluted air and water. They are surrounded by the garbage and pollutants that households, industries, automobiles, and other sources discharge.\nIn Ethiopia, rapid population growth leads to environmental pollution by increasing \nemission of the amounts of pollutants such as: \n √ûSewage, solid wastes, and pollutant gases generated by households. \n √ûPollutant gases, liquids, and solid chemicals generated by expanded industries. \n √ûPollutant gases generated by the increasing number of automobiles. \n √ûAgricultural pollutants, such as fertilizers, pesticides, animal wastes, etc.\nFocus \nV.

Enset is the staple food of the people of these areas.\n c) Shifting Cultivation\nShifting cultivation is the cut-and- burn cultivation system. In Ethiopia, Shifting \ncultivation is practiced in western and southwestern fringes of the Ethiopian highlands and lowlands or Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambella and Southern Regions where population density is low and livestock rearing is limited areas.\nd) Plantation Agriculture\nIn Ethiopia, Plantation agriculture produces mostly cash or industrial crops like \nsugarcane, cotton, coffee, tea, and rubber. Such agricultural systems are found in areas either where there is abundant rainfall or irrigation is possible.\nII. Livestock Raising\nWhat is livestock raising?\nThe term livestock includes all animals that are kept on the farm to provide food, power, raw materials, or are meant for market. Ethiopia has a large livestock population that includes cattle, goats, sheep, Camels, poultry, and packed animals. In cattle population, Ethiopia stands first in Africa and tenth in the World.The Livestock sector is an important subsector of the nation‚Äôs economy and supports both the agricultural income and the Growth of Domestic Production.\n2.

It is a common feature of developing countries including Ethiopia. Both crop farming and animal rearing use traditional tools and techniques and hence, subsistence agriculture is hand-to-mouth in nature. As a result the products grown are primarily for family needs. This, therefore, leaves little surplus production entering the market.\nThe subsistence farming sector of Ethiopia produces varieties of food crops, which \ngrow in different agro-climatic conditions. The crops include cereals such as teff, wheat, barley, sorghum, etc. Enset is another major food crop cultivated in parts of southern, western and central Ethiopia. Pulses and oilseeds are also among the food crops grown in this sector.\nAgriculture in Ethiopia is typically characterized by smallholder and subsistence \nfarming which is highly dependent on rainfall. The urban livelihood is also highly dependent on the rural economy and as such small farm constitutes the life support mechanism of the country. Most agricultural households in Ethiopia, for example, mainly produce for own consumption but also for sale, which can have many purposes ‚Äì saving, procuring food or non-food items tax or loan repayment. These households purchase some of their inputs (fertilizer) and provide some (family labor) from their own resources. \nSubsistence farming is the practice of self-sufficiency in which the farmers focus \nonly on producing enough food for personal consumption. Thus it can play an important role in Ethiopia‚Äôs economy by reducing the vulnerability of rural food-insecure households, improving livelihoods. \n5.2.2  Contribution of Cash Crop Production to the \nEthiopian Economy\nCommercial farming as opposed to the subsistence farming sector, it is concerned \nwith producing crop for sale. Hence, the main objective of this sector is to make money. In this regard, Ethiopian farmers produce varieties of cash crops such as cofee, oilseeds, pulses, chat, sugar cane, cotton and fruit.

For example, agriculture supplies the country with food grains, dairy and meat products. The agricultural sector is also the supplier of foodstuff to consumers and  raw materials to agro- industries\nb) Source of Capital\n Cash crops provide a stimulus to agricultural innovation, by raising capital for agricultural investment and accelerating the build-up of institutions that enable further commercialisation.

The majority of the Ethiopians are farmers but they have not yet secured food at large. The Ethiopian agriculture reveals a picture of virtual stagnation in production; a rapidly rising population, and declining domestically produced food per capita. In other words, because of the instability in agriculture production, agriculture has failed to play the decisive role expected of it. The major obstacles to the development of this sector include:\nA.

Land degradation can reduce soil  fertility, depth, and essential nutrients and \nwater holding efficiencies  thereby reducing the crop production capacity.\nB. Variable Rainfall \nIt is a matter of fact that Ethiopian agriculture is heavily dependent upon unreliable \nrainfall which may produce surplus only in years of favourable weather. What is more it has not always been timely. Sometimes it comes early or late. Other times it falls short of the required amount or it falls in excess amount that can highly impact both productivity and food security.\nC. Fragmentation of Farm Plots and Small Size of Holdings\nThe land owned by peasants is getting smaller and smaller over time due to \ncontinuous division of farmland among the number of families in the form of inheritance. The agricultural lands are therefore highly fragmented. \nTable 5.2 shows that agricultural land is highly fragmented, the majority (38%) \nof households access less than 0.5 hectares of land, 23.65%  of households access between 0.51 to 1.0 hectares, 24.04% between 1 and 2 hectares, and that only the remaining 14.31% of households access more than 2 hectares of land.

Railways\nThe major advantage of rail transport is that it helps transport bulky products.For \nmore than a century; Ethiopia was served by an international meter gauge railway, from Addis Ababa to Djibouti. The railway was built from 1897‚Äì1917 and was about 781 km long primarily served to move export- imports for a long time. Compared to those of the developed countries the railway was backward. It was also a single lane track. Eventually, the Ethio-Djibouti Railway and its decades old rolling stock were lacking spare parts and were forced to close down over a number of years.\nRecently a new railway line of 752.7 km length connecting Addis Ababa to Djibouti \nwas officially inaugurated in Djibouti in 2018. The Addis Ababa‚ÄìDjibouti Railway is a new standard gauge international railway that serves as the backbone of the new Ethiopian National Railway Network. It provides Ethiopia with access to the sea, linking Addis Ababa with Djibouti and its Port of Doraleh. More than 95% of Ethiopia‚Äôs trade passes through Djibouti. The railway line has double-track for 115 km, from Addis Ababa to Adama, and a single track for the remaining 600 km to Djibouti. Power is supplied through 20 distribution stations 17 in Ethiopia and 3 in Djibouti.\nThe other important railway is Addis Ababa Light Rail Transit (AA-LRT). It is the \nfirst light rail and rapid transit in eastern and Sub-Saharan Africa. The total length of both lines (north-south and east-west) of the rail is about 31.6 kilometres, with 39 stations. It is estimated that AA-LRT currently transports about 60,000 people daily, significantly reducing traffic congestion in the capital, Addis Ababa.\nc. Inland Waterways\nWater transport is cheap and convenient for transporting bulky goods over long \ndistances. The use of Ethiopian rivers and lakes as inland waterways is extremely limited. This is due to the ruggedness of the topography and the seasonal nature of rainfall in most parts of the country. The only navigable river in Ethiopia is Baro. There is also small-scale transportation over lakes Tana, Abbaya and Ziway. \nd. Air transport\nFor countries like Ethiopia where the topography is difficult for communication, air \ntransport is of special significance. Air transport is the most recent and fastest mode of transportation. The Ethiopian Airlines, which is the major airlines in the country, is amongst the best airlines by African standards. Ethiopian Airlines (EAL) was established in 1945."

There are ways to make roads safe for motor \ntraffic, cyclists and pedestrians. It involves rules such as speed limits and those \nabout drinking and driving, and control systems, such as traffic lights and crossings.\nCurrent Accident Severity Definition in Ethiopia: \n1. A fatal accident is the one in which one or more individuals die as a result \nof a traffic accident within the same reporting 30 days of the occurrence \nof the accident. \n2. A serious injury  is one in which a victim sustains severe cuts, bleeding, \nbreaks, and other damages, which requires medical treatment as ‚Äúin-patient‚Äù in hospital. \n3. A slight injury  is the one as a result of which the victim sustains only small \ncuts, scratches, and other small damages which may be treated as an out-patient without requiring admission to a hospital. \n4. Property damage only  accident is the one as a result of which no person is \ninjured only one or more vehicles involved in the accident are damaged.\nRoad Traffic Accidents in Ethiopia\nRoad accidents are a global problem affecting all parts of society.

The Konso cultural landscape is characterized \nby dry stone terrace agriculture and walled town settlement. Dry stone terrace \nagriculture and walled town lifestyle might have been practiced for 400 years. The dry stone terrace agriculture is an indigenous adaptation to the dry environment of Konso that is mountainous, barren and rocky. These terraces retain the soil from erosion and create terrace saddles that are used for agriculture. The terraces are the \nmain features of the Konso landscape and the hills are contoured by the dry stone terraces that could reach at some places up to 5 meter high.The Konso  Cultural Landscape was officially recognised by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in 2011.\nFigure 5.6: Konso Cultural Landscape\n5.5.2  Tourism in Ethiopia\nWhat is tourism?\nTourism is a collection of activities, services and industries that delivers a travel experience, and they include transportation, accommodations, eating and drinking establishments, retail shops, entertainment businesses, activity facilities and other hospitality services provided for individuals or groups travelling away from home.

It also refers to the wider natural world of land, sea, and atmosphere. Humans have been interacting with their environment since people began to live on the Earth. For example, humans have been cutting forests to grow crops for centuries and by doing so we altered the environment. Conversely, the environment affects humans in many different ways as well. A simple example is the way we change our clothes in response to cold or hot weather .  \nA good climate, accessible clean water, fertile soil, etc. are aspects of the physical environment that enable people to live and thrive. However, harsh environments, such as a very hot or cold climate, limited water, and infertile land, make it more difficult for people to survive. Humans are also affected by major environmental events such as earthquakes, floods and drought that damage homes, property and agriculture. These can lead to the displacement of people and can cause injury, loss of life and destruction of livelihoods. They can also damage water sources and pipelines, causing water contamination and spreading waterborne diseases. \nThe relationship between human being and environment can be seen in three ways \nnamely; dependence, modification and adaptation.

Dependence on the Environment\nHow human being is dependent on physical environment? \nEvery single living thing on this planet is dependent on the environment it lives in. \nWhether it is for air, water, food, or shelter, living beings simply cannot survive without some form of interaction. Basically, everything you see around you is entirely dependent on environmental resources that come from thousands of miles away.\nB. Modification of the Environment\nHow can human modify his/her environment? \nHuman activities frequently result in environmental change, both with negative and positive results.Even the most ecologically sustainable farming methods and renewable energy projects require resources provided by nature. Human beings use increasing amounts of land to build homes, shopping centers, and schools. \nC. Adaptation to the Environment\n   How human beings adapt the environment?\nPeople seem to live in the strangest places on this planet, which is partly due to increased knowledge of the environment. The more successful species are able to adapt to changes in their environment, the more likely they are to survive. For example, there are people who live in different climatic regions such as the Arctic, deserts and dense forest regions. It proves how humans are adapted to the natural environment. \nThe links between human activities and the environment are complex and varied, \nbut can be grouped into two main types of activities:\n √ûuse of natural resources such as land, food, water, soils, minerals, plants \nand animals, and \n √ûproduction of wastes from a range of activities including agriculture, industry and mining, as well as wastes from our bodies. \n1)  Use of natural resources\nWe use many different types of natural resources in our daily lives. We depend on \nfood and water for survival and we need energy for many different purposes, from domestic cooking through to major industrial processes. Our clothes, transport,"

Let us take a simple example. Think of the resources that have been used to produce a notebook of the type you may be using right now as you study this subject. Manufacturing the paper needed raw materials of wood and water as well as energy for its production process. The trees that supplied the wood required soil, water and land to grow on. There may be ink or metal staples or other components in your notebook that were made from other types of resources. Our need for resources is vast and it is growing as the population and consumption per person increases with socio-economic progress. \nGlobally, both population and resource extraction increased by almost 50% in the \n25 years from 1980 to 2005. Over that time, the world population increased from 4.44 billion in 1980 to 7.8 billion in 2020. Metals are used in the manufacture of wide ranges of goods ‚Äì from cars to computers. Minerals are used in industrial processes and in construction to build houses and roads. Both metallic and non-metallic minerals are obtained from rocks that have been mined and are then processed in various ways to extract valuable resource. \nNatural resource extraction shows a steady increase from 1980 to 2005, with the \ngreatest amount extracted in the most recent years. The most likely reason is the increase in the global population in this period; more people need more resources. It could also be the case that the amount used by individuals and by wider society is increasing due to changes in behavior and levels of consumption. \nAdvances in technology have increased natural resource exploitation by enabling \npeople to reach new resources and to exploit more resources per capita.  For example, fishermen who use traditional technologies such as small boats are limited in the number of fish they catch. Modern industrial fishing fleets use very large ships that cover huge areas of the ocean at greater depths to catch many more fish. This can lead to overfishing, which means catching fish at a faster rate than they can reproduce.  \nOverfishing and other examples of over-exploitation of natural resources can \nresult in damage to or the loss of entire ecosystems. An ecosystem includes all the living organisms (humans, plants, animals, micro-organisms) and their physical environment (soil, water, air, land) and the interactions between them. If one component of the system is removed, this can have knock-on effects on the other parts of the system."

Use of Forest Resources \nOne particular problem caused by over-exploitation of forest resources is \ndeforestation, which occurs when forest areas are cleared and the trees are not replanted or allowed to regrow. In Ethiopia, clearing land for agriculture to meet the food needs of the growing population and the demand for fuel and construction materials has resulted in a steady loss of forest area, which is continuing as you can see from Figure 6.1. below. \nFigure 6.1: Proportion of Land area in Ethiopia Covered by Forest (%) \n(2002-2011).  Source: MoFED, 2012a)\nThe loss of forests has several undesirable consequences. Forests are home to many different types of trees, as well as other plants, and a wide range of animals from insects to birds and mammals. The conversion of forest lands to agriculture greatly reduces biodiversity, which is a measure of the variety of living organisms (all life forms). Biodiversity is important for humans because we use other living organisms to provide several essentials like: \n √ûFood: we use plants and animals such as fish, goats, wheat, rice, and maize \nas sources of food. \n √ûMedicines: many traditional medicines are made from plants and animals and new medicines are developed from them as well. \n √ûEcological services: living organisms, especially plants and microorganisms, play an important role in processes that maintain our lives and environment such as providing oxygen, cleaning the air, purifying water, breaking down wastes and controlling erosion. \nDeforestation is a significant contributory cause of soil erosion.

Loss of forests also has a \nsignificant impact on water supply. Tree roots reach deep into the soil and create spaces between the particles which increases soil permeability, allowing rainwater to soak in and replenish groundwater. \nII. Energy Resources\nThe use of renewable or non-renewable resources is a critical factor when considering energy resources. Fossil fuels have been the main energy source for global industrialization, but because they are non-renewable, the quantity is ultimately limited and their use is not sustainable over the long term. Furthermore, the burning of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change. There are several renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. The wood used as a fuel is renewable in the sense that trees will regrow but there are other disadvantages such as deforestation, as you have read. In Ethiopia, wind farms are harnessing wind power to generate electricity but the most important source of renewable energy in Ethiopia is water. Ethiopia already has several hydroelectric power stations and more are planned, including the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, currently under construction. Hydroelectric power is renewable because it makes use of the energy of flowing water but does not use up the water in the process. Another renewable energy source is solar power, using photovoltaic cells that convert the sun‚Äôs energy into electricity. \nIII. Water Resources\nThe direct use of water falls into three main categories: \n √ûdomestic uses, including drinking, washing and cooking;\n √ûagricultural uses, principally irrigation; and\n √ûindustrial uses, in manufacturing processes and for energy generation.\nThe relative proportions of these three categories \nvary in different parts of the world, but globally the sector using the most water is agriculture.\nFigure 6.2:  Global water withdrawal by sector. \n(Adapted from F AO, 2012)"

Rivers, lakes and wetlands are important habitats for wildlife and need a certain amount of water at all times to function properly within the system. This becomes a problem when the demand for water for human activities exceeds the supply.\nWater is not an endlessly renewable resource. In many parts of the world water \ndemand is significantly above sustainable water supply. Sustainable water supply means there are adequate supplies, in both quality and quantity, to meet the current and future needs of people and of the environment. \nMany countries are already experiencing water stress or scarcity. These terms refer \nto the volume of water available relative to the use and demand for it, which is linked to the population served.

Water-scarce countries have been defined as those with less than 1000 m\n3 of water per person per \nyear.

Waterborne diseases are caused by pathogens (disease-causing agents) in water and food that has been contaminated by the wastes from infected people. \nIndustry, agriculture and energy production all generate wastes that can pollute \nthe air, water and soil. Pollution means the introduction into the environment of substances liable to cause harm to humans and other living organisms. For example, the leather industry produces large amounts of liquid wastes from the tanning process. These wastes contain organic materials such as fat from the hides and toxic (poisonous) chemicals including some human carcinogens (cancer-causing agents). Another example is the release of so-called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, which contribute to human-induced climate change. \nFigure 6.4 summarizes the interactions between human activities and ‚Äòthe \nenvironment.

It may result from an increase in population, a decline in resources, a decline in the demand for labor, or a combination of these factors. In other words, overpopulation may take place where resource development does not go hand in hand with population growth, and where growth of tertiary services lags behind technical progress.\nAbsolute overpopulation may be distinguished from relative overpopulation, the \nformer occurring where the absolute limit of production has been attained though living standards remain low, while the latter indicates that present production is inadequate for the population although greater production is feasible. Relative overpopulation is more common than absolute overpopulation.\nOverpopulation may be found at various levels: rural, industrial, regional, national. \nRural overpopulation is common but is most striking in populous underdeveloped areas.

What are the causes of underpopulation? \nUnder population may be said to exist where a population is too small to utilize \nfully its resources, or where the resources could support a larger population without lowering living standards or increasing unemployment. The former is more frequent than the latter.\nAbsolute under population is quite rare, serve in the case of isolated population \nwhere numbers are incapable of normal demographic replacement of adequate economic production. Relative under-population takes place where there is insufficient development of the resources available; nowhere is it more common than in the southern continents.\nUnder population is when there are more resources in an area (for example, food, \nenergy and minerals) than can be used by the people living there. Under population is when a region or country has insufficient workers to exploit their resources efficiently, to support retired population and to provide growth. Therefore, too few people use all the resources of an area to the maximum efficiency.

The demands that this growth places on our global environment are threatening the future of sustainable life on earth. One of the largest environmental effects of human population growth is the problem of global warming. Some scientists fear that global warming will lead to rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions in the future. In order to support the growing population, forests are being destroyed at an alarming rate. Humans also continue to put a great demand on the natural resources of our planet. Many non-renewable resources are being depleted due to the unrestrained use of fuel and energy. Many parts of the world also suffer from a shortage of food and water. The growth of population puts demands on our already limited resources. The environment on earth is suffering from the growth of global population. The depletion of resources and biodiversity, the production of waste, and the destroying of natural habitats are serious problems that must be addressed in order to ensure that life on earth will be sustainable throughout the next century .\nPhysical environment means nonliving environment or the land, air, water, soil and minerals. The utilization, overuse and misuse of physical resources increased manifold due to the growth of human population. As it has been discussed earlier, more population means more mouths to feed which requires more agricultural production. Accordingly, more cultivable land has been made available by clearing forests and by reclaiming wetland, ponds and green belts. Feeding the growing population requires more advances in agriculture that in turn requires the utilization of more water, more fertilizers and more pesticides.\nIt is clear that the growing population demands more space to construct houses and \navailability of more consumer goods. It also requires more means of transport, more consumption of fossil fuels and more pollutants of air, land and water. Thus, the growth of population leads to pollution of air, land and water. To this effect, different types of pollutions are causing many problems in the physical environment that are further affecting the biological environment seriously.\nEthiopia is the most populous country in Africa with a higher rate of population \ngrowth. Its population was estimated to be over 101 million by 2016 and currently growing at a rate of 2.6%.

The population growth rate is much higher, and is increasing much faster than the economic growth rate and is growing beyond the carrying capacity of the country‚Äôs natural resources, such as land, water, soil, forest, etc. These negative results of rapid population growth have caused many environmental and socio-economic problems. For example, population growth causes serious environmental degradation in the area where it occurs, including deforestation, pollution, soil erosion, depletion of resources, etc.\nSome of the impacts of rapid population growth are discussed in detail hereunder . \nI. Deforestation\nWhat is deforestation? Can you mention some of the problems \ncaused by deforestation? Is deforestation a problem in your locality?\nDeforestation refers to the removal of forest cover of an area without adequate \nreplacement. In other words, it is the process of the indiscriminate destruction of the natural vegetation cover of a forest area.\nRemoval of forest has several consequences. Among these, the most important \none is the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which inturn results global warming.  During photosysnthesis plants absorb carbondioxide and release oxygen in which all heterotrophs can depend upon it.  Such circulation and interdepence can be disrupted by deforestation and finally result other species of biodiversity will be affected negatively. \nThe forest cover resources of Ethiopia have been declining significantly over time. \nThis is caused mainly by rapid population growth and the increasing population‚Äôs needs for forest resources such as fuel wood and land. Many people in the country use wood for cooking, heating, and lightening, as well as for houses and furniture. Similarly, the increasing demand for agricultural and settlement lands is a major cause of forest destruction in the country. In Ethiopia, there is a direct correlation between population density and deforestation ‚Äì the more people there are in an area, the more trees they cut down. New trees do not spring up to replace the old ones."

With  the  current annual loss of high  forests,  estimated  at  150,000-200,000  hectares, it has been projected  that the area covered by high  forests may be reduced to  scattered  minor  stands  of heavily  disturbed forests  in  inaccessible parts  of the country within a few decades.\nThe  major  reasons  for deforestation are  the  clearing  of forests and woodlands \nfor  cultivating crops  and  the  cutting of trees  and  shrubs for  various   purposes,  notably for  fuelwood,  charcoal,  construction materials,  etc. The fact that plantation forestry has been very far from meeting the demand for wood indicates the inevitability of deforestation.\nTable 6.1: Forest Resource Degradation in Ethiopia\nThe local area under vegetation cover Study years Forest cover \ndecline (%)% change year‚àí1\nSouth Wollo 1958‚Äì1986 30.6 & 51* 1.1 & 1.8*\nNorthwestern Ethiopian Highlands 1957‚Äì1995 98.9 2.6\nHawassa watershed 1972‚Äì2000 82 2.9\nNorthern Afar ranglands 1972‚Äì2007 89.9** 2.6\nGish Abbay watershed 1957‚Äì2001 64 1.5\nEastern Ethiopia highlands 1985‚Äì2011 63.4* 2.4\nCentral rift valley area 1973‚Äì2014 56.6 1.4\nGumara watershed, Lake Tana basin 1957‚Äì2005 85.3 & 91.4* 1.8 & 1.9*\nLibokemkem District, South Gonder 1973‚Äì2015 82.2 1.9\nAndassa watershed, Blue Nile Basin 1985‚Äì2015 45 1.6\nGelda catchment, North Western Ethiopia 1957‚Äì2014 83.8 1.5\nSouth-Western Ethiopia 1987‚Äì2015 54.4 1.9\nMuga watershed, Upper Blue Nile basin 1985‚Äì2017 21 & 12* 0.7 & 0.4*\nCentral Highlands of Ethiopia 1957‚Äì2017 37.8 0.6\nKomto protected forest East Wollega Zone 1991‚Äì2019 37.4 1.3\nLake Ziway watershed 1973‚Äì2018 76.4** 1.7\n* Shrublands (areas covered with small trees, bushes and shrubs which are less dense than \nforests)\n** Woodlands (areas covered by woody plants mainly acacia-dominated species)"

It also urges increased pressure on existing forests because of the increasing demand for fodder, fuelwood, and building materials. At a national level, biomass energy offers over 99% of the total domestic energy consumption (92% for households and the remaining being consumed by small-scale industry and food enterprises). From this, about 78% is derived from woody biomass, whereas around 12 and 9% are from animal dung and crop residue respectively.\nForest resources are also used as cash income sources through selling wood logs, \nfuelwood, and charcoal. During the last 50 years, charcoal production increased from one million tons to more than three million tons each year. Within this period, fuelwood consumption also increased from 40 to 100 million cubic meters in a year. These all had been done at the expense of forests. Encroachment of farmland and pasture into the natural forests had also been a common practice in many parts of Ethiopia. Such deforestation activities and overgrazing have led to soil erosion resulting in land quality deterioration, biodiversity loss, and impact on the overall climate system posing a serious problem in every aspect of human life\nII. Pollution\nThe term ‚Äòpollution‚Äô refers to any undesirable substance added or contaminated to environmental resources which are hazardous or potentially hazardous to human health, safety, and welfare or risky to the normal functioning of other living creatures. Pollution refers to any undesirable change in natural conditions of water, air, and other components of the natural environment that has negative effects on the health and activities of human beings and other living creatures.\n Environmental pollution is any change within the environment that affects the \nintegrity of an ecosystem. In most cases, such changes are caused by the action of human beings mainly due to urbanization, industrialization, construction and transportation activities, agricultural and land use management practices. Because of various unwanted substances released to the environment, the majority of natural resources have been affected, many destroyed and a large portion of it falls under immense threat."

Is \npollution a problem in your locality?\nWater and air pollution are mainly caused by human activities in households, \nindustries, farmlands, means of transportation, and so on. However, it can also be caused by natural events such as volcanic eruptions, wildfire, and the like.\nWhen an area is overcrowded (i.e. inhabited by a rapidly growing number of people)  \nthe  natural  environment  is  polluted  by  a  variety  of  unwanted  and harmful wastes that peoples‚Äô activities produce. In Ethiopia, pollution is a major problem in overpopulated urban centers. In large cities like Addis Ababa, most people live in unsafe environments that have extremely polluted air and water. They are surrounded by the garbage, and pollutants that households, industries, automobiles, and other sources discharge. \nPractically in Ethiopia, the agriculture sector is found to be the major source of \nenvironmental pollution. Application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides can easily contaminate living organisms, soil, water, meadows, and other vegetation. This has caused air pollution which continuously affects human health, and also triggers global warming. In such cases, indoor air pollution from biomass fuel is responsible for 50,320 annual under-5-year children deaths accounting for 4.9% of the national burden of disease in the country.\nAt the same time, pollution due to emissions from motor traffic and industrialization \nprocesses have also their share in polluting the environment. Chemical wastes and byproducts from industries and unmanaged urban waste disposal from major cities in open landfill sites are continuously polluting the environment. For instance, many of the leather processing industries in Ethiopia lack proper waste treatment methods. By its very nature, leather processing involves soaking, fleshing, washing, etc. to remove dirt, flesh, salt, and other foreign substances by making use of water.\nAs a result, different things like salt, pesticides, flesh, hair, suspended solids, sulfate, \nammonia, base, chlorides, acid, and other oxygen demanding substances might be released into the surrounding water bodies."

Land/Soil Degradation\nThe land serves as storage for water and nutrients required for plants and other \nliving micro-macro-organisms. The demand for food, energy and other human requirements depends upon the preservation and improvement of the productivity of land. The loss of arable land has been caused by a number of factors, many or most of which are tied to human development. The primary causes are deforestation, overexploitation for fuelwood, overgrazing, agricultural activities and industrialization.\nLand degradation involves both soil erosion and loss of soil fertility; hence, \nmeasurements of land degradation usually focus on the severity of soil erosion. Ethiopia with high-intensity rainstorms and extensive steep slopes, is highly \nsusceptible to soil erosion, especially in thehigh   lands. Erodibility also depends on \nthe soil depth and the organic content of the soil; a 1 percent increase in organic matter reduces erodibility by about15 percent. \nLand degradation is also a widespread problem in Ethiopia with over 85% of the land \nmoderately to very severely degraded and about 75% affected by desertification. In the country, degradation of land stems from the historical development of agriculture and human settlement in the highland regions. Recent estimates using satellite imagery shows that land degradation hotspots over the last three decades cover about 23% of the land area in the country, basically in large areas of Tigray, Wollo, and Gondar among others. \nThe factors influencing soil erosion and, therefore, land degradation are multiple \nand mutually reinforcing. As indicated earlier, the massive removal of vegetative cover is the driving force behind land degradation. This loss is largely due to an expanding population, with its corresponding increased demand for crops, grazing land, and fuel wood. The removal of vegetative cover for use as fodder and fuel leads to an increase in surface runoff and, thus, to higher soil erosion. With the"

In addition, there is a loss of soil nutrients anda reduction in water holding \ncapacity.\nWhen animal dung and crop residues are used for household fuel rather than recycled \ninto the soil, the soil loses nutrients and organic matter. As the fuel wood scarcity grows worse, women and children have to collect fuel wood from more distant sources and substitute more and more dung and crop residues for household fuel. In the intensively farmed rural areas as well as in the drought-prone degraded areas of the north and the east, cattle dung has already largely replaced wood as the primary household energy source. All of these factors combined lead to a reduction in crop productivity.They also contribute to crop failure, reduced cropping intensity, and decreased resistance to drought. This induces further land clearing and reinforces the vicious cycle of land degradation. As soil depth is reduced, croplands revert to grassland and ultimately to bare rock."

Natural Factors \nIt involve a combination of the following natural factors: steepness of slope (Topography), the intensity, duration and seasonality of rainfall, soil type (example, texture), torrent rivers during the summer and vegetation cover.\nII. Human-made Factors: \nHere are some of the many ways in which people have contributed to the erosion of the land that they depend on.\nÔÇß\tDeforestation: Most of the highlands of Ethiopia were once covered \nby forests. These forests provide habitats for animals and livelihood for humans; they also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change. Deforestation is progressing at a rapid rate and has become one of the main causes of Ethiopia‚Äôs hastened erosion rate.\nÔÇß\tOvergrazing (keeping too many livestock in a small spatial unit):  \nMost areas used for pastoral activities are overgrazed because too many animals have been kept there relative to their grass. The livestock destroys the vegetation faster than it can replenish itself. When the vegetation is destroyed, the land is laid bare and is therefore vulnerable to erosion. Among domestic animals goats are particularly damaging. They destroy all kinds and parts of an area‚Äôs vegetation, including the roots.\nÔÇß\tBad cultivation practices: Bad cultivation practices also speed up erosion by making the soil vulnerable to the natural forces that we have just described a few lines above. For example,\no Over cropping ‚Äì It is the act of planting an area too densely. \nThis approach to farming uses up the soil‚Äôs nutrients faster than natural processes can replenish them and destroys the land‚Äôs fertility.\no Over cultivation ‚Äì This one entails tilling land every year.

In farming, this practice is sometimes used periodically to strip an area before leaving it to lie fallow to regain its nutrients. However, since the soil is now bare and therefore unprotected, the land is vulnerable to the forces of erosion. Slash-and-burn techniques are also used to clear forestland in order to prepare it \nfor farming, but unwittingly exposing the soil for erosion.\nIn Ethiopia, about 1.9 billion tons of topsoil are washed away from the highlands \nevery year. River Abbay alone carries away 3000 ‚Äì 4000 million cubic metric tons of soil annually. The loss of topsoil has been estimated to cost billions of Ethiopian birr per year.

However, these resources are under the influence of various interconnected factors like population pressure, agricultural expansion, migration, rapid urbanization, resettlement, climate change, and environmental pollution that result in serious degradation.\n üåçThe major problem of Ethiopia‚Äôs soils is erosion by running water. Both human-made and natural factors are responsible for erosion. Attempts have been underway to check erosion through reforestation, afforestation, terracing, constructing check dams, plugging gullies, contour ploughing, strip cultivation, etc.\n üåçLong term human occupation of the highlands of Ethiopia, accompanied by sedentary agriculture and extensive cattle herding activities, in combination with population pressure have resulted in the heavy deforestation, and subsequent wild animals extinction. The forest resource stock that had covered 40 percent of the country has come to less than 3 percent these days. However, due to the recently adopted Ethiopian government strategy known as ‚ÄúGreen Legacy‚Äù, the forest area coverage has been raised up to about 15.7%, as indicated by National Forest Inventory report of 2018.\n üåçHence, the Ethiopian government has taken several steps to address these problems like launching soil and water conservation campaign, tree planting programs, developing water resources conservation and management policy and others. Moreover, awareness has been created at all levels through school syllabi and extension services to mitigate the problem."

Do you remember what you have learned  about \nmap?\nA map is a simplified, diminished, plain representation of all or part of the earth‚Äôs \nsurface as viewed vertically from above.\nThe main features of maps: \n √ûA map represents all or part of the earth‚Äôs surface. For example, a map might \nshow a city such as Addis Ababa, the entire world, or a section of a garden. \n √ûA map is a two-dimensional (plane) representation. For example, a map might be printed on a piece of paper. \n √ûMaps show the earth‚Äôs surface as if it were seen from directly above. This view is called a bird‚Äôs-eye view. \n √ûAll maps are smaller than the area they represent. \n √ûMaps are drawn to scale. In other words, the features shown on a map have the same relative proportions as they do in reality. \n √ûMaps are simplified representations. \n √ûMost maps use generally accepted symbols to represent natural, artificial or cultural features of the area they represent. They also use conventional notations to provide background information such as the map‚Äôs title, date and scale. \nActivity 8.1\nIn a small group, discuss the following questions.\n1. What does ‚ÄúA map is a two-dimensional plane representation‚Äù? \n2. Compare and contrast maps and globes. \nHistorical Development of Map\nMaps are among our oldest tools. People created maps even in primitive times. For \ninstance, men and women sketched their routes to hunting, fishing and gathering grounds. Today, we also prepare maps, for many purposes. However, map-making has passed through many stages of development since its beginning. The two main"

Traditional Map Making\nThe art of traditional map-making is as old as the human race. Traditional maps \nhave been made in many ways. For example, early map materials included sticks, shells, clay tablets, parchment, paper, and solid plates of silver. Many traditional maps were locational. For example, they have shown the locations of water holes and hunting grounds and have included paths that led to these places.\nIn traditional map-making, collecting measurements of distances, directions, areas and \nlocations was one of the greatest challenges. Each measurement was being made by hand, through fieldwork in the area being mapped. This process was laborious and tiresome. Often the accuracy of the resulting information is imperfect and therefore not fully dependable.\nFocus \nAnother main difference between traditional and modern maps is that a traditional \nmap might include drawings of three-dimensional objects. As a result, a traditional map might besomewhat pictographic (or physiographic) rather than strictly diagrammatic.\nB. Modern Map Making\nModern scientific mapping has its roots in the 17\nth century. Several developments \nduring the Renaissance gave impetus to accurate map-making (cartography). \nFurthermore, advancements in science and technology resulted in the invention of better cameras and airplanes specially designed to take aerial photographs. Today, map-makers have diverse opportunities to acquire spatial information. In addition to aerial photography, satellite imagery provides a wealth of information.\nNowadays, the use of computers has become common in cartography. This is \nbecause computers are found valuable to assist in making maps. The last four decades have witnessed that computers have become an integral part of almost every stage of the cartographic process. This process includes collection, storage, analysis and presentation and even in the mapmaking and reproduction of maps."

What are the major \nuses of maps?\nMaps are used for identifying locations, distance, area and direction.\nLocation: A map shows the exact site of a place as well as the general situation \nrelative to other areas. For example, Ethiopia‚Äôs location can be \nexpressed in terms of its neighbouring countries, external land masses and water bodies. It is also possible to locate a place using astronomical grid references ‚Äì parallels and meridians. \nDistance: With the help of a map, we can measure the distance between places. \nThis is done by using the scale of the map. For example, the air distance between Hawassa and Addis Ababa can be calculated by using a map of Ethiopia.\nArea: the size of a certain place, a country, a region, a continent can be calculated \nfrom a map. This is done by measuring the length and the width of the given place on the map and by converting them to ground distances with the help of the scale of the map.\nDirection: A map can enable us to identify the direction and bearing of any place on \nthe map. This is accomplished by referring to another place\nActivity 8.2\nAnswer the following questions \n1. Name the two methods of map making.\n2. What are the major characteristics of modern map-making?\n3. Give a brief account of the uses of maps.\n8.1.2  Basic Components of a Map\nA map should include the following components namely: the title, scale, direction, grid reference, legend, date, place of publication and publisher, the magnetic declination (variation), and compass."

This information indicates the extent to which the area that is represented in the map has been reduced.\nDirection or orientation (North) arrow: Shows the north direction on the map.\nBy convention, cartographers or map makers place North at the top of maps. \nGrid reference: The map needs to have a coordinate system in the form of parallels \nof latitude and meridians of longitude so that the area can be placed in its proper geographical location on the globe.\nLegend/Key: There must be a legend or key that explains the symbols used by the \ncartographer. The map legend explains the meaning of the signs and symbols used in the map.\nDate/Year of publication: it identifies the year in which the map was published. \nBecause this information tells you how old the map is, you might be able to judge whether the map‚Äôs contents are current or might be out of date.\nPlace of publication and publisher: It tells where the map was published and \nidentifies the organization that published the map."

How can a national grid system \nhelp us to identify the position of a place on a map?\nThe criss-cross reference lines on a map is called Grid. The grid provides a frame of \nreference for locating points on a map. The vertical and horizontal lines of the grid cross at the points called Co-ordinates ‚Äì Each of these lines are numbered. The lines that run horizontally are called Northings. The lines that run vertically are called Eastings. These lines are the basis for reference to landmarks and places shown on the map. There are two types of grid references: \n √ûThe four digit grid reference \n √ûThe Six digit grid reference\nThis point is the southwestern corner of the whole grid for the country and it is called the grid origin or the National grid origin. \n √ûThe grid origin of Ethiopia lies in south-west most corner, is at the point in \nSW Kenya where the 340 30‚ÄôE meridian crosses the equator (00 ). \n √ûSuch a grid system provides the position of any point, in kilometres and fractions of kilometres east and north of the grid origin. \n √ûFrom the origin, all vertical lines are numbered eastwards. They are called eastings. \n √ûAll horizontal lines are numbered northwards. They are called northings. \n √ûIn contrast to meridians, eastings (verticals) do not indicate true north.\nThe Four Digit Grid Reference\nIt is common on a map drawn on a small scale. The 10 Km sides of the square are \nmarked with numbers that increases towards East and North. The Northing and Easting are numbered at every 10 Km intervals. Again, each side of the square is divided into 10 units (1 unit represents 1 Km).\nExample \nFind the four digit grid reference for point F using Figure  8.8."

True North is the northerly direction along a line on \nLongitude (Meridian Direction). The earth spins on an axis, which passes through the North and South poles. The North Pole is geographical North; or true North. Lines drawn from the North Pole to the South Pole are true north-south lines.

It uses horizontal \nor vertical bars to show different amounts of the same item or different values for the same phenomenon. The heights or lengths of the bars on a graph are proportional to the quantities they represent. Such a graph might show how amounts or values differ from place to place or as they change over time.\nFor example, a bar graph can be used to show how rainfall varies from month to \nmonth in a certain place. The following bar graph has been prepared based on the data given in Table 8.5. It shows the monthly distribution of rainfall in Kokosa town West Arsi Zone of Ethiopia. \n. Steps used to draw a simple bar graph:\n1. The horizontal scale usually represents the independent variable, more specifically \nwhen the time element is of significant, such as when graphing mean monthly rainfall \nor annual production. \n2. All bars must start at zero and bar graphs are drawn for the purposes of comparison \nmust be drawn on the same scale. \n3. When vertical bars are drawn, the time sequence should be from left to right. \n4. The width of the bar is a matter of choice. However, avoid bars that are too thick or \ntoo thin. \n5. The value of each bar can be assessed more easily if  space or gap is left between \neach bar.\nCompare a single feature as it exists in different places or as it changes over time. \nFor example, they can represent such statistical data as annual rainfall distribution on a monthly basis.
