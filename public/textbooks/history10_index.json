In the capitalist system, most means of production are privately owned. The growth of capitalism was influenced significantly by the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution first started in England in the 18\nth century. The \ngreat Industrial Revolution was mainly responsible for the tremendous economic transformation in Western Europe and the United States of America in the nineteenth century. After England, Belgium, France, and the German states were European countries that became industrialized.Following the Industrial Revolution, new sources of energy and power, particularly coal and steam, replaced wind and water powers.  The Factory system was created to replace the domestic system (in which individual workers used hand tools or simple machinery to fabricate goods in their own homes or workshops attached to their homes). Industrialization promoted the development of new socio-economic classes, especially the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.\nDuring the early modern period, Europeans built a transatlantic economy in which \nthe slave trade and slavery played a key role. Modern industrial capitalism arose from eighteenth-century transatlantic commerce. Europeans made a large amount of money through their network of colonies and sugar, cotton, and tobacco plantations. These riches sometimes referred to as ‘capital’, were used to fund Europe’s industrialization. As a result, the transatlantic slave trade and plantation riches were important factors in the development of capitalism in Europe. For example, the slave trade delivered tremendous •\tExplain the meaning of capitalism and how it evolved;\n•\tDescribe the salient features, owners of the means of production in the capitalist system;\n•\tWhat do you know about the free market economy?BrainstormingLearning outcomes of the lessonAt the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:\n•\tdefine the features of capitalism;\n•\texplain the role of the  Industrial Revolution in the establishment of the capitalist system; and \n•\trecognise why capitalism first emerged in  Western  Europe."

Textile mills subsequently played a key \npart in the rise of the city of Manchester.\nThe means of production in the capitalist system are owned by a small group of wealthy \nindividuals known as capitalists or bourgeoisie. The proletariat receive wages for their labour. The creation of products and services in a capitalist economy is based on demand and supply, or free commerce and competition, as in a market economy. The government imposes fewer restriction and interferes less. The capitalist economy differs from the socialist economy’s central planning structure, which is also known as a command economy. A command economy is one in which the government is in charge of the economy.  It is also an economy in which the government controls the volume of production, their distribution and prices. \nChart 1.1  Features of Capitalism\nIn countries like Germany and Italy, industrialization was linked to the mass militarization and nationalism, which ultimately led to World War I. Then these countries felt that they had to build up colonial empires in order to compete with the longtime colonial powers such as Great Britain and France."

These include: the Renaissance, the Protestant Revolution, and the \nexpansion of commerce.\nThe Renaissance with its developments of national language and its literature, helped to \nbring about a national self-consciousness; the Protestant Revolution broke out religious unity of Europe and ended the supremacy of the pope. Trade and colonies brought in wealth and helped to build a strong state.•\tDo you think that nation is an important part of our identity? Give reasons for your answer.      Brainstorming\nThe first few years after the Napoleonic era were called a time of “reaction” when those in power wanted to return to old orders. These were conservatives who opposed change. Britain, Russia, Prussia and Austria drew the “Treaty of Vienna” in 1815, with the objectives to  reverse all the changes that were brought about in Europe during the reign of Napoleon wars and restore the monarchies. On the other hand, there were revolutionaries who spread the ideas of nationalism and opposed conservatism. Nationalism is a feeling of belonging and loyalty that causes people to think \nof themselves as a Nation. It is the sense of belonging or feeling proud of your own country. It comes with a feeling that makes people support their nation and government in every activity that she/he chooses to engage in.

Italy in 1815 faced three obstacles to unity. \n•\tThe first was the Austrian occupation of Lombardy (Lombardia) and Venice in the north and northeast of the Italian peninsula.\n•\tThe second was the Papal States, the principality under the sovereignty of the pope; the Papal States straddled the centre of the peninsula, cutting the north off from the south. Often foreign powers, as for instance France in 1849, intervened to protect Papal independence. \n•\tThe third obstacle was formed by the existence of several independent states. On the French border was the Kingdom of Sardinia, also called Piedmont-Sardinia, which had slowly expanded since the Middle Ages and was the most advanced state in Italy.The Kingdom of Sardinia consisted of the region called Piedmont in northwestern Italy and the island of Sardinia. The Kingdom of the two Sicilies occupied the southern half of the peninsula and the island of Sicily. Other small states were the duchies of Tuscany (Toscana), Parma, and Modena, all governed by relatives of the Habsburgs, the family that ruled Austria. In each of these states, the monarch exercised absolute powers of government."

Mazzini viewed “Nation States” to be a necessary and opposed monarchy. He was a member of the Carbonari, a secret society of Italian unification formed to abolish foreign rules in Italy. In 1831, Mazzini founded a movement called “Young Italy” which attracted tens of thousands of Italians. He wanted a liberal democratic republic to govern a united Italy. Mazzini played a leading role in the 1848 Revolution. For a short period, he was a leader of a Roman republic proclaimed in the Papal States. But the French forces overthrew the republic established by Mazzini. \nCount Camillo di Cavour: In 1852, Cavour became prime minister of the \nindependent Kingdom of Sardinia. He was an aristocrat and well-educated. He took part \nin the 1848 revolutions. He strengthened Piedmont by promoting industry, encouraging railroad building, improving agriculture, fostering education and enlarging the army.  Cavour disliked absolutism and favoured the British type of parliamentary government. He wanted Italy to be both industrialized and united. He tried to reduce the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in politics. Since Austria was the greatest obstacle to Italian unity, Cavour searched for allies against Austria. In 1858, Cavour and Napoleon III made a secret agreement. Napoleon agreed to send troops to drive the Austrians out of Lombardy and Venetia if Austria declared war on Sardinia. 1.

The combined \nSardinia-French forces defeated the Austrians. Sardinia got Lombardy and Venetia from this war. France was to keep Nice and Savoy. Parma, Modena and Tuscany drove out their pro-Austrian rulers, and by plebiscites, they voted to be annexed to Sardinia.\nGiuseppe Garibaldi: In southern Italy, Italian nationalists were led by Giuseppe \nGaribaldi. He led the Red Shirts, an army that wore bright red shirts into battle. They \ncaptured the island of Sicily and then crossed into the Italian mainland. They conquered \nSouthern areas and agreed to unite with Piedmont-Sardinia in the north. He agreed to hand over power to Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia.\nIn 1861, the kingdom of Italy was established, and King Victor Emmanuel II became its \nking. The new kingdom included every part of Italy except Venetia and the Papal States. The Unification of Italy was completed when these two regions became part of Italy.\nIn 1866, following the defeat of Austria in the Seven Weeks War (war between Austria \nand Prussia), Italy got Venetia. When the Franco-Prussian war broke out in 1870, all of the French armies withdrew from Italy. Then, the Italians entered Rome and this finalized the unification of Italy in the same year; Rome was proclaimed the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. The Pope, however, continued to govern a section of Rome known as Vatican City.\nFigure 1.2   Count Camillo di Cavour"

The development of the German railway was the first indicator of a unified state. As travel became easier, faster, and less expensive, Germans started to see unity.\nDuring the Revolution of 1848, the German liberals initiated a movement for a \nunified Germany. The movement emphasized the importance of tradition, education, and linguistic unity of people in a geographic region. However, the Revolution of 1848 failed in its attempt to unify the German-speaking states because of division of the German ruling classes on the type of government they wanted to establish."

He came from the Junker class, or the landed nobility, in Prussia. He was a prominent figure in Prussian politics. In 1862, the new Prussian king, Wilhelm I, chose Bismarck as prime minister. Bismarck favoured German unification under Prussian leadership. Prussia was a very wealthy German state. It had large coal deposits in the Ruhr Valley, and a flourishing iron and steel industry. Prussia had a strong army and the military was glorified. Otto von Bismarck led Germany towards unification using his political philosophy of realpolitik, or “the politics of reality” and the \"Blood and Iron\" policy (Mil-itary power).\nRealpolitik : pursue goals by any means necessary (go to war, lie, break treaties) \n“Blood and Iron” policy- using military power to achieve unification of Germany.\nGerman unification was achieved by the force of Prussia. The unification movement was enforced from the top-down, a product of Prussian royal policies. Otto von Bismarck led German unification by appealing to national feelings and through the following three wars:\n•\tDanish War 1864 (against Denmark),\n•\tSeven Weeks War 1866 (against Austria), and \n•\tFranco-Prussian War -1870/71 (against France)."

The Union wanted to abolish slavery in the USA, whereas the Confederates wanted to keep slavery as it formed the basis of their economy. Most of the fighting took place in the south, leaving the southern states devastated. The seceding southern states did not aim to take over the United States government. Rather, they wanted to declare themselves independent.\nFor nearly a century, the people and politicians of the northern and southern states had been clashing over economic interests, cultural values, the power of the federal government to control the states, and, most importantly, slavery. These issues eventually led to the civil war.\nThe southern economy depended mainly on cotton. The white plantation owners in the \nsouthern states viewed slavery as essential for their survival. As the economy of the northerners was based more on the industry than agriculture, they hired people as factory workers at low wages, thus reducing the need for enslaved people in the north.\n This economic disparity led to opposing differences in societal and political views.

The South, however, continued to hold onto a social order based on white supremacy in both private and political life. Many in the north came to view slavery as not just socially unjust, but morally wrong.\nIn the north, there was a strong anti-slavery movement known as Abolitionism. The term \nabolitionist generally refers to dedicated opponents of slavery in the early 19\nth century \nAmerica. In the 1830s, the movement gathered some momentum. Some famous leaders of this movement were William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass. \nAbraham Lincoln won the presidential election in the year 1860. He amended the \nconstitution. Lincoln and the Republicans promised to prevent the spread of slavery into newly incorporated territories.

Later, amendments were made to the constitution that strengthened the principles of equality. This was a turning point in the American civil war. Many slaves from southern states flocked to the north and join the Federal army. The last Confederate surrender occurred on November 6, 1865.

It occurs when one country subjugates another, conquering and exploiting its people. The notion of colonialism is inextricably tied to that of imperialism, which is defined as the policy or belief of using power and influence to rule another nation or people.\nColonialism has been practised since ancient times. The ancient Greeks, Romans, \nOttomans, and others established colonies overseas. Colonialism grew in scope since the 16\nth century, after the Age of Discovery. This was owing to advancements in navigational \ntechnology that allowed Europeans to travel to all corners of the earth.\nFollowing the end of the Atlantic Slave trade, Europeans began trading with Africa in \nwhat became known as “legitimate trade.” The term “legitimate commerce” refers to the commodity trade between Africans and European merchants after the slave trade was abolished. During this time raw products from Africa, particularly cash crops, were exchanged for goods from Europe. \nThe era of “legitimate” trade shifted the relationship between Africa and Europe \nfrom commerce based on human merchandise to merchandise of tropical crops. This heightened competitiveness, resulting in a race for Africa. Between the final quarter of the eighteenth century and the 1870s, a large number of European explorers travelled out into the heart of Africa to conduct “exploration\".\nBased on the timing and purpose, European ‘explorers’ may be loosely divided into two \ngroups. First, the European explorers who arrived before the 1850s are believed to have been inspired by a spirit of pure and objective scientific inquiry. Second a considerable number of explorers who arrived after the 1850s were European government agents."

Missionaries came into Africa along with colonial administrators and traders with the plan to introduce Christianity, commerce and civilization. They cooperated and united as vital element in the attainment of their set goals. Missionaries in critical times of need, depended on traders for funds, and relied completely on administrators for physical security and protection.\nHowever, European missionaries preaching Christianity in Africa in the last two \ndecades of the nineteenth century converted only less than 1% of non-Muslim Africans (outside Ethiopia) to Christianity. Because of their lack of success, the missionaries began to appeal to their respective European governments for help."

Economic:  Demand for raw materials and the need for new market centres were the most visible ones. The 1800s was a time of great industrialization in Europe. Factories required raw materials that could be manufactured into marketable products. When Europeans returned to Africa for more resources they brought back the manufactured goods and sold them to Africans. Africa was believed to have a great amount of untapped raw material resources (agricultural products like groundnuts, palm oil, wood, cotton and gum; and mining like rubber, gold, and diamonds).\nB. Political/ Strategic interest:\nMajor world powers like Great Britain, France, and Spain were competing for power and prestige. European powers were more interested in dominating strategic territories and favourable locations for military and naval bases.\nC. The Civilizing Mission and the White Man’s Burden:\nThe civilizing mission is a rationale for intervention or colonization of other non-western peoples like Africa. The Europeans presented themselves as having a mission of spreading civilization, commerce and Christianity across the globe. The clear implication of this was that Africans were inferior and uncivilized and Europeans were superior and civilized. Another concept which is closely related to the civilizing mission is the so called ‘the white man’s burden.’ Originally, the white man’s burden was a poem written by an English poet, Rudyard Kipling in 1899. This poem proposes that white people should rule over non-white people until they can take their place in the world by fully adopting western ways.\nD. Religious factor:\nSome missionaries supported the colonization of African countries believing that European control would provide a political environment that would facilitate their missionary activities in Africa. \nExercise 2.2\nRead the following poem entitled “The White Man’s Burden” written by Rudyard Kipling and answer the question below:1. How does Kipling describe the subjects of colonial rule?"

The main goal of the conference was to talk of dividing up Africa among the European Colonial powers.\nThe competition between European powers intensified when King Leopold II of \nBelgium and Germany entered the competition for African colonies. King Leopold II of Belgium wanted to make Congo his personal colony and for this reason, he employed H.M. Stanley to explore the Congo River. Before the Berlin conference, in 1884, Germany had proclaimed Togo, Cameroon, and South-West Africa (Namibia), and in 1885, Tanganyika, as its protectorate.\nAt the Conference, the participants decided on the “General Act of the \nConference,” which laid international guidelines for colonization has 38 articles.  The Berlin Conference marked the real beginning of colonization in Africa.\n1. Principle of effective occupation: According to Article 35 of the Final Act, \nColonial powers could acquire rights over colonial lands only if they possessed them: if \nthey had treaties with local leaders, if they flew their flag there and if they established an administration in the territory with a police force to keep order.\n2. Doctrine of the Sphere of Influence- According to article 34 of the General Act of the \nBerlin Conference, any fresh act of taking possession of any portion of the African coast would have to be notified by the power taking possession to the other signatory powers. The conference resolved to end slavery in Africa.\n3. The Congo Free State (today’s Democratic Republic of the Congo) was confirmed as \nthe private property of King Leopold II of Belgium.4. Free navigation of the Niger and the Congo."

What were the effects of European explorers’ and missionaries’ activities \non Africa? \n2.4. Colonial Policies and Administration\nThe European colonial governments used different methods of administration to \nadminister colonies in Africa. These methods of administering varied from territory to territory and also among imperial powers. These methods include company rule, direct rule and assimilation, indirect rule as well as settler ruler.\n 2.4.1 Company Rule\nIn the early days of colonialism, European nations allowed the establishment of private companies that were granted large African territories to administer. These companies were formed by businessmen who were interested in exploiting the natural resources of the African territories. The company rule was exercised from the 1880s to 1924. The British South Africa Company (B.S.A.C), is an example of company rule, it was formed in 1887 and lasted longer than the British East African Company. The B.S.A.C., under the control of John Cecil Rhodes, used force and coercion to administer three territories Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia. The Company governed these colonies until 1924.The companies’ rule failed due to a shortage of finance and opposition from Africans and missionaries over their harsh company rule. Europeans were successful in rapidly partitioning Africa during the scramble, because of \nthe following reasons:1. The major factor for European victory over Africa was the military superiority that      they enjoyed  over  Africa. European powers were using professional and well trained      armies.2. Lack of cooperation and solidarity among Africans. Those weaknesses were made use     of by Europeans to their advantage.\n"

In the direct rule system, African indigenous rulers and local governments were removed and replaced by European personnel. African chiefs were assigned at the lower levels of the administrative structure to collect taxes, recruit labour and suppress rural African opposition. Under the direct rule, the French government considered its African colonies as part of France.\nThe French colonial policy of direct rule and assimilation was designed by Albert \nSarrout. The French colonial policy also incorporated association. According to the \nassimilation policy, an African, after receiving French education, stood a chance of becoming a French. Assimilation accepted the inherent superiority of French culture over all others. So, in practice, the assimilation policy in the colonies meant the extension of What  do you understand from the Rhodes Colossus cartoon? \n "

It was \nthe opposite idea of the assimilation policy. It implied that the relationship between the conqueror and the conquered should be one of “association ‘, not of identity and merging; it emphasized cooperation between the rulers and the ruled.\n 2.4.3 Indirect Rule\nThe architect of the British Indirect rule policy was Frederick Lugard. Lugard exercised this policy when he was a governor of Nigeria and British East Africa. This system of governance used indigenous African rulers within the colonial administration. Frederick Lugard, in his book the Dual Mandate in British tropical Africa, published in 1922, explained the importance of the indirect rule. According to him, indirect rule was preferable to administer colonies in Africa because it was the cheapest and most effective way. It also reduced African resistance. Unlike the French, the British made greater use of African customary law. The British indirect rule aggravated ethnic differences that emphasized differences in the dialect of language, dress, and religion.\n 2.4.4 Settlers Rule\nEuropeans came and settled in Africa, in many cases, displacing indigenous Africans. Settler colonies were found in southern Africa including the colonies of South Africa, Southern and Northern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe and Zambia), Angola, Mozambique, and South West Africa (Namibia). In addition, settler rule was practiced in Kenya, a British colony in East Africa, and Algeria, a French colony in North Africa. Here the fertile lands of the African peasants were taken and given to minority white settlers.\n The administration was very harsh on Africans and racist. Due to settler rule, Africans \nbecame labourers and landless tenants. In Kenya, for example, the Kikuyu, who lost their ancestral territory in the so-called white highlands to European settlers, migrated in mass to growing urban centres like Nairobi in search of employment.\nIn general, colonial administrative policies implemented by European colonial rulers \nvaried from country to country. Despite these differences, all colonial governments shared certain common features, such as:-\n•\tAll colonial systems were undemocratic,\n•\tColonial rule was most often imposed without consent from the African people, and \n•\tAll forms of colonial rule engaged in “divide and rule”."

Nonviolent forms of anti-colonialism included the use of the indigenous press, trade unionism, organised religion, associations, literary and art forms, and mass migrations. \nThere was armed resistance in different parts of Africa. The first or early African \nresponses to the colonial conquest occurred from about 1880 to 1914. The second stage covered from 1914 to1945. The third stage conducted from the 1950s to1980s was a period of decolonization of Africa. It was characterized by the emergence of national liberation movements that aimed at achieving independence."

Ahmadu Seku:Ahmadu Seku was one of the prominent leaders of the Tukulor Empire in West Africa. From 1830s to 1845, he resisted French rule in western Africa using various methods. In the beginning, he preferred to use diplomacy over armed resistance. But when the French violated their promise and started territorial expansion, Ahmadu forces clashed with the French-Senegalese troops. The French had recruited soldiers from the local people for their colonial goal. Finally, Ahmadu’s forces were defeated and his empire broke up. He was exiled to Sokoto, where he died. Then after, the French allied with Ahmadu’s brother to control the region.B. Samori TureSamori Toure (ca. 1830–1900): He was a Muslim leader in the Mandinka Empire, who engaged the French in protracted armed resistance from 1882 to 1898. Samouri was successful in uniting under his administration most of the people in the vast area between the source of Niger and the Upper V olta basin. He led a strong army of 30,000 men. Samori Ture, who governed an area in what is today Guinea, Mali, and Cote D’Ivoire strongly resisted French colonial expansion.\nFigure 2.2  Samori\nIt was not until 1900 that the French finally captured Samori.

After the bloody war, the British defeated the local resistance and were able to establish their colony of the Gold Coast over all of Ghana in 1900.\nThe British used the strategy of divide and rule and their superior weapons as well as \nrecruited African troops, to conquer the whole  of Nigeria in 1910.\n 2.5.2 Resistances in East Africa The Maji-Maji Uprising\nThe Maji Maji Uprising in Tanganyika was the most significant African challenge to \nGerman colonial rule from 1905 to 1907. The four German colonies in Africa were Tanganyika (modern-day Tanzania), Togo, Cameroon, and Namibia. The German rulers imposed high taxation and a system of forced labour on their colonial subjects. They were forced to grow cotton and build roads for their European occupiers. As a result, a movement against the Germans led by a prophet Kinjikitle Ngwale erupted in Tanganyika. Ngwale taught the people to sprinkle their bodies with sacred water known as Maji Maji  which “would turn bullets of their enemies into water.”\nThe rebellion spread throughout the colony, eventually involving 20 different ethnic groups who wished to dispel the German colonizers. The Maji Maji movement was \na spontaneous rising with no previous planning and central leadership. The Germans followed a ‘scorched earth' policy, destroying villages and crushing the uprising.\n 2.5.3 Resistances in South Africa\nThe Germans’ rule in Africa was harsh and characterized by land alienation. In South West Africa, for instance, land was taken from Africans and given to German settlers. The indigenous Herero and Nama peasants were forced to reduce their grazing land. Following the cattle epidemic of 1896-97, white settlers and traders moved to the African grazing land and provided loans to the poor African peasants to take native lands.In 1904, the Herero people, led by Samuel Maharero, and in 1905 the Nama people, led by Hendrik Witbooi, rebelled against German colonial rule. However,both uprisings were crushed by the Germans.\n 2.5.4 Resistances in North Africa\nAfter the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, Britain and France were engaged in a fierce struggle to influence Egypt. At the time, Egypt had a weak government, led by Khedive Ismael Pasha. In 1879, both Britain and France agreed to implement dual control over Egypt.

Sometimes they divided existing \ngroups of people.\n2.6.2 Economic impacts\nColonialism in Africa brought about the under-development of African territories in many different ways. Africa remained a supplier of raw materials for Europe. Africans were not allowed nor encouraged to go into manufacturing. The Europeans had introduced modern education but the introduction of colonial education made Africans abandon their indigenous technological skills and education. African natural resources were exploited by European colonizers. For instance, forests were cleared to get timber,  to provide firewood that was needed to power the steam engine trains and to construct rail tracks.\n2.6.3 Social impacts\nColonialism also disrupted the development and way of living of local communities. During the colonization process communities had to be moved and relocated to create white settlement areas for large scale farming.\nColonization also brought about different types of diseases. An example of such a disease \nthat was introduced by the settlers is Rinderpest disease which affected the livestock of the Shona people of present day Zimbabwe and Botswana, and North Ethiopia during the Kefu Qen .\nGenerally, colonialism shaped both the economic and political structure of African \ncolonies to serve the interest of European powers. There were some positive outcomes of colonialism, such as tribal warfares ended following the introduction of colonial administration, introduction of different modern ideas construction of railways, roads to transport raw materials to ports. \nGroup Work:\nWrite an essay on one of the following African countries: Kenya, Ghana, Algeria, \nAngola, South Africa, Rwanda, Senegal, and Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and make a short presentation in the class focusing on the following points.\n•\tLocation, Capital, Population, Language, Ethnic group, Religion\n•\tWhen did this country become under Europeans rule?\n•\tWhat social, economic and political changes were seen in this country after \ncolonization?\n"

The main market centres along these lines were Bonga, Hirmata, Saqa, Asandabo, Basso, and Gondar. \nAt Gondar it branched into two: the first went westward through Chilga to Matamma \n(Gallabat) and the other route passed through Adwa, Asmara and terminated at Massawa on the Red Sea coast.\nThe second major trade route also started from Bonga and passed through the famous \nmarket centres of the century like Hirmata in Jimma, Soddo in southern Shewa, Rogge at the foot of Yarar Mountain, Aliyu Amba or Abdul Rasul in northern Shewa and Harar in eastern Ethiopia. At Harar the route branched into two the first route went to Zeyila and the second to Berbera, both on the Somalia Coast of the Indian Ocean."

MTT was a coin introduced from Austria to the Horn of African region by Arab traders at the end of the eighteenth century.\nThe long-distance traders had diverse backgrounds. At each market centre, local \npeoples were active traders. However, Muslim merchants were the most dominant group that travelled from the interior to the coast. Among these were the northern Muslim merchants known as Jabarti and Southwestern Muslim Oromo merchants known as Afqala.

The Role of Cottage Industries\n•\tWhat is a cottage industry?Brainstorming\nThe Cottage industry and handicraft technology existed in Ethiopia since time \nimmemorial. The most common cottage industries were metalworking, pottery, tannery, carpentry, masonry, weaving, jewellery and basket making. The general public’s attitude towards artisans was not at all encouraging as they were mostly disdained and marginalized. Consequently, the locally produced agricultural implements and household furniture did not show any significant improvement and sophistication.\nAmong the cottage industries, blacksmiths were responsible for the manufacture of a \nwide variety of articles of considerable economic and military importance in many parts of the country. These included ploughshares and the iron parts of pick-axes, sickles and other agricultural implements, as well as knives and razors, spearheads, daggers, swords, bullets and spare parts for the rifles. \nMoreover, tent-pegs, hammers, pincers, drills, nails, hatchets, saws and files, steels for \nstriking fire, pans on which to cook bread, bits and stirrups for horses and mules, chains and rings were also manufactured by smiths.

Later, in \n1848, Kassa also fought against the Egyptians at a place called Dabarqi, where he was defeated because of the Egyptians’ superior military organization, discipline, and better armaments.\nMeanwhile, Kassa became popular and this attracted the attention of Yejju\n(Warra-Sheh) lords. Therefore, they decided to have Kassa on their side through a marriage arrangement and thus they gave him Tewabech, the daughter of Ras Ali II. He was also \nappointed as the governor of Quara. However, Kassa felt that he was not treated well by Ras Ali and his mother, Etege Menen. Hence he gradually fought against the Yejju nobles \nand other regional lords.\nThe major regional lords defeated by Kassa Hailu before his coronation were: Dejjach\nGoshu Zewde of Gojjam at Gur Amba on November 27, 1852; Birru Aligaz and the four \nother Dejjazmachs at Gorgora Bichegn on April 12, 1853; Ras Ali of Yejju Dynasty at \nAyshal on 29 June 1853; and Dejjazmach Wube of Semen and Tigray at Deresge on 8 \nFebruary 1855.\nOf the above battles, the battle of Ayshal where the last ruler of the Yejju dynasty was \ndefeated symbolized the end of Zemene Mesafint. Kassa Haylu was anointed by Abuna \nSalama at Deresge Mariam on 9 February 1855 and became Tewodros II, King of Kings"

He knew that his country would not remain independent unless some fundamental measures were taken. So, he envisioned establishing a country that was territorially united and militarily self-dependent and stronger. Immediately after his coronation, he set out to unify the country.\nThe Wallo campaign, where he encountered fierce resistance, started in March \n1855. The capture of Maqdala on 12 September 1855 marked the end of Tewodros’s campaign to Wallo for the time being. His campaign to Shewa also lasted some five months. It was concluded after the Shewan force was defeated at the Battle of Bereket in November 1855. Tewodros left Shewa by appointing Haile-Mikael, the brother of Haile-Melekot, the king of Shewa who died in the middle of the campaign. But Seifu, another brother of Haile Melekot, continued to challenge Tewodros’s authority. Similarly, in areas like Gojjam and Semen, rebellion against Tewodros had already started. Hence, the conclusion of the Shewan campaign marked the peak of Tewodros’s power and also the beginning of the end of his reign.\nThe other aspect of his reign was his attempt to modernize the country by \nintroducing drastic reforms in the areas of military, administration and socio-economy. In the military sphere, he introduced military titles like Yasr Aleqa (commander of ten), \nYamsa Aleka  (commander of the hundred), and Yeshi Aleqa (commander of the thousand). \nHe tried to organise and replace the regional armies of the Zemene-Mesafint (‘Era of \nPrinces’) with a salaried national army. He established an arms manufacture at Gafat (near Debre Tabor) with the help of European missionaries and artisans. As a result, about 35 cannons were produced at Gafat including his famous mortar known as “Sebastopol.”\nFigure 3.2   Tewodros’s mortar, Sebastopol"

However, Tewodros’s reforms and modernization attempts faced serious challenges and opposition from both inside and outside the country. \nInternally, his administrative and social reforms were opposed by the forces of \nregionalism, who wanted to maintain their indigenous power in their respective provinces.The clergy saw his involvement in the affairs of the church as dangerous to the church’s authority as an institution. \nExternally, the lack of support from foreign powers with that assistance he planned to \nmodernize the country brought him into conflict with the British. The combination of these two forces of opposition contributed to his eventual downfall.The British sent a very large army to Ethiopia to deal with the matter military after they failed to negotiate the release of the diplomatic mission and missionaries with Tewodros. The storming of Meqdela on April 30, 1868, by the British and the subsequent suicide of Tewodros brought an end to his reign.\nFigure 3.3   Emperor Tewodros II"

Compare and contrast Tewodros’s  campaigns to Wallo and Shewa.\nFollowing the death of Emperor Tewodros, three contenders to the throne emerged; \nnamely, Wagshum Gobeze of Lasta, Kassa Mircha of Tigray, and Menilek of Shewa. Gobeze came to power immediately after Tewodros as Emperor Tekle-Giorgis II (1868−71). Although attempts were made to create a smooth relationship between the Emperor and Kassa Mircha, the quest for state power put them in enmity and it was brought to an end following a battle at Assem (near Adwa) in July 1871 in which the latter became victorious.\nYohannes IV (1872-1889) attempted to introduce a decentralized system of \nadministration permitting regional rulers to exercise a great deal of autonomy. A typical example of this was his recognition of Menilek as Nigus of Shewa in 1878 by the Liche agreement. Similarly, Yohannes designated Ras Adal Tesema of Gojjam as \nNigus Tekle-Haymanot of Gojjam and Kafa in 1881. He succeeded in achieving the unity of the predominantly Christian provinces, including Wag and Lasta, Simen, Begemidr,  Amhara Saynt, Gojjam, Wallo, Shewa, and the Mereb Milash for quite some time.\nEmperor Yohannes IV sought to end the religious controversy within the Ethiopian \nOrthodox Tewahdo Church (EOTC) and presided over the Council of Boru Meda (1878), where Tewahdo was declared the only doctrine of the EOTC. Ethiopian Muslims, especially those of Wallo, were forced to be converted to Orthodox Christianity. \nHence, some superficially converted while others preferred migration to other areas like \nArsi, Gurage, Jimma and Sudan.  However, the Wallo leaders such as Mohammed Ali and Amede Liban were converted to Christianity and changed their names to Ras Mikael and Dejjach Hayle-Mariam, respectively."

The area south of the Abay River, particularly Horro Guduru was controlled by Ras Adal (Nigus Tekle-Haymanot) for some time up to the time   of his defeat at Embabo by Menilek’s commander, Ras Gobana. After \nthe Battle of Embabo, Leqa-Naqamte, Leqa-Qellem, and Jimma Abba Jifar submitted to Menilek peacefully, who promised them to recognize and maintain their autonomy.\nFigure 3.7   Abba Jifar II of Jimma\nHowever, in some of the Oromo inhabited territories like in Arsi and Hararghe Menilek encountered stiff resistance. For instance, it took him six different campaigns from 1882 to 1886 to pacify the Arsi Oromo. Finally, the Arsi resistance was suppressed by the forces of Ras Darge Sahla Sellasie at the battle of Azule on 6 September 1886.\nIn Haraghe, the combined forces of the Harari and the Oromo attempted to resist \nMenilek’s expansion.

A year before his coronation, the country was hit by the Great Famine or Kefu Qan (1888-92), which devastated the nation and seriously depleted the cattle population. The immediate cause of the famine was the rinderpest epidemic triggered by the Italian importation of infected cattle through Massawa. The famine partly necessitated and gave further momentum to territorial expansion in southern Ethiopia.

Emperor Tewodros’s modernization drive emanated mainly from the understanding of  this danger to Ethiopia. He needed the technical support of  Europe, particularly that of  Britain, both against what he considered to be the main threat to Ethiopia, namely Egypt, and to assist him in his goal of modernizing the country. As a result, in 1862, Tewodros sent a letter to Queen Victoria of Great Britain requesting military assistance through Consul Cameron. Cameron came back to Ethiopia via Egypt without any response.\nTewodros held Cameron directly responsible for the lack of response to his letter of 1862 to Queen Victoria of England. He also suspected him of conspiring with the “Turks”, i.e. the Egyptians, against him.  \nOn learning about the imprisonment of the Europeans, Queen Victoria sent a letter through Hormuzd RAssem, which did not satisfy Tewodros. After some communications, the British parliament decided to take military action."

However, the easy way in which the British accomplished their mission in Ethiopia created a false impression on the Egyptians about Ethiopia. So, they immediately showed a keen interest to occupy Northeast Africa, including Ethiopia, with the ambition of controlling the source of the Nile. After making initial encroachments along the Ethiopian side of the Red Sea, they prepared a very grand campaign to control the whole of the country. \nThat came in 1875, when Khedive Ismail Pasha, the Egyptian leader, sent his troops to \ninvade Ethiopia in three directions. First was the Zeila front led by Mohammed Rauf Pasha which resulted in the occupation of the Harar Emirate (1875 to 1885). The second front was led by Werner Munzinger, the architect of the whole of Ismail’s scheme for the invasion of Ethiopia, and started from the direction of Tajura (Djibouti) but was annihilated by the Afar.\nFinally, Colonel Arendrup and Arakel Bey led another 2,000 well-armed troops through \nMassawa. Emperor Yohannes IV and his general Ras Alula mobilized about 20,000 forces \nand  encountered the Egyptians at the Battle of Gundat (16 November 1875), in which the Egyptian troops were severely defeated. The Egyptians again reorganised their forces and sent army to invade Ethiopia. However, they were defeated at the Battle of Gura (7–9 March 1876).The other foreign and most dangerous power which came to challenge Ethiopian independence in the last quarter of the nineteenth century was Italy. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the Red Sea region had acquired great strategic and commercial importance. The Italian foothold on the Horn of Africa began when an Italian private shipping company (Rubatino) had bought the port of Assab from the local chiefs in 1869. The port was transferred to the Italian government in 1882. \nMoreover, Great Britain secretly transferred Massawa from Egypt to Italy in 1885. Using \nthese bases as a springboard, Italy began penetrating northern Ethiopia, Mereb Melash. But they were defeated decisively at the Battle of Dogali by Ras Alula Engida in 1887, \nEmperor Yohannes’s famous general and right-hand man.  \nThere was a parallel development in the northwestern part of the country bordering \nSudan. The struggle of the Sudanese people against Egyptian occupation had gathered momentum and drove them out of most of the country and encircled the remaining Egyptian troops in the Kassala area of Eastern Sudan. The only way the Egyptians could save their lives was via Massawa through the cooperation of Ethiopia. So, the British"

The Ethiopian involvement infuriated the Mahdists and became the main cause for the clashes between the Mahdists of Sudan and Ethiopian forces that lasted from 1885 to 1889. \nThe first clash between the two came at Kufit in September 1885, when the Ethiopian \nforces were victorious. However, when Emperor Yohannes IV was in northern Ethiopia busy with the task of checking the Italian advance to Marab Milash, the Mahdists caused a lot of destruction to churches and monasteries, including the killing of the clergy and the laity. In January 1887, Yohannes ordered Nigus Tekle-Haymanot of Gojjam to repulse the Mahdists.A year later, the Mahdists led by Abu Anja, defeated Nigus Tekle-Haimanot’s troops at Sar \nWuha in Dembia. At this important juncture, Nigus Menilek and Nigus Tekle-Haymanot conspired against the emperor, instead of directly facing the Mahdists. Now, Emperor Yohannes faced what is called the triangular tension, namely the Italians in the north, the Mahdists in the west and northwest, and his two vassals in the centre.  As a result,Emperor Yohannes made the following national call.\n የኢትዮጵያ ህዝብ ሆይ ኢትዮጵያ የተባለችዉ ሀገር: 1ኛ እናትህ ናት፤ 2ኛ ክብርህ \nናት፤ 3ኛ ሚስትህ ናት፤4ኛ ልጅህ ናት፤5ኛ መቃብርህ ናት። እንግዲህ የእናትን ፍቅር፣ የዘዉድን ክብር፣የሚስትን የዋህነት፣ የልጅን ደስታ፣ የመቃብርን ከባቲነት አስበህ ተነስ!\nLiterally, Oh!

Accordingly, rise understanding the love of a mother, honor of a crown, the goodness of a wife, the delight of having a child, and the shelter of a grave.  \nHence, on 9 March 1889, the Emperor marched to Metemma where he died fighting the \nMahdists. Internal divisions and hostilities among rulers would result in a huge cost to the country and its people.  Among others, Maqdala and Metemma are very good testimonies.\n•\tWhat do you know about the battle of Adwa?Brainstorming"

Following the death of Emperor Yohannes, the responsibility of keeping the territorial integrity of the country fell on his successor, Menilek II. The Italians used the treaty of Wuchale to advance their colonial interests. The treaty was signed by King Menilek II and, the Italian representative, Count Pietro Antonelli in the town of Wuchale, Ethiopia, on 2 May 1889 to promote friendship and trade between the two countries. There were slight, but crucial, differences between the Italian and the Amharic versions of the treaty which created misunderstandings between the two countries. Article XVII of the treaty in its Amharic version indicated that emperor of Ethiopia “could” use the good offices of the Italian government in his dealings with other foreign powers while the Italian text of the treaty made it obligatory. Upon failing to get the revision of the treaty from the Italians, Emperor Menilek unilaterally abrogated the treaty in 1893.\nTo achieve their intentions, the Italians crossed the Marab River, arrived at Adigrat, and \nproceeded to Amba-Alage. This Italians steady encroachment onto north Ethiopia and the need to defend the territorial integrity of the country has been  made clear by Emperor Menilek’s call for mobilization.\n አሁንም አገር የሚያጠፋ ሃይማኖት የሚለዉጥ ጠላት እግዚአብሔር የወሰነልንን \nየባህር በር አልፎ መጥቷልና …….እንደ ፍልፈል መሬት ይቆፍር ጀመር፡፡ አሁን ግን በእግዚአብሔር ረደትነት አገሬን አሳልፌ አልሰጠዉም፡፡… ጉልበት ያለህ በጉልበትህ እርዳኝ ፡፡ ጉልበት የሌለህ ለልጅህ ለምሽትህ ለሃይማኖትህ ስትል በሀዘን እርዳኝ፡፡\nEnemies have now come upon us to ruin the country and to change our religion by crossing the sea coast which God gave us as our frontier.

Today, you who are strong give me of your strength, and youwho are weak, help me by prayer.  \nFollowing Emperor Menilek’s proclamation for general mobilization, about 100,000 \ntroops from every part of the country gathered at Wara-Illu (in today’s South Wallo). The people marched to the front irrespective of gender, regional, and ethnic differences to fight against the Italian aggression. Almost troops from all parts of the country participated in the war.

The \nstrategy was commonly called the “siege of Mekelle” and was believed to be designed by Empress Taytu. After some negotiations, the besieged Italian troops were set free and left Mekele, and joined their compatriots at Adwa.\nFigure 3.13  Etege Taytu\nThe last and decisive phase of the war was fought at Adwa on March 1st 1896. The Ethiopian forces were led by Emperor Menilek, Empress Taytu and war generals like RasMikael, Ras Makonnen, Ras Alula, Ras Mangasha and Nigus Tekle-Haymanot. The result \nof this battle was a remarkable victory for Ethiopians. At this battle, about 8,000 Italian fighters were killed, 1,500 wounded, and 3,000 were captured. On the Ethiopian side, about 4,000-6,000 troops are said to have been killed.\nThe battle of Adwa has had a profound impact on the countries involved in the \nconflict and the people who were fighting for their independence and rights all over the world. As far as Ethiopia was concerned, its status as an independent sovereign state was recognized by the great powers of the world. The first country to do so was Italy itself. By the treaty of Addis Ababa signed on October 26, 1896, and which concluded the war, Italy recognized the independence of Ethiopia. Soon after, several powers of the time (including Italy, France, Britain, Russia, the United States, Germany, Belgium, Turkey, and others) also recognized Ethiopia as a sovereign state and opened their legations in Addis Ababa. In addition, the heroic national campaign, the cooperation, and common successes of the peoples of Ethiopia had a positive impact in consolidating national integration. The victory has since served as a symbol of unity, independence and national pride for all Ethiopians."

In 1909, he also named his grandson Lij Iyasu as his successor (regent). In the meanwhile, Empress Taytu's influence grew, but she faced stiff opposition from the Shewan nobles, who saw her as a significant danger to their dominion. They organised resistance against her, and she was forced to abstain from participating in the country's politics in 1910.Iyasu began to wield his full powers with the fall of Taytu and the death of Ras Tesema Nadaw, and his de facto rule lasted from 1911 until 1916. Iyyasu enhanced laws and regulations on the one hand, he announced a series of actions and policies that might be described as progressive and bold, yet contentious on the other.

His plans were thwarted when his soldiers were decisively defeated and he was captured by the Shewan army, led by Ras Teferi, at Sagale on October 27, 1916, in the deadliest battle since Adwa.\nPower was shared between Empress Zewditu, Menilek II's daughter, and Teferi \nMekonnen, son of the renowned Ras Mekonnen, following the successful palace revolt \nagainst Lij Iyyasu in 1916. The political settlement of 1916 marked the start of a difficult and unusual period of dual governance known as the time of diarchy. The time was characterized by an ongoing dispute between Empress Zewditu's adherents, known as the conservative or indigenous camp on the one hand, and the progressive prince Teferi Mekonnen and his supporters on the other. The conservative camp was led by Fitawrari\nHabte Giyorgis Dinagde.\nThe expulsion of the ministers in 1918, with the exception of Habte Gyorgis Dinagde, \nMinister of War from 1907 until 1926 was the first step towards enhancing Teferi’s power. Habte Gyorgis died peacefully in December 1926, putting an end to their silent struggle.\nNonetheless, there were several open challenges to the regent's expanding power. Dejjach\nBalcha Safo, governor of Sidamo, and Ras Gugsa Wale, governor of Begemdir and \nex-husband of Zewditu, issued an open challenge to Teferi. The conflicts were ended when Dejjach Balcha was removed from his governorship in 1928 and Ras Gugsa was \ndefeated at the Battle of Anchim in 1930."

After gaining virtual control of power, the emperor \nimplemented a series of reforms and adjustments aimed at setting the groundwork for autocratic rule.\nThe first written constitution of 1931 established the legal basis for emerging absolutism. \nThe Constitution provided a legal framework for Haile Selassie's emerging autocratic rule. The constitution recognized the emperor's unrestricted rights to make appointments and dismiss officials, administering justice, declare and end wars, and grant lands and honours.\nThe provincial hereditary aristocracy lost a lot of political influence with the 1931 \nConstitution. With the exception  of  Tigray, which was permitted to be ruled by descendants of its local hereditary chiefs, the country’s other provinces lost their internal autonomy and were replaced by individuals nominated directly by the Emperor. The formation of a national army was another measure through which the emperor attempted to consolidate his power. In 1930, the Belgian officers began training the Imperial Bodyguard. In 1934, the first officer training school was established at Holeta, west of the capital, by a Swedish military mission. The first batch of officers three year training program was disrupted by the Italian invasion. Rather than career officers, the cadets began to make history as passionate patriots.  "

With air attacks, his men advanced quickly into Tigrai. Three hundred planes were dispatched to drop the internationally banned poison gas on Ethiopians. General Rudolfo Graziani was in charge of the Italian army in the south.\n1.What was the pretext that the Italian used when they invaded Ethiopia \nin 1935?\nThe Ethiopian government's mobilization order was met with a huge response. \nEthiopia's counter-offensive, on the other hand, arrived more later than expected. The delay was caused by two factors. First and foremost, Ethiopia placed its faith in the League of Nations and the international world, hoping for fair justice. Second, Ethiopians intended to extend Italy's supply line by enabling it to move deeper into the country. Ethiopian soldiers eventually went out to fight the Italians on two fronts: the northern and southern fronts.\nRas Kassa Hailu had overall command of the northern front. Under him were Ras\nMulugeta Yeggezu (minister of war), Ras Seyoum Mengesha (ruler of Tigray), and \nRas Emeru Haile-Selassie (governor of Gojjam).

Their main task was to collect weapons, medicine, food, and intelligence reports to be secretly delivered to fighters. As Yewust Arbegnoch, Ethiopian women played an \nimportant role. Women used to get crucial information from Italians. Some went to the extent of arranging secret killings of Italian authorities. \nIn addition to underground activities, there were women that led their troops in battles of resistance. Others served as rallying points to soldiers, when their husbands died.

The major causes of the war are indicated as follows. (See also the video using this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGfAf45ddCo) .\nRoot Causes of WW I\nMutual Defense AlliancesGrowing rivalries and mutual mistrust had led to the creation of several military alliances among the Great Powers as early as the 1870s. This alliance system had been designed to keep peace in Europe but it would instead help push the continent into war.\nThe Major military alliances during WWI were:\n•\tTriple Alliance: The Triple Alliance (also known as Central Powers) when originally formed in 1882, Comprised Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy. Italy, however, left it and joined the Triple Entente in 1915.\n•\tTriple Entente:It developed from the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894 which was followed by the British and French Entente Cordiale of 1904. It was transformed into a Triple Entente following the Anglo-Russia Agreement of 1907. More than twenty countries, including the USA, Japan, the Union of South Africa, Portugal and Rumania joined the Triple Entente also named the Allied Powers.  4.1.The First World War: Causes, Course and the Consequence\nLearning outcomes of the lessonAt the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:\n•\tidentify the causes of the First World War;\n•\tassess the consequences of the First World War."

The nations of Europe competed fiercely for colonies in Africa and Asia. The quest for colonies sometimes pushed European nations to the brink of war. As European countries continued  to  compete for overseas empires, their rivalry and mistrust of one another deepened.MilitarismYet another troubling development throughout the early years of the 20\nth century \nwas the rise of a dangerous European arms race. By 1914, Germany had nearly 100 warships and two million trained soldiers. Great Britain and Germany both greatly increased their navies in this period. Further, in Germany and Russia particularly, the military establishment began to have a greater influence on public policy. This increase in militarism helped push the countries involved into war.\nNationalism\nNationalism also created tension between France and Germany. France wanted to avenge its defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 to 1871 and regain its lost provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. Balkan nationalism was another source of tension. They struggled to be independent of the Ottoman Turks domination."

Serbia accepted most of Austria-Hungary’s demands but sought international arbitration on some issues. Austria- Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, 1914. Within a week most of Europe was at war.\nFigure 4.2  Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife,Sophie (source: britannica.com)\nIn 1914 the Germans followed a plan devised by Count Alfred von Schlieffen, their Chief of the General Staff. Schlieffen proposed to attack France through Belgium and occupy Paris within six weeks before turning on Russia to avoid a drawn-out, two-front war. Then turn east against the Russia, a large and backward country which would be slow to mobilize. Moreover, Schlieffen also proposed that the Germans should attack the French from the north through Belgium, where the French defence was weak. Hence, in August 1914, Germany invaded France through Belgium. The Germans' attack was forced back at the Battle of the Marne in September 1914, which halted their advance. After that, both sides dug defensive trenches, and a deadly stalemate started on the Western Front, which lasted for the next four years.

The October 1917 Russian Revolution: Cause, Course and \n           Results\nLearning outcomes of the lesson\nAt the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:\n•\texplain the causes of the October 1917 Revolution in Russia;\n•\trecognise the difference between the February and October Revolutions in Russia; and\n•\tdistinguish the effects of the October Revolution.\nVarious other sectors of Russian society were discontented throughout the nineteenth century by the autocratic rule of the Czars. This gave rise to different political groups who worked in secret. Some liberal groups demanded the replacement of Czarist absolutism with a democratic parliamentary government. \nThe group called Social Revolutionaries thought that the peasants should rise, and seize \nthe land of all landlords. Such groups encouraged the peasants to rebel. Of all these, the most radical group was that of the Marxists. This group followed the teachings of Karl Marx (1818-1883). These revolutionaries formed the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1898. This party was later divided into the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The Bolsheviks (majority) were led by Lenin, whose real name was Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov.\nRussia was one of the poorest countries in Europe in the early 1900s. Much of \nWestern Europe saw Russia as a backward and underdeveloped society. The Russian Empire maintained serfdom, a kind of feudalism, in which landless peasants were forced to serve the land-owning nobility. Serfdom was abolished in Russia in 1861.  \nA population increase at the end of the nineteenth century, combined with a difficult \ngrowing season due to Russia's northern climate and a succession of costly conflicts, beginning with the Crimean War (1854-1856), resulted in recurrent food shortages across the vast empire. For instance, defeat by Japan during the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05)  became the immediate cause of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The defeat sparked a surge of domestic upheaval. \nThe Bloody Sunday massacre of peace demonstrators in St. Petersburg marked the \nbeginning of the violent phase of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The czar's army killed or injured hundreds of defenceless protestors. As a result,  Nicholas II was forced to issue the October Manifesto, which purportedly turned Russia from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy."

In August 1914, the Russian army invaded Germany’s province of East Prussia and occupied a significant portion of Austrian-controlled Galicia in support of the Serbs.\nGerman control of the Baltic Sea and German-Ottoman control of the Black \nSea severed Russia from most of its foreign supplies and potential markets.\nBy the middle of 1915, Russia was affected by the impact of the war at most. \nFood and fuel were in short supply, casualties were increasing, and inflation was mounting. Strikes rose among low-paid factory workers, and there were reports that peasants, who wanted reforms of land ownership, were restless. Heavy losses during the war also strengthened thoughts that Tsar Nicholas II was unfit to rule.\nThe February Revolution\nThe Russian army lost battle after battle in the ongoing First World War. The military losses precipitated the outbreak of the Revolution. Living conditions in the towns worsened due to food shortages and inflation. In Petrograd, workers went on strikes, and riots became common. Soldiers in Petrograd, finally, joined the people of the city.  Eventually, Czar Nicholas II was deposed and this brought the rule of the Romanov Dynasty to an end.\nAfter the monarchy was deposed in February 1917, the powerful members of the \nDuma (parliament)  formed a Provisional Government led by George Lvov, who was succeeded by Alexander Kerensky  However, the new government failed to meet the people's demands. It was unable to mitigate the food shortage and bring the war to an end.As a result, it lost support among the general public. \nMeanwhile, in Petrograd, peasants, workers, and soldiers united together to form Soviets \n(councils or co-coordinating bodies).

In the meantime, peasants, workers and soldiers in \nPetrograd came together and formed Soviets (councils or co-coordinating bodies). The Bolsheviks under Lenin, who had just returned from exile, demanded that the ineffective Provisional Government be dissolved.The Bolsheviks held the following popular slogans:“All Power to the Soviets!” and “Peace, Land and Bread!” with these slogans and their organizing skills, the Bolsheviks won popular support. In September 1917, a military take-over was attempted by General Kornilov, the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army. Following the failure of this attempt, the Bolsheviks strengthened their hold in Petrograd and Moscow where the Soviets were strong.\nThe February Revolution, in Petrograd, was a spontaneous \nprotest movement, involving huge masses of people. The event was characterized by massive strikes of workers and demonstrations, the use of the army and the police to stop demonstrations and the occupation of the State Duma in Petrograd. The period between February and October 1917 was characterized by a ‘dual power’ political structure, representing    the    Provisional    Government  and   the   Petrograd  Soviet.  \nGroup work:\n1.

They established a regime led by Premier Lenin and war Minister Leo Trotsky. Soon after they secured state power, the Bolsheviks took the following measures:\n•\tOrganised the workers to take over factories and nationalized industry. An eight hour working day was introduced by law.\n•\tDirected the peasant to seize the noble’s estates by the decree passed in October 1917. It confiscated the land of landlords and gave it to the peasants. This was an important measure meant to solve the age-old agrarian problem."

Russia formally withdrew from World War I, after signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in 1918.\nBy introducing these and other measures, the Bolsheviks tried to meet the demands of the People for “Peace, Land and Bread’’. These Bolshevik measures were disliked by those who lost their lands, and high offices in government. West European powers feared that such an upheaval would set a bad example for their people. The internal enemies of the Revolution, led by the ex-czarist officers’, organised military operations and attacked the revolutionary government. Their forces were known as the “White Armies”. A civil war broke out and lasted until 1922. The Red army of the revolutionary government succeeded in crushing the rebel forces and saved the revolution.\nTo solve the mounting economic problems, the Bolsheviks introduced the New \nEconomic Policy (NEP) in 1921. This policy restored smaller enterprises to their owners, allowed peasants to sell their grains for profit and revived commerce.\nA new state called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) was established \nin July 1922. Secret police called Cheka was also organised in the same year to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Lenin died in 1924 and was succeeded by Joseph Stalin. \nFrom1928-38, Stalin carried out purges within the Soviet communist party to \nstrengthen his totalitarian rule and eliminate opposition. He introduced series of economic plans, called ‘Five Year Economic Plans’. The first five-year economic plan lasted from 1928 to 1932. All foreign influence in Russian industry was abolished. Industrialization showed rapid progress resulting in a high rate of production. But the process of forceful collectivization of farms faced serious opposition, particularly from the rich farmers (kulaks), and as a result, Russia faced a severe food shortage in 1934.\nIn the Second Five Year Plan, however, the situation was somewhat alleviated. The third \nfive-year plan had just begun when Nazi Germany attacked Russia in 1941. By that time, Stalin had already transformed Russia from a backward agricultural nation into a modern industrial state. This economic strength enabled Russia to score a victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War.\nThe Russian Revolution became an inspiration for colonized peoples of Africa and \nAsia in their anti-colonial struggle. The strengthening of the U.S.S.R. after the Second World War changed the international balance of power. The U.S.S.R. became strong supporter of the national liberation struggle in Africa, Asia and Latin American countries."

It was the first international organization whose principal mission was  to maintain world peace. Its primary goals, as stated in its Covenant, included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration.\nThe idea of the formation of the League of Nations was proposed by President Woodrow \nWilson of the USA. But the U.S. Congress was resistant to joining the League, as doing so would legally bind the U.S. to intervene in European conflicts. In the end, the U.S. did not join the League.\nThe League was composed of a General Assembly, which included delegates from all \nmember states, a permanent secretariat that oversaw administrative functions, and an Executive Council, the membership of which was restricted to the great powers. The Council consisted of four permanent members (Great Britain, France, Japan, and Italy) and four non-permanent members. Members of the League of Nations were required to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all other nation-states and to renounce the use or threat of military force as a means of resolving international conflicts. The League sought to peacefully resolve territorial disputes between members and, was in some cases, highly effective. For instance, in 1926,   the League negotiated a peaceful outcome to the conflict between Iraq and Turkey over the province of Mosul. Similarly, in the early 1930s, it successfully mediated a resolution to the border dispute between Colombia and Peru.\nHowever, the League ultimately failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second World War \nand has therefore been viewed as a largely weak, ineffective, and essentially powerless organization. The League failed to intervene in many conflicts leading up to World War II, including the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the Spanish Civil War, and the Second Sino-Japanese War.Learning outcomes of the lessonAt the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:\n•\texplain the ideals that underpinned the forming of the League of Nations;\n•\tassess the successes and failures of the League of Nations."

A Fascist State was established in Italy in 1922. Nazis came into power in Germany in 1933. Benito Mussolini had formed his Fascist party in 1919. Nazi was a term associated with the members of the National Socialist German Worker’s Party of Adolf Hitler.\nItaly had joined the First World War (1914-18) with hopes and ambitions of having plenty \nafter the war for its poor peasants and workers. However, the war rendered Italy great illusions, disappointment and unemployment. The Peace Settlement of 1919, better known as the Treaty of Versailles, too turned out to be dissatisfactory to Italy. The defeat of Germany in the First World War had witnessed important developments such as the Treaty of Versailles, the continuation of the age-old rivalry between France and Germany; the emergence of the first communist state in Russia, and the economic depression in the 1930s.\nThese developments were directly or indirectly responsible for the rise of Fascism in \nItaly and Nazism in Germany. Fascism and Nazism, in turn, were primarily responsible for the commencement of the Second World War in 1939."

Italy had joined the Allies after the secret treaty of London of 1915. The Allies had agreed to give Italy certain areas like Eritrea and Trieste and later backed out. This gave a justification to Italy’s grievance against the Allies. Socio-economic conditions of Italy: There was terrible confusion in the political, \nsocial and economic life of Italy in 1919. The economic structure had collapsed due to war and natural resources were scarce. It was argued by the supporters of Fascism that Italy, under such terrible conditions, will be saved by the Fascist revolution.  Mussolini claimed that the post-war labour unrest and discontent in Italy were leading the country towards communism, and his Fascist party alone could save the society from the   danger of communism.False aspirations of Italians: The feeling of disappointment after the Peace Settlement of 1919 was fully exploited by Mussolini, who succeeded not only in uniting the people under his leadership but also in increasing his hold over Italy. The people had this feeling that their high ambitions, which could not be achieved under a democratic Italy, would be realized under Fascist Italy."

Fascist Grand Council was established as an apex body to make laws with Duce (leader) Strikes and lockouts were declared illegal to enhance agricultural and industrial productions. Almost all walks of Italy’s life were being controlled by the State.\nTerritorial Expansion: An increase in population and the need for raw \nmaterial make it imperative for Italy to have territorial expansion. Mussolini succeeded in \nexpanding Italian territories.\nAggressive Foreign Policy: Mussolini adopted an ambitious foreign policy and \npersuaded Yugoslavia to hand over the port of Fiume and acquired it in 1924. He \nestablished a protectorate over Albania in 1926 and subsequently annexed it in 1939. He also acquired some territory in East Africa and near Libya through negotiations with England and France.

The communists tried to achieve this end by revolutionary methods. The reactionary elements took advantage of the failure of the Weimar Republic (the government established in Germany after WWI) and stirred up hostile propaganda against the Socialists. In their bid to capture power they blamed the Socialists, \nSome Germans believed that the Jews, had conspired against Germany during the War \nof 1914-18. This propaganda became very effective for the millions of middle-class Germans, who were on the verge of becoming dissatisfied on account of the economic crisis. They began    to join the ranks of the National Socialists (The Nazis), who were backed by the landed aristocracy of Germany.  Adolf  Hitler, the leader of the National Socialists, tried to capture power in 1923 by coup d’état but failed. Hitler was arrested and jailed, and his party was dissolved. It was during this imprisonment that he wrote the Mein Kampf, his autobiography which was published in 1926.\nCauses of the Rise of Nazism\nThe following were the main causes of the rise of Nazism in Germany: (1) the war and the Peace Settlement left Germany disillusioned and crushed spiritually       and materially.(2) The continuing hostile attitude of France, the quarrels over the Ruhr, the Rhineland        occupation, the Saar, and the reparation it was made to pay. (3) the continuous debate on security and disarmament angered many Germans. (4) the Weimar Republic’s acceptance of unfair treaties and its inability to assert itself          more strongly in international affairs."

The Allied Powers consisted mainly of France, Britain, the U.S.A. (from December 1941) and the U.S.S.R. The Axis powers were made up of Germany, Japan and Italy (after June 1940).\nThe Second World War broke out in 1939. However, the roots of the international crisis \nwent back to the preceding two decades (1918-38). Generally, the causes of the war could be attributed to the following factors:-\nCauses of the War\nOne major cause for the war was the developments that led to the ascendancy of fascists in Germany, Italy and Japan. German Nazis complained that the Versailles Treaty signed at the end of the First World War was a dictated peace against Germany. They felt that Germany was unfairly treated by the terms of the peace treaty. Hence, the desire for the restoration of Germany’s old position in Europe derived the Nazis to revenge and aggression. Italy too, under the Fascist Party, subscribed to national chauvinism. Led by Benito Mussolini, Fascists aspired to build a great Italian empire in Africa. Militaristic Japan also planned to expand the Japanese Empire using conquests.\nFollowing World War I the World entered an international economic crisis known as \nGreat Depression. This crisis created economic troubles and political instabilities in many countries. In the wake of these problems, leaders like Adolf Hitler, Mussolini and Japan, military cliques promised a better future for their people and embarked on a policy of aggression.\nThe Western powers failed to create a united front against Fascist aggression. Rather \nBritain, and France followed the policy of appeasement. To avoid another world war they were prepared to allow territorial seizures by the aggressive Fascist states. The USA adopted a policy of isolation (not to ally with any power). But this rather encouraged the Fascist states to intensify their war of conquest on a global scale.\nIn 1931 Japan invaded Manchuria, a northern province of China. Japan continued to \ncontrol Manchuria and, when the League condemned her aggression, she withdrew from the League of Nations in May 1933. In 1937, Japan started the Sino-Japanese war"

Even more, Germany withdrew from the League in October 1933. Germany reoccupied the Rhineland in March 1936. Similarly, Fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia in October 1935. The Spanish Civil War (1936-39), in which Germany and Italy intervened, was another indicator of the aggressive move of the two powers. In 1936, the democratically elected republican government of Spain was overthrown by Spanish fascist leader, General Franco.\nIn March 1938 Adolf Hitler of Germany incorporated Austria under the pretext of \nuniting Austrian Germans with Germany. This simply was the realization of the age-long German dream of uniting Austria with Germany-Anschluss. Similarly, Hitler annexed parts of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 under the pretext of uniting the Sudeten Germans with Germany. In September 1938, Britain, France and Germany signed the Munich Deal. The Munich agreement allowed Germany to occupy part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by German-speaking Sudeten.\nThe Course of the War\nIn August 1939, Germany and the USSR signed the Nazi-Soviet Non-aggression Pact. Finally, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. This event marked the beginning of World War II. On 3 September 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany.Poland was not able to withstand German air and ground attacks. The whole of Poland had been overrun by the German army within three weeks. The Germans called their Polish campaign Blitzkrieg (lightning war). Germany annexed western Poland. The eastern provinces of Poland were invaded by Russia that had territorial claims over this country. From 1939 to 1940 Russia also annexed the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania as well as Finland, German expansion thus faced the competition of Russia. In the west, the German army invaded France in May 1940 through neutral Holland and Belgium. \nThe Nazi forces thus bypassed the Franco-German border with its mountainous terrain \nand French defensive fortification, the Maginot line. They easily defeated the Allied force in France. The British retreated to Dunkirk. The French resistance collapsed. The Germans occupied over half of France.\n In unoccupied France, the Nazis formed a puppet government headed by Marshal \nPetain, at Vichy, in southern France. General Charles de Gaulle formed a French Free government in England, and was determined to continue a war of liberation. Encouraged"

However, the \neffective British resistance repulsed the Nazi invasion.\nDespite the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact of 1939, the Nazis invaded Russia in \nJune 1941. Hitler expected a quick victory but Russia proved to be a strong enemy. The Russian armies retreated slowly and the communist guerrilla bands harassed the invaders. The Nazis occupied much territory but were unable to crush the Soviets' resistance.When Japan attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor on the Pacific Island of Hawaii in December 1941, the USA declared war on Japan. \nHowever, Japan secured the support of Italy and Germany. The last two, in turn, declared \nwar on the USA. The USA now joined the Second World War. To stop further expansion of Germany in the west, America began sending continuous supplies to Britain, the Soviet Union and other allies. The Allies also cooperated in the military operations of the Far East but America remained the major opponent of Japan in the Far Eastern war theatre.In 1942 Germany, Italy and Japan were at the height of their success. The Germans had conquered vast territories in Europe. The Japanese became masters of much of the Far East and Pacific Islands.\nIn Europe, the Soviet Union's implacable resistance turned back the tide of Nazi's\nassault. The victories scored at the Battles of Stalingrad in 1942/3 and Kursk in 1943, were decisive. These marked the beginning of the Allied counter-offensive in Europe.\nIn May 1943 Britain, France and the USA finally drove German and Italian forces out \nof North Africa. This was the second Allied military victory in Africa. The balance of power was shifting in favor of the Allies in the years 1943 to 1945. The Allies launched successful air and sea attacks on Axis Powers in Asia and Europe.  The  Alliled Powers opened a Second Front in Europe in 1944.\nThe 1943 Allied invasion of Italy hastened the overthrow of Mussolini from power. \nFrance was liberated in 1944. By June 1944, Allied forces had overrun much of Italy, though some heavy fighting continued till the end of the war. Russia liberated her last provinces in 1943 to 1944 and her troops continued their advance towards Germany. While the Western Allies were advancing into Germany, Russia entered Berlin. Adolf Hitler committed suicide on 30 April 1945.  Mussolini was murdered by the Italian communists in 1945. A few days later, Germany unconditionally surrendered. Thus the war came to an end in Europe.\nAllied forces, mainly the USA, New Zealand and Australia had already begun \nreoccupying the Pacific Islands in 1943. The Allies enjoyed naval, air and land"

On the 6th and 9th of August 1945, the \nUSA dropped atomic bombs on the two Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \nrespectively. US forces occupied Tokyo, the capital of Japan, on 2 September 1945. Japan unconditionally surrendered.\nWorld War II ended with victory for the Allied Powers. There were several reasons for \nthe defeat of the Axis Powers. To begin with, the Axis Powers had their forces stretched over vast territories, and they could not protect the vast territories which they controlled. When the Soviet Union and the USA entered the war, the military balance shifted in favour of the Allies. Nazi Germany and militarist Japan made the mistake of provoking these powers and forcing them to enter into the war. The coordinated military operations of the Allies together with their mighty economic resources and enormous manpower ensured their success.\nEffects of WWII\nThe Second World War had far-reaching consequences. Above all, it caused an immense loss in human and material wealth. About 50 million people, fighters and civilians lost their lives, millions of families were broken, children left orphans, and a significant number of fighters were to become handicapped. Material losses on infrastructures, factories, roads, buildings and others summed up to excel the destructions of the First World War.The war hastened the process of decolonization in Asia and Africa. Following the end of the war, the USA and USSR became super-powers of the world. The bloodless diplomatic and political competition and conflict between the two powers and their respective allies known as the Cold War-was another outcome of WWII.\nThe urge for the formation of a new international organization for the maintenance of \nworld peace and order gave birth to the United Nations Organization(UNO), which replaced the League of Nations."

However the major causes of WWI include, among others, nationalism, rivalry for empires and markets, an arms race, militarism, and alliance structures. The Two belligerent Military Blocks of World War I were the Triple Entente (Allied Powers) and the Triple Alliance (Central Powers).  \nThe leading members of the Allied Powers were France, Russia, and \nBritain.  The United States also fought on the side of the Allies after 1917. The chief members of the Central Powers were Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. WWI lasted until the defeat of the Central powers. The War destroyed empires, established several new nation-states, promoted independence movements in the European colonies, drove the United States to become a world power and led to the rise of communism in Russia and Hitler in Germany. \nThe League of Nations founded in 1919, sought to maintain peace, \ncollective security, and negotiation diplomacy to settle international issues and improve global welfare. However, the League was ultimately unable to stop Axis aggression in the 1930s, and hence failed to achieve its principal goal of preventing future global wars.\nIn the aftermath of World War I, Mussolini and Hitler rose to power, using the \npolitical and economic effects of the war as a pretext. Hitler opposed the Treaty of Versailles, which made Germany responsible for the outbreak of the war and imposed severe penalties on it, which include among others, abandoning its foreign territories, reducing the size of its army and navy, and paying reparations to the victors of WWI. Fascist leaders used their powers in more extreme ways both at home and abroad, which paved the way for the beginning of another World War known as WWII.  \nWWI was not limited to Europe. It had a devastating impact on the Middle East, \nAfrica, and Asia. The War also spurred desires for independence in many of the colonial empires that remained under the Europeans’ control.

There are currently 193 UN member states. The United Nations' mission and operations are driven by the goals and ideals outlined in its founding Charter. The predecessor of the United Nations was the League of Nations,  which existed from 1926 to 1946 and failed to achieve its most fundamental goal of preventing another global war. \nThe League of Nations had several weaknesses that finally led to its demise. Among \nthese, the first one was the inability of the world's most powerful governments, to join the League, most notably the United States. Second, during the 1930s, League members were hesitant to strongly denounce Japanese, Italian, and German aggression."

The western countries feared that the communists, led by the Soviet Union, were planning to take over Europe. \nThe Second World War resulted in the emergence of two superpowers: the USA \n(United States of America) and the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republic).The United States was sole superpower that possessed  atomic weapons at that time, after bombarding Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.

The United States strengthened its military and political influence in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, consolidating its status as a leading world power.\nThe Soviet Union economy was seriously affected by the war. The Soviet Union \nsuffered huge losses, including 20 million deaths and heavy damage to industry and agriculture during World War II. Joseph Stalin wanted to protect the USSR from further attack by establishing “satellite nations” that were sympathetic and allies to communism along its western borders.\nIn 1944 and 45, the Soviet Red Army liberated and occupied Poland, Romania, \nBulgaria and Hungary. The Soviets established a communist regime in these countries. In these Eastern European countries, the Allies desired free elections.

It was called the Cold War because there was large scale war  directly between the two nations. \nAs they were significantly stronger than any other country, these two countries are \ngenerally referred to be superpowers. The term” Cold war” became popular or got wider currency in April 1947 when journalist Walter Lippmann published a book on U.S.-Soviet tensions entitled The Cold War.\nThere are different interpretations about the causes of the Cold war. Western writers \nblamed Russia. They said Stalin was trying to build up a Soviet empire. Other historians blamed America, particularly President Truman as a cause for the Cold war.

When \nthe British government indicated that it would no longer be able to protect the eastern Mediterranean region, Western nations were concerned that Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East, with its vast oil reserves, might fall to communism.\nFigure 5.2   President H. Truman\nThe United States decided  to act. It issued what became known as the Truman Doctrine in March 1947. The United States was resolved to stop communism's spread. For this purpose, Truman said that the United States utilizes its money, supplies, and technological knowledge to assist countries threatened by communism. Truman requested $400 million in funding and other supplies from Congress to assist in the defense of Greece and Turkey against communist attack. In 1949, the Greek government suppressed the communist movement with American financial and technical assistance. Following that, the United States adopted a new strategy known as Containment to stop or slow the expansion of communism. George Kennan was the architect of the Containment Doctrine.\nThe Marshall Plan\nEurope was devastated by years of conflict during World War II. Millions of people had been killed or wounded.

Even though each power was in command of its own zone, the four powers aspired to administer Germany collaboratively and cooperatively. Despite its location in the heart of the Soviet Zone in Eastern Germany, Berlin was split into four parts. In January 1948, the United Kingdom and the United States united their two zones and named it Bizonia.  Later , the Trizonia\n(three zones) was created when the French zone merged into Bizonia in April 1949.\nThe Berlin Blockade, which lasted from 24 June 1948 to 12 May  1949, was one of the Cold War's first significant international crises. Stalin imposed the Berlin Blockade in June 1948, prohibiting food, resources, and supplies from reaching West Berlin. The large \"Berlin airlift,\" which supplied West Berlin with food and other supplies, was launched by the United States and numerous other nations in response. The Soviet Union lifted the blockade of West Berlin on May 12, 1949. The Berlin Blockade exposed postwar Europe's conflicting ideological and economic ambitions. One of the consequences of the Berlin blockade was the establishment of two German states. In August 1949, the western powers set up the German Federal Republic (FRG), known as West Germany.

The arms race is defined as a fast growth in the number or quality of military force instruments. The atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 sparked an arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. This event signalled the start of the Nuclear Age. However, the Soviet Union launched an atomic weapon in 1949, initiating the Cold War nuclear arms race. Both sides were competing to acquire more nuclear weapons than the other. They also attempted to create more powerful weaponry.\nIn the 1950s, tension grew between the two superpowers. The Americans worried about \nan advancing tide of communism following the success of the communist revolution in Asia. In 1949, Mao Tse Tung( Mao Zedong) established the Chinese communist government. In 1950, Communist North Korea invaded South Korea. There were strong communist movements in Vietnam. The arms race was intensified as both powers invested a huge amount of their budget in the production of armaments.\nArms Race timeline\n•\t1952- Americans exploded the Hydrogen bomb. 2500 times more powerful than the atomic bomb\n•\t1953- the Russian produced Hydrogen bomb\n•\t1953-55: This was a period of soft relations (Thaw) between the USA and Soviet Russia.

Moreover, it had displaced more productive forms of investment. For instance, the Soviet Union’s economic difficulties were certainly aggravated by the very high proportion of the gross domestic product devoted to arms. \nThe weapons race has an impact on poorer countries as well, because those \nemerging countries were victims of the debt issue as they imported more weaponry from manufacturers.

In 1915, with the hope of securing support against the Ottoman Empire, the British promised Palestine for the Arabs. But, in 1917 the British supported the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine in what was known as the Balfour Declaration. \nAfter WWI and the destruction of the Ottoman Empire, Britain and France \ndivided up the Middle East into mandates that they controlled directly. This included the territory of Palestine where British officials had supported growing Jewish migration from Europe. In the 1920s and 1930s, there was growing Jewish immigration into Palestine.  As a reaction against anti-Semitism in Europe, Zionism, a Jewish nationalist movement, grew in popularity. Zionists wanted to create a Jewish homeland.\nFigure 5.7   Theodor Herzl\nTheodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, encouraged Jews to move to Palestine and buy land with the ultimate goal of having enough land to establish a state.The demand for an independent Jewish state increased after the Holocaust.

This fierce conflict is called the “Cold War” since the two superpowers never directly engaged in combat (“ hot war”). \nInstead, they increased their military capabilities, tried to expand their global influence, and undermined the other’s way of life in the eyes of the world. While the United States believed in a capitalist system of free markets and multiple political parties, the Soviet Union was founded on a communist system controlled by a centralized state and a single political party.\nThe Cold War started in Europe. From 1945 to 1953, the USSR expanded its \ninfluence by creating the Eastern Bloc across states like Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Stalin set up puppet communist governments that he could control. He repressed anyone who resisted him. The United States likewise began to meddle in the affairs of foreign nations where it feared communist regimes would gain control. This became known as a policy of containment.\nThe cold war which initially started in Europe gradually spread to the Middle \nEast, Asia, and Latin America, with each side trying to establish control. The Cold War finally ended in the 1990s. The USSR could no longer be on a par with US military spending. \nMeanwhile, economic problems in the Eastern Bloc and growing opposition \nto Soviet domination had encouraged Eastern Europeans to revolt against communism. The new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, proposed reforms to stimulate communist economies.

The American Era\nEthiopian-American ties began in 1903 with the arrival of the first American mission \nto Ethiopia, led by Robert Skinner, but the connection grew stronger and more active following WWII. The Point Four Agreement was signed by the two countries on May 15, 1952. As a result, the United States assisted to Ethiopia in the areas of locust management, agricultural and public health education, public administration   training, and scholarship   awards    to    Ethiopian    students. In the 1950s,   American strategic interests in Ethiopia, the Horn of Africa, and the Middle East shifted dramatically. Following    the   Young  Free   Officers'   revolt   in    1952,  Egypt   adopted  a  pro-communist, anti-Israel administration. Colonel Gamal Abdel Nassir headed the movement. As a result, the US began looking for a new partner in the Middle East. The Ethiopian-American Treaty of 1953 was based on these developments. The 1953 deal let the US to operate the Kagnew station, acommunication facility in Asmara that had previously been used by the Italians as Radio Marina.\nIt was renamed Kagnew station after the name of the Ethiopian battalion that took \npart in the Korean War of 1950 -1953, on the side of the Americans. In return, the US government promised to provide military assistance to Ethiopia and set up a unit known as the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG). American influence was particularly strong in the fields of Military organization and training, communication, and education.In the 1960s and 70s, Ethio-US relations began to decline due to the following reasons:\n•\tAdvances in satellite communication significantly diminished the importance of the Kagnew station on which the Ethio-American alliance had been founded.\n•\tGrowing opposition, especially among students, against American Imperialism.\nThus, on the eve of the Ethiopian revolution of 1974, Haile Selassie’s regime began to lose the USA, which was its strong ally.\nExercise 6.2\nA.

His political vision mainly focused on the suppression of regional nobilities and the creation of a centralized state. To this end, Ethiopia was reorganised into twelve teqlaygezats  (governorate-generals) in 1942. Each province was subdivided into \nsub-provinces (awrajas), districts (weredas), and sub-districts (mikitil weredas). The head of each teqlaygezat  was appointed by the Emperor and was known as enderase (on my \nbehalf) who was to rule on behalf of the Emperor.\n6.1.3 The 1955 Constitution\nAnother important measure taken by Haile Selassie to consolidate his power was the revision of the Ethiopian constitution in 1955. The Emperor sought to provide a formal basis for his efforts at centralization and to attract the loyalty of educated Ethiopians. The other reason that necessitated the promulgation of the revised constitution of 1955 was the federation of Eritrea, which had an elected parliament and a more modern administration.\nThe Revised Constitution of 1955 strengthened the absolute power of the Emperor. Haile \nSelassie remained the head of the executive, the legislative and the judiciary organs of the government. The Revised Constitution of 1955 did not introduce constitutional principles like the popular sovereignty, rule of law, good governance, and religion-state relations. It focused on the centralization of governmental authority in the hands of the monarch rather than promoting the values of Ethiopians as culturally diverse people."

The majority of the societies in the rural areas are engaged mainly in subsistence agricultural activities. Agricultural commodities, such as coffee and oilseed, formed the bulk of the country’s exports. The country’s livestock population was the largest in Africa. During the Imperial period, the agricultural sector was particularly important not only for its large contribution to the economy but also because the land was the basis of power.The indigenous system of land tenure in Ethiopia were communal Gult and Rist. Gult\nreferred to the right to collect tributes (gibir) from peasants granted by the emperor to various ranks of the warrior class, local rulers, the church and others. Rist refers to land \nowned based on a lineage system.Although the qalad system or land measurement had a long history in Ethiopia, it is \nin conjunction with the creation of Menilek's empire-state that it came to have wider application. The motives behind land measurement were facilitating taxation.  The measured land was divided into lem, lem-tef and tef  ( fertile, semi fertile and unfertile, respectively). Land measurement  also promoted the twin processes of private ownership and land sale.  Lem land paid the highest and taf the lowest rate of tax. The \nqalad system also enabled the state to appropriate large areas of land either for its benefit or for individuals and institutions it wished to reward. The most important consequence of the growth of private tenure was the associated spread of tenancy (landlessness), especially in the Southern half, where some 50%-65% of all holdings were estimated to fall under this category. The post-Liberation period witnessed the acceleration of the privatization of land and the remarkable growth in land sales, particularly in the last decade and a half before the Revolution of 1974. Along with land measurement, large scale land sales and evictions became common. As a result of the feudal exploitation, most of the peasants became subsistence farmers living in miserable poverty during this period, especially in the southern half, where the tenancy system, locally known as Chisegna, was widespread. "

However, there were some improvements in communications, particularly in the area of road building.  Attempts were also made to establish a few small industries.In the post-liberation period, the country continued to be dependent on few agricultural products for export.

In 1954/55, the government created the National Economic Council to coordinate the state’s development plans. The First Five-Year Plan (1957-61) sought to develop a strong infrastructure, particularly in transportation, construction, and communications to link isolated regions. This plan aimed to accelerate agricultural development by promoting commercial agricultural ventures.\nThe Second Five-Year Plan (1962-67), signaled the beginning of a twenty-year program \nto transform Ethiopia’s predominantly agricultural economy to an agro-industrial one. Both the first and second plans focused on the intensification of agricultural development.The Third Five-Year Plan (1968-73) also sought to facilitate Ethiopia’s economic well-being by raising manufacturing and agro-industrial performance. But it focused on the development of the agricultural sector through package programs to address the rising problem of food shortages in Ethiopia.\nSeveral factors hindered the implementation of Ethiopia’s development planning during \nthe imperial period. These included a lack of administrative and technical capabilities to implement a national development plan. Many projects failed chiefly because of a shortage of qualified personnel, funds and equipment.\nBy the end of the plan period, the overall industrial base of the country remained weak \nand characterized by a rudimentary small scale that was mainly found in Asmara, Addis Ababa., and Dire Dawa.\nDuring Haile Selassie’s regime, the Ministry of Public Health  was founded in 1947, \nas well as referral hospitals in some provincial capitals, medical and health colleges in Addis Ababa and Gondar was also founded.

In doing so, the Ministry of Education and Fine Arts was established in 1942, and the effort to modernize education started all over the country again. Consequently, schools started growing in some of the urban centres of the country. From the time of liberation up to early 1950s, the  Ethiopian education system was highly influenced by the British.

The earliest noticeable revolt Emperor Haile Sellsie facedsoon after his return from exile  took place in Tigray and is known as the Woyyane revolt . In 1943, three \ndisgruntled social groups, namely, the semi pastoralists, highland peasants, and some local feudal lords formed a united front against the regime. \nThe revolt was led by Bilata Haile Mariam Reda. The feudal lords wanted a \ngreater share in the regional reallocation of power. The semi-pastoral communities of Southern Tigray especially the Raya and Azebo, felt that centralization posed a danger to their communal ideals of egalitarianism and justice. The highland cultivators  sought to prevent feudal exploitation and wanted to terminate the excessive demands of state officials and the militia. This was the most serious internal threat that Haile Selassie faced. It was finally crushed with the imperial force in collaboration with the British Royal Air force.\nThe revolt in Bale started in the district of Elkere in 1963 and ended in1970. By 1964, \nthe revolt was spread to the districts of Bale, like Wabe, Dallo, and Ganalle. One of the leaders of the  Bale uprising was Waqo Gutu.\nLand alienation, taxation, religious discrimination, ethnic hostility and corrupt \nadministrative practices that worsened peasant life sparked the peasant uprising  in Bale. The arrival of Christian settlers into a mostly Muslim area intensified religious tensions. The emerging Republic of Somalia, which vowed to construct “Greater Somalia”, provided crucial morale and material support to this campaign. However, the uprising  was finally quelled  after its popular leaders including Waqo surrendered in March 1970."

What finally triggered the Goijam uprising of 1968 was the Imperial government’s attempt to introduce the 1967 agricultural income tax. When the central government sent tax assessors to Gojjam, the peasants refused to allow them to enter their land and resisted the government agents.Then, they presented their petition to the state. In the absence of a positive response from the state, the peasants defied the authority of the state and rebelled. \nThe government reacted by sending a combined force of local militia and the armed police \nto the rebellious districts, especially of Mota , Qolla Dega Damot, and Bichena districts.

The coup was organised by the two brothers, Mengistu Neway and Germame Neway. Menegistu was then the commander of the Imperial Bodyguard. He was aided by his younger brother Germame, a civil servant and an intellectual, who represented a bridge between the pre Italo-Ethiopian War   intellectuals and the student radicals of   the 1960s and 1970s. The two brothers were joined by the Chief of Security, Colonel Warqenah Gabayahu, the Police Commissioner, Brigadier General Tsege Dibu and a few educated radicals.

The nucleus of the student movement was the University College of Addis Ababa (founded in 1950), later named Haile Selassie I University. Many students were displeased with the ruling monarchy, the feudal land structure, and the poor quality of life of the people. They also demanded improvement in education facilities and services. They began to demand a free press and the right to form their union.Although the undemocratic rule of the Haile Selassie government system was the main reason for the student movement, other additional factors strengthened their activism and radicalism. These include: \n•\tEthiopian student’s activism abroad, \n•\tthe attempted coup of 1960, \n•\tthe anti-imperialist and pro-socialist movement in some Western countries, and\n•\tthe presence of students from different African countries through Ethiopian government scholarships.\nOne of the major social and political issues that the students raised in the mid-1960s was the abolishment of the feudal land tenure system which was thought to have affected agricultural productivity. The famous slogan of the students was “Meret  Learashu”, “Land to the Tiller”. In addition, the students were advocating Marxism-Leninism as the right and appropriate ideology.\nOn December 28, 1969,  the president of the student union,  Tilahun Gizaw,   was \nshot while walking outside the  Seddest kilo campus in the Afencho Ber area, by the security police. Tilahun Gizaw’s death was a transformative event that pushed more radical student activists towards revolution."

The teachers were accompanied by students and some parents. On the same day, taxi drivers went on strike in protest against the 50% rise in petrol prices.

The conflict between the two countries briefly escalated into a border war in January 1964. \nThe major reason for the war was the political agitation of the new republic of Somalia \nthat was committed to bringing all Somali speaking territories under one five-pointed star in the Somalia flag. Each point represents one of the five Somali speaking territories of South Somalia, North Somalia, French Somaliland (now the Republic of Djibouti), the Ogaden region of Ethiopia, and the Northern Frontier District (NFD) of Kenya. In the end, following the peacemaking intervention of the OAU, both countries went back to where they started- no change of boundaries.\nIn 1977, Ethiopia and Somalia again entered into a serious conflict over the Ogaden \nregion. The war was initiated by President Siad  Barre of Somalia, who pursued his irredentist policy of achieving the creation of “Greater Somalia”. In the course of the war, Ethiopia was supported by the Soviet Union, Cuba, and the Democratic Republic of Yemen, while Somalia got military aid and technical support from the USA and the Arab world.\nThe full-scale invasion of the Somalia forces was successfully repulsed by a bold \ncounter offensive of the Ethiopian people. Following the invasion of Somalia,  Derg\nmobilized  hundreds of thousands of militia forces. \nThe war had far-reaching political, economic, and social implications for both \ncountries. In Somalia, it brought a massive influx of refugees from the north which, in turn, worsened the land and property rights of the local people. In Ethiopia, the victory encouraged Mengistu’s government to focus on fighting the northern opposition forces."

The federation of Eritrea with Ethiopia in 1952 was the compromised solution recommended in 1950 by the United Nations General Assembly, Eritrea was given legislative, executive, and judicial power to govern its domestic affairs, while the defence, foreign affairs, currency and finance, interstate commerce, and communications became the responsibility of the Ethiopian government.\nThe subsequent introduction of measures that were contrary to the Federal Act of 1952, \nwhich thoroughly undermined the autonomy of Eritrea created discontent among some Eritreans against the Ethiopian government.\nThe discontent finally led to the establishment of a movement known as the Eritrean \nLiberation Movement (ELM) in 1958. In 1960, in the meantime, a rival organization, Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) was formed in Cairo dedicated to launching an armed resistance. However, there was also tension in the different units of the ELF.\nIn 1973, the Eritrean People’s Liberation Forces (EPLF,) also known as Shabia which \nmeans popular in Arabic was founded.The year 1977 marked the peak of the anti Derg\nopposition.

The coordinated military offensives of the EPLF (Eritrean People Liberation Front) and the  the TPLF (Tigrean People’s Liberation Front) greatly weakened the government forces and forced them to lose battles after battles.\nThe Fall of the Derg\nSeveral factors led to the fall of the military regime. The famine of 1984/5, which was preceded by drought and crop failure, forced the military government to introduce a program of forced mass resettlement from drought-affected regions of Tigray and Wallo. Thus the people were resettled in the south and southwestern Ethiopia. However, this resulted in a massive internal displacement  problem due to ineffective organization. In addition to the economic and political crisis, the forceful resettlement, collectivization, and villagization programs contributed to the downfall of the régime.\nIn the last years of the 1980s, the EPLF joined with the TPLF forces that occupied most of \nnorthern Ethiopia. In the southern regions like Bale, and Hararghe, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and the Somali Abo Liberation Front (SALF), were active as of 1975. The Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF) was also active in the Ogaden region.In the second half of the 1980s, Soviet Russia and other Eastern European countries, who were struggling with their internal problems, had gradually withdrawn their economic and military assistance to the Derg. In 1991, the EPLF and EPRDF (Ethiopian People’s \nRevolutionary Democratic Front) forces launched a highly successful operation in their respective areas and secured military victories that resulted in the collapse of the military regime.\nExercise 6.5\nWrites short answer for the following question. \n1.What were the internal and external factors for the decline of the Derg regime?"

As of 1960, however, the regime had encountered implacable  opposition from students, peasants, and the military.In February 1974, the Ethiopian revolution erupted and resulted in regime change. The spontaneous nature of the movement enabled the military, which maintained a certain level of organization, to assume power. The new government led by the Derg adopted Marxism-Leninism as its official ideology \nand took upon itself the task of building a socialist state in Ethiopia.The Derg did not respect human and democratic rights and finally faced \nvarious forms of opposition from different sections  of the population. The Eritrean People’s Liberation Front ( EPLF), the Tigray People Liberation Front(TPLF), and the Oromo Liberation Front(OLF) and others opposed and engaged an armed struggle to overthrow the Derg. \nThe famine of 1984/5, which was preceded by drought and crop failure changed the peasant life from bad to worse. The resettlement and villagization programs launched by Derg were not effective and lacked proper coordination. In the meantime, the Derg failed to stop the guerilla movements of the various liberation forces and the continuity of the civil war left the country impoverished.   In addition to these internal factors, the changes in Soviet Russia resulted in the loss of vital military support and aid from the eastern bloc. Finally, the front made up of the TPLF, the EPDM (Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement, the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO), and the Ethiopian Democratic Officer’s Revolutionary Movement (EDORM), known as EPRDF (the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front) controlled Addis Ababa on May 28, 1991, that brought the end of the Derg regime.Unit Summary"

Soon after the end of WWI, the delegation of Egyptian nationalist activists led by Saad Zaghlul requested the British High Commissioner to end the British Protectorate in Egypt and Sudan. The request was accompanied by demonstrations and strikes across Egypt by students, elite, civil servants, merchants, peasants, workers, and religious leaders. As a result of the popular uprising, London was compelled to issue a unilateral declaration of Egyptian independence on February 22, 1922. Some decades after Egyptian independence, the Kingdom of Libya achieved its independence from Italy under UN Trusteeship (British administration) on December 24, 1951.\nFollowing the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which overthrew the unpopular \ngovernment of King Farouk, demand for the withdrawal of British forces from all of Egypt and Sudan was intensified. Muhammad Naguib, one of the two co-leaders of the revolution along with Gamal Abdel Nasser and Egypt’s first President made securing Sudanese independence a priority of the revolutionary government. On 1 January 1956,  Anglo-Egyptian Condominium over Sudan duly ended, and Sudan became independent.\nThe liberation of French colonies in North Africa began in the 1950s. French military \ndefeat in Indo-China in 1954 gave an impetus for the peoples of North Africa to wage a liberation war to end French colonial rule. For instance, the Moroccan National Front led by Sultan Mohammed V had  already started challenging French colonial domination. In 1953, the Riff and Atlas communities revolted and started the armed struggle."

In Algeria, \nthere had been a relatively larger number of white settlers. These white settlers were determined to prevent the independence of Algeria. They formed the “Secret Armed Organization” to hold back Algerian independence. The Algerian nationalist organization the “National Liberation Front of Algeria” (FLN) led by Ahmed Ben Bella waged a bitter guerrilla war of liberation against the French colonial domination from 1954 to 1962. Finally, based on an agreement reached between the Algerian freedom fighters and the French government, a referendum was conducted. The people of Algeria overwhelmingly voted for independence.

The key to the explanation of these unique features of the anti-colonial struggle in Portuguese Africa lies in the principles and practices of Portuguese colonialism as well as the nationalist movements that emerged.\nPortugal, like France, from the very beginning, considered its colonies not as colonies but \nrather as overseas provinces of Portugal. The Portuguese maintained the policy of keeping their empire intact by any means."

In 1962, Uganda attained independence from Britain as a single entity under the prime ministership of Milton Obote, it did so under a coalition government between the royalist Kabaka Yekka movement and the Uganda Peoples’ Congress (UPC) of Milton Obote.\nThe British trust territory of Tanganyika won its independence in 1961 under the \nTanganyika African National Union (TANU) led by Julius Nyerere.

In January 1959, riots broke out in Leopoldville  (now Kinshasa)  after a rally was held calling for the independence of the Congo.Violent clashes between Belgian forces and the Congolese also occurred later that year. Belgium, which previously maintained that independence for the Congo would not be possible in the immediate future, suddenly capitulated and began making arrangements for the Congo’s independence.\nIn May 1960, Patrice Lumumba’s MNC (Congo National Movement) Party won the \nparliamentary elections. The party appointed Lumumba as Prime Minister and elected Joseph Kasavubu, of the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO) party as the president. The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960, named the Republic of the Congo. Shortly after independence, the provinces of Katanga led by Moise Tshombe and South Kasai engaged in secessionist struggles against the new leadership.\nOn 5 September 1960, Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba from office. Lumumba declared \nKasavubu’s action unconstitutional. A crisis between the two leaders developed. On 17 January 1961, Katangan forces and Belgian Paratroopers supported by the United States and Belgium, kidnapped and executed Patrice Lumumba.

National Liberation Movement in Southern Africa\nSouthern Africa was dominated by Great Britain, who colonized Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Northern Rhodesia ( Zambia), Nyasaland ( Malawi), Bechuanaland (Botswana), Basutoland ( Lesotho) and South Africa. South Africa, in turn, after the First World War came to occupy Southwest Africa ( Namibia), the German Colony, in the name of the League of Nations. The other colonial power that had colonies in Southern Africa was Portugal, which dominated Angola and Mozambique.\nThe dominant theme of Southern African history of the 1960s and 1970s was the \nrevolutionary tide of liberation movements and the armed struggle in the settler colonies of South Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique, Angola and Namibia.\nKenneth Kaunda was the head of the Zambia African National Congress and its successor, \nthe United National Independence Party (UNIP. In 1962, the UNIP organised a massive campaign of civil disobedience against British rule. Early in 1964, an election based on universal adult suffrage gave UNIP a decisive majority, and it was supported by nearly a third of the white voters. On October 24 the country became the independent Republic of Zambia, within the Commonwealth and with Kaunda serving as executive president.Similarly, Nyasaland became independent in 1964 as Malawi with Hastings Kamuzu Banda as its president. In 1966, Basutoland (now Lesotho) and Bechuanaland (renamed Botswana) became independent. The British island colonies of Mauritius and Seychelles became independent in 1968 and 1976, respectively.\nSouth Rhodesia’s Road to independence also had its challenges. In 1965 the racist \nwhite settlers under the leadership of Ian Smith declared what was called the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). This step delayed majority rule in that country. Black Africans and the British government rejected this one-sided declaration of independence.

A long and bitter war was fought by the Zimbabwe African National Union \n(ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU) led by Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, respectively. This bitter struggle brought the white minority rule to an end.  A majority rule was established in April 1980. Robert Mugabe became the first Prime Minister and South Rhodesia adopted the name Zimbabwe.\nBy the Versailles Peace Treaty, at the end of World War I, South West Africa \n(present-day Namibia) was taken away from Germany and put under the Republic of South African mandatory rule. After the Second World War, the responsibility of looking after the mandate territories was transferred to the United Nations, (UN Trust Territories). In such a way, Spanish Guinea gained independence in 1968 and was renamed Equatorial Guinea. But South-West Africa entered into a long and bitter war against the Republic of South Africa. The struggle was organised and led by the “South-West African People’s Organization” (SWAPO). International diplomatic pressures were also put on South Africa. Finally, South-West Africa won its independence in 1990 and renamed Namibia.\n7.1.5. Apartheid in South Africa\n•\tWhat is Apartheid?Brainstorming\nTwo years after South Africa was freed from British rule in 1910, the African National Congress (ANC) was formed in 1912, aimed at struggling for the rights of the black population. Later, the ANC crystallized its demands into a call for “One man, one vote.”In 1948, a general election brought the Afrikaner National Party to power. It was a party made up of extreme racist groups. It promoted a policy of discrimination, which came to be known as apartheid. Apartheid means separate development of the races and white domination of the majority blacks by the minority whites. Apartheid denied all political rights to blacks and other non-whites. Under Apartheid eighty-seven per cent of all land in South Africa was reserved for whites.\nAdded to this, the racist Nationalist party cancelled all the nominal rights the blacks used \nto have. It passed several laws that deprived Africans of their political and human rights and imposed rigid segregation in sports, recreational areas, schools, hospitals, buses etc.In reaction to such repressive acts, widespread demonstrations and riots were held many times. In 1952 the ANC, led by Albert Luthuli, Oliver Tambo, Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu waged a campaign of passive resistance to the various discriminatory rules."

On 21 March 1960, police fired \non a peaceful and unarmed demonstrator at Sharpeville. 72 people were killed and some 186, including women and children, were wounded. The incident is remembered as the Sharpeville massacre. The act aroused worldwide condemnation. Many nations enacted economic sanctions against the racist government of South Africa. The racist government arrested the opposition leaders, including Nelson Mandela and banned all-black political organizations as illegal. Mandela was in jail at Robben Island until he was released in 1990.\nFigure 7.2  Sharpeville Massacre and Apartheid, (source: nikotina72.blogspot.com; \nglobalblackhistory.com)\nThe struggle of the ANC finally bore fruit. Apartheid was abolished and “one man one vote” was introduced in South Africa. In April 1994, Mandela won the election and held office as the first democratically elected president of the Republic of South Africa. He was able to reconcile blacks and whites in peace. In 1999, he left the presidency for the next democratically elected president, who happened to be his second in command in the ANC.

Its major failing was its inability to bring peace, prosperity, security,  and stability to Africa. Its powers were too weak and its influence inadequate to deal with the internal and external conflicts, poor governance, human rights abuses, poverty, and underdevelopment from which much of Africa suffered.

There was a modest recovery in the second half of the 1990s, but not enough to translate into meaningful increases in per capita incomes or reduction in poverty. The GDP growth has barely kept pace with the high rate of population growth. Achieving and maintaining reasonable real growth rates thus remains a major challenge for sub-Saharan Africa.\nTwo of the principal factors adversely affecting African developments in the 1980s \nand 1990s have been international debt and drought. At the root of the problem are the continuing adverse terms of trade. Since the 1960s, Africa’s raw material exports have dropped in price ten or twenty times compared to manufactured imports. Running out of foreign exchange, governments have had to turn to the IMF for emergency foreign exchange and for further loans to help pay the interest on loans that were already too large for them to pay off. The trouble is that the IMF and its associate, the World Bank, are financed by the banks of the developed capitalist economies of Western Europe and the USA. Their priorities reflected the interests of the capitalist west, which still regarded Africa primarily as the source of raw materials for its developed industries.\nRegional Economic Communities (RECs) are established in different regions of Africa. \nThe purpose of the RECs is to facilitate regional economic integration between members of the individual regions and through the wider African Economic Community (AEC), which was established under the Abuja Treaty (1991). The 1980 Lagos Plan of Action for the Development of Africa and the Abuja Treaty proposed the creation of RECs as the basis for wider African integration, with a view to regional and eventual continental integration. The RECs are increasingly involved in coordinating AU Member States’ interests in wider areas such as peace and security, development and governance."

They are coming to terms with post-colonial challenges ranging from contested boundaries, ethnicity, corruption, nepotism to client-patron relations. The  so-called “colonial hangover” is deeply embedded. France, for instance, has always maintained strong ties with its former colonies in sub-Saharan Africa, aimed at sustaining its neo-colonial grip in these countries\nMost of the newly independent African countries share peoples, who belong to the same \nethnic groups. This has led some African states to try to redraw colonial boundaries following ethnic settlements. As a result, Africa has seen frequent border conflicts.\nEthnic oppression and conflicts within African states have bred civil wars. At the root of \nthe ethnic conflicts have been political, economic and social injustices. Therefore, Africa is a continent that has been continually plagued by the effects of ethnic conflict from the conflict between the southern Igbo and the northern Hausa in the Biafra War to the ethnic cleansings in Darfur and Rwanda, Africa has suffered tremendously as a result of ethnic discord. The Biafra War, also known as the Nigerian Civil War, is an educative example when studying African ethnic conflict. The Biafra War began shortly after Nigeria gained "

The distribution of wealth was unequal, as the Igbo people of the southeast region had greater prosperity due to palm oil and petroleum resources). In contrast to the Hausa, who occupied the north and Yoruba who occupied the southwest, the south-eastern Igbo were geographically isolated. As a result of their decentralized location, wealth, and religion, the Igbo people were marginalized and labelled as outsiders. As a result of the 1966 military coup, Nigeria was thrown into a bloody civil war, and the Hausa-controlled government mobilized drastic measures to eliminate the Igbo population, which had chosen to secede and form the nation of Biafra.\nSimilarly, the African country of Rwanda has a long history of ethnic conflict. The most \nhorrific display of violence occurred from April to July of 1994, between two of Rwanda’s ethnic groups: the Tutsi and the Hutu. The Rwandan Genocide, as it came to be known, was one of the bloodiest ethnic conflicts in history. The attempted extermination of the Tutsi by the Hutu people resulted in 800,000 deaths, the majority being Tutsi.\nFor further information listen to the following documentary produced by the BBC about \nthe Rwandan genocide titled: “How could the Rwandan genocide happen? - BBC Africa.”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVnOGsJY5RQ.\nPoverty was another problem that Africans faced during the post-colonial period. Extreme \npoverty in Africa has many reasons, some of which are closely linked. The key causes of poverty in Africa and the suffering of millions of people include:\nGrowth of Population\nPopulation growth on the African continent is rapid, despite numerous prevention and education campaigns. Developmental success and economic growth cannot keep pace with this. In other words, first of all, rapid population growth is likely to reduce per capita income growth and well-being, which tends to increase poverty. Second, in densely populated poor nations with pressure on land, rapid population growth increases landlessness and hence the incidence of poverty. Finally, the adverse effects of rapid population growth on child health, and possibly on education, will likely increase poverty in the next generation.\nWar and Crises\nOf the world’s 20 war-related conflicts in 2013, 11 alone were fought on the African continent-all in sub-Saharan Africa. This includes the wars in Sudan and South Sudan,"

In crisis regions, agricultural production usually comes to a standstill. Many people flee, are forcibly expelled from their homes and are dependent on outside help. Poverty in Africa is increasing as a result of these wars.\nClimatic Conditions\nThe African continent has been suffering more and more from climate change in recent decades: devastating floods and extraordinary drought periods lead to crop failures. The consequences are regular hunger crises and famine in Africa. Particularly affected are East Africa and the Sahel region.\nDiseases\nDiseases such as AIDS, malaria and Ebola are the cause but also the result of poverty in Africa. A low level of education and inadequate medical care in many regions means that diseases spread faster and cannot be treated. The average life expectancy of the population is decreasing and the number of orphans is increasing. Loss of labour is particularly noticeable in agriculture and leads to reduced food production.\nInadequate agricultural infrastructure\nIn many regions of Africa, agriculture lacks both infrastructure and expertise such as roads, wells, irrigation systems, storage facilities, and agricultural machinery. That’s why local self-help is so important in helping to fight poverty in Africa.\nDespite negative impressions about Africa as the arena of dictators and despots, there \nare glimmers of hope and optimism. The past two decades have no doubt seen a steady expansion of the frontiers of liberal democracy in Africa. In Africa, for instance, by the 1990s profound democratic reforms had swept across the entire continent, including South Africa where the white-settler apartheid system collapsed in favour of multi-party democracy. From Algeria to DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) and from Benin to Kenya, democratic reforms led to the collapse of decades of single-party dictatorships and military rule. Africa’s democratic wave of the 1990s and 2000s has been termed “second independence”, reminiscent of the anti-colonial struggles of the 1950 and 60s, which led to the end of European colonial projects in Africa."

The Marxist military junta was toppled by a coalition of ethno-nationalist forces, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Front (EPRDF), dominated by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). Other members of the EPRDF were the Ethiopian Peoples’ Democratic Movement (EPDM), the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO) and the Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (SEPDM) which joined the coalition in 1992.The May 1991, London Conference was sponsored by the United States of America and attended by the Ethiopian government headed by Tesfaye Dinka, the EPLF under Isaias Afwerki, the EPRDF under TPLF leader Meles Zenawi, and the OLF under its deputy secretary-general, Lencho Letta. The United States Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, Herman Cohen, served as a mediator. The conference was supposed to explore ways to set up a transitional government in Addis Ababa. However, it was soon overtaken by events on the ground and Addis Ababa was occupied by the insurgents on May 28, 1991.As a result of the occupation of Addis Ababa by the insurgents, talks with government representatives broke down almost immediately, leaving the Eritrean and Tigray rebel leadership to plan the next step with Herman Cohen. A national conference was convened two months later in Addis Ababa to prepare for the transitional phase. An agreement to hold a referendum on independence in Eritrea in two years had been agreed already.The Ethiopian Democratic and Peaceful Transitional Conference convened in the first week of July 1991. The conferencewas held in accord with agreements reached by the leaders of EPDRF, EPLF, and OLF at the United State borkered peace talks held in London. The number of seats occupied by each group varied according to the size of the ethnic group it represented. Chaired by Meles Zenawi, the meeting followed the agenda prepared by its sponsors. For instance, Herman Cohen, who chaired the meeting in London, announced that the EPRDF would lead an interim government in Addis"

The ‘nationality issue’ figured prominently in it, and a heated discussion took place on the issue of secession.\nThe de facto acceptance of Eritrean secession implied in the provision for a referendum on \nthe issue limited to Eritreans passed with only one vote against and four abstentions. The \nEPLF sweetened the pill by offering Assab for the use of Ethiopia as a free port.The reorganizing of the Ethiopian state as a federation on an ethnic basis by giving nationalities the right to ‘administer their affairs within their own defined territory’ was passed with a minimum of reflection. Whether the participants realized the importance of the issue is open to debate.\nThe new government included an 87-member Council of Representatives and a \nNational Charter that functioned as a transitional constitution. There were 32 political groups represented in the Council of Representatives, but EPRDF-allied groups held 32 of the 87 seats. The TGE included a 17-member, ethnically mixed Council of Ministers. The OLF held four ministerial positions. The Council of Representatives elected Meles Zenawi as chairman of the Council of Representatives and president of Ethiopia.\nDespite the participation of various political and ethnic groups in the TGE, violent \nclashes occurred throughout many parts of Ethiopia. This instability had resulted mainly from the dominance of the EPRDF and its allies in the TGE. Nearly a year after the formation of  TGE,  the OLF withdrew from the government. In March 1993, the TGE expelled members of the Southern Ethiopia Peoples’ Democratic Coalition. Despite these developments, President Meles pledged to oversee the formation of multiparty democracy. In June 1994, there were elections for a 547-member Constituent Assembly that adopted the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.Moreover, the Transitional Charter also established 14 “self-governing regions” of “nations, nationalities, and peoples\". Thus from 1991 to 1995, Ethiopia was gradually evolving into a federal system of government.\n1.What were the major problems of the Transitional Period, and how were \nthey solved?\n2.Identify major political parties that participated in the conference \ndrafting of the 1991 Transitional Charter.\n"

Ethiopia has been viewed by many commentators as “ethnic” or “ethnical” federalism, perhaps as a result of the ethno linguistic nature of the basis of state formation. The 1995 Federal Constitution was a compact document with a notable degree of clarity and simplicity.  It is a document of 106 articles contained in eleven chapters. Principles of rule of law, self-determination, popular (or ethnic) sovereignty, inter-ethnic and inter-religious equality and gender equality are high in the list of priorities.\nMoreover, the principles of constitutional supremacy, respect for fundamental rights and \nfreedoms, secularism, and accountability and transparency of government are stipulated as the basic principles of the constitution.\nThe principle of sanctity of human rights and freedoms is further elaborated by the \nincorporation of a host of rights in 31 articles (Articles 13-44). Classical civil liberties of individual rights and economic and socio-cultural rights are all recognized. Right to peace, development and environment, too, are granted constitutional recognition. \nGroup rights (or collective rights as they are also known) are stressed. Thus the right \nof ethno national communities to self-determination (political, cultural, as well as economic) is rather gratuitously recognized. Ethno-national communities in Ethiopia not only have the right to promote their cultures, develop their languages, preserve their identity and history, they also have the right to “a full measure of self-governance” and even the right to secede from the Ethiopian polity (Article 39).\nThe federal constitution established a parliamentary system of government with the  House  \nof Peoples’ Representatives (HPR) as the supreme political organ in the country. The HPR is a legislature whose members are elected for a term of five years.\n As such, it is the institution that enjoys the decisional, control and representative powers \nof legislatures elsewhere. The Upper House, called the House of Federation (HoF), is a representative body whose members are representatives of each “Nation, Nationality, and People”. Its main task is constitutional interpretation (Article 62).\nThe constitution also recognized the establishment of an independent judiciary with the \nFederal Supreme Court at the top of a three-tier judicial hierarchy. Although the courts are free to decide overall justiciable cases including those in which constitutional rights of citizens stand tall, they have an equivocal position about the power to interpret the constitution as the ultimate interpretive power is explicitly given to the HoF."

Harari .Although the states have an ethnic configuration, none of them is homogeneous. Some are even extremely heterogeneous. The SNNPRS, having around 56 different groups, is so diverse and complex that one is prompted to think of a form of “federation within a federation”. Benishangul/Gumuz and Gambella have 4-5 ethnic groups within their territory. Afar, Somali, and Oromia, which to many observers seem to be homogeneous, also have considerable numbers of and even pockets of non-Afar, non-Somali, and non-Oromo in their territory. Tigray, another state viewed as entirely homogeneous by many, is also a composite of the dominant Tigray, the Erob and the Kunama. The Amhara State has the Agaw, the Oromo and other minorities in addition to the dominant Amhara. The Harari State has a large number of Oromo inhabitants, there by necessitating the formation of a coalition government at the state level. In this way, Ethiopia’s constitution-makers have tried, or so they claimed, to forge a type of multi-ethnic federation.In terms of the size of the member states, Oromia State accounts for one-third of the country’s total landmass, whereas the Harari State is by far the smallest at only 340 square kilometers. While the State of Somali, the State of Amhara and the State of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples are also large, the rest of the member states are smaller, signifying the asymmetric nature of the Ethiopian federation. Likewise, the ethnic composition of the federation reveals that together the Oromos and Amharas constitute around 70 per cent. Amharic was chosen as the working language at the federal level, although all languages are declared equal. States have the liberty to choose their working languages within their territory. Thus Tigray has chosen Tigrigna; Oromia has chosen Afaan Oromo; Somali has chosen Somali; Harari has chosen Harari, Afaan Oromo and Amharic. Afar has chosen Amharic until its own Afar language has developed in its script form to effectively meet the needs of the bureaucracy.

From its source to Lake Tana, it bears the name Gilgel Abay meaning smaller Abay and is fed by many smaller tributaries. The Blue Nile joins the White Nile in Khartoum. It contributes about 86% of the annual volume of water to the Nile.\nTekeze River originates from the Siemen Mountains, north-east of Lake Tana, and flows \nto Sudan bordering Ethiopia and Eritrea. After entering Sudan around Gallabat, Tekeze bears the name Atbara, and flows to Lekahshim al-Gibran Dam. Atbara passes through the valley 290kms north of Khartoum. From January to June, the size of the river decreases greatly and disappears in the deserts of Sudan before reaching the Nile.\nMap 8.1  The Nile Basin Countries, (source: science.org)"

Egypt has utilized more water than all other riparian states altogether. The better utilization of the Nile in Egypt is borne out of the necessity that life in the country and settled agriculture are dependent on it. That is the reason why life and agricultural activities in Egypt are completely confined to the Nile valley and its Delta. \nOn the contrary, although Ethiopia contributes about 86 per cent of the water of the Nile, \nand its catchment areas occupy more than 60 per cent of the total area of the country, it utilizes less than 1 per cent of the Nile up until recent times.The agreements signed in the twentieth century, both during and after the colonial period reserved the whole waters of the Nile for the lower riparian counties of Egypt and to some extent Sudan. The first important agreement was the 1929 Agreement between Great Britain, on behalf of the Sudan, and Egypt. \nThe agreement gave Egypt the right to veto any project on the Nile that could adversely \naffect its interests. Nevertheless, the agreement could not have any binding effect since it did not include any of the upper riparian states of the Nile.\nThis agreement was challenged by Sudan soon after its independence. The Sudanese \nargued that the agreement was no longer valid because it was signed by Britain and Egypt without consulting with them and had discriminated against Sudan by granting it only 4-billion-meter cubic water of the Nile. Thus, Egypt and Sudan signed the 1959 agreement after three consecutive years (1956-1958) of deadlock or no-peace no-war kind of relationship that has been created along their common boundaries.\nThe 1959 Agreement granted Egypt 55.5 billion cubic meters per annum while \nSudan’s share increased to 18.5 billion cubic meters. Therefore, the 1959 Agreement was a watershed in the hydro-political history of the Nile valley, it strengthened a monopoly on the waters of the Nile by Egypt and Sudan.\nThe agreement ignored the natural and legal rights of the remaining riparian states to the \nbounty of the Nile water resources and left no room whatsoever for the other co-basin countries, including Ethiopia, which contributes 86 percent of the total annual flow of the Nile.\nFollowing the coming of the EPRDF to power, attempts were made to resolve \ndifferences in the use of the Nile waters between Ethiopia and Egypt. As a result, an agreement known as Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) was signed between the two countries, Ethiopia represented by Meles Zenawi and Egypt by Hosni Mubarak. It was an agreement for general cooperation in the utilization of the Nile waters corresponding to"

It was only a talk to further talk on the Nile water question, which \ncan neither be considered as a treaty or an agreement nor even a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).\nIt mentioned neither the 1959 Agreement nor the principle of ‘fair and equitable \nutilization of the Nile waters, which Ethiopia has all along been calling for. Instead, the ‘no harm principle’ that protects the interests of Egypt was mentioned in the accord. Even then, however, the then President of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi, reiterated in the meeting that the status quo concerning the Nile cannot be maintained indefinitely.\nThe most important agreement signed so far is what is known as the Nile Basin \nInitiatives (NBI). It was a plan signed between the Nile riparian states, represented by their ministers of water development,  in Dar es Salaam (Tanzania). For the first time in the Basin’s history, an all-inclusive basin-wide institution was established, on 22\nnd February 1999, \nto provide a forum for consultation and coordination among the Basin states for the sustainable management and development of the shared Nile Basin water and related resources for win-win benefits.\nAs indicated above, the agreements signed so far did not recognize the interests of the \nupper riparian states regarding the Nile water. As a result, some Nile riparian countries have asserted their development ambitions on the river over the last two decades and pushed for a new agreement to enshrine equitable rights and harmonious use of the water.One such country is Ethiopia. As a result, Ethiopia has embarked on the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in the Benishangul-Gumuz region of Ethiopia on the Abay River. \nConstruction of the Grand Renaissance Dam started in April 2011 and is a central part of \nEthiopia’s ambitions for economic prosperity. It is largely self-financed and will have a capacity of 74 billion Cubic meters when completed, enough to provide abundant cheap energy to power both national and regional developments. Currently, more than half of Ethiopia’s 110 million people do not have access to electricity, but demand is increasing by 30 per cent annually."

In 1992, immediately after assuming power, the new Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) adopted a free-market economic model as the guiding principle- a clear departure from the socialist economic model pursued under the previous regime for over a decade. \nSeveral reform measures were introduced that aimed to improve the conditions \nof the war-ravaged economy. Among these, the Agricultural-led Development of Industrialization (ALDI) strategy was adopted to try and industrialize the predominantly agrarian economy of the country. The rationale was that by improving    the productivity of the agricultural sector transformation to an industrialized economy could be achieved. \nThe reasoning was that inducing a surplus in the agricultural sector would stimulate \nconsumerism and create the foundational demand for industrial growth.\nThe country’s economy has grown steadily from the baseline of 0.5% per annum from \n1981 to 1991 to 5.1% per annum from 1992 to 2004 to impressive levels of around 10.9% per annum from 2005 to 2015. These growth rates are some of the fastest, in the world, for a non-oil producing country.\nEthiopia has also made significant improvements to its internal infrastructure and in its \nability to attract foreign investment. Two good examples of infrastructure development are expansions made to the nation’s road network and the construction of the ‘Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. The road network has grown from 18,000Km in 1991 to over 120, 000Km nowadays-a significant increase of 70% over 25 years.\nDespite the steady economic growth in the 1990s, followed by rapid, sustained, growth\nbetween 2004/5 to 2015, and a concurrent improvement in socio-economic conditions, the country remains one of the poorest in the world. About 25 million people, around a quarter of the population, still live below the poverty line (living on less than 1.25 dollars. Every year, before and after the economic boom of 2005, between 5 and 18 million Ethiopians have had to depend on food aid. Levels of food insecurity massively increased in 2015 when one of the country’s worst droughts occurred.\nMoreover, the development of the infrastructure and the economic growth registered \nare characterized by the lack of fair distribution among the regional states and the concentration of wealth among the few rich.The FDRE constitution itself is still contested for its content and how it came about.

The period from the promulgation of the constitution to the present day has unfortunately been marred by recurrent political upheavals, particularly in the aftermath of certain political events such as elections.\nThe constitution, supposed to protect the rights of the citizens, was grossly \nviolated by the government. These were outbreaks of ethnic-based clashes in different parts of the country instigated by groups affiliated with the governing bodies and the imprisonments of leaders of the opposition and human rights activists. Though there was some attempt to allow a degree of freedom of expression, it was severely curtailed.\nThe path of the five regional and national elections held in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 \nand 2015 reveal the country’s uncomfortable political road. The ruling party, though it expressly declared its commitment to the establishment of multi-party democracy, preventing the appearance    or existence of a strong opposition party. Those who were able to survive were targets of harassment at times of election. As a result, the first two elections were largely boycotted by the opposition, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the political process and the EPRDF as a ruling party.\nThe EPRDF, therefore, won the first two elections without facing many serious \nchallenges. In the third election (2005), the opposition forces regrouped and seriously participated. The initial optimism surrounding the election, which most observers saw as a genuine multiparty exercise, was soon replaced by disappointment as the ruling EPRDF and the major opposition alliances, the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD) and the Union of Ethiopian Democratic Forces(UEDF), declared themselves the winners before all the votes had even been counted.\nHowever, the opposition did make significant gains in the country’s urban areas and some \nregions (Oromia, Amhara and the Southern Nations and Nationalities) winning up to 173 out of the 547 seats.In the capital, Addis Ababa, the opposition won all the Federal parliamentary seats as well   as those of the city administration council. The controversy surrounding the election process sparked violent protests that claimed the lives of more than 200 protesters. Furthermore, members of the CUD coalition refused to take up their seats in parliament and consequently, its leaders ended up in jail. Journalists and some civil society leaders were also imprisoned alongside CUD leaders."

In Ethiopia, indigenous conflict resolution is one of the most popular techniques of conflict settlement. \nLocal leaders, chiefs, religious leaders, healers, and elders lead the process of \nresolving problems using indigenous techniques. These authorities are respected for their extensive understanding of local customs, traditions, history, and contending parties' relationships. They have a wealth of conflict resolution expertise, and their ability to understand symbols of reconciliation, as well as their oratory abilities and social capital as community leaders, enable them to negotiate a settlement to the issue.\nThe indigenous dispute resolution mechanism is an informal way of resolving conflicts. \nIndigenous or informal dispute resolution mechanisms are old collections of techniques found in all communities. They resolve conflicts through arbitration and mediation. The main aim of this mechanism is to come up with a solution based on the recognized customs and morality of the society. This mechanism helps to restore a good relationship among the conflicting parties.\n In every corner of the country, there are age-old, culturally deep-rooted mechanisms of \nconflict resolution.

Gadaa is the indigenous \ndemocratic system of governance of the Oromo. In the Gadaa system, the people are \ngrouped and organied into five Gadaa classes that succeed each other every eight years in \nassuming economic, political, military and social responsibilities. The foundation of \nthe Gadaa system is rooted in the informal or customary Oromo institutions of aadaa\n(custom or tradition), seera (laws), safuu (a moral category that prescribes what \nhuman actions and behaviors ought to be). It is the Oromo concept of Ethics) and heera\n(justice). These institutions form indigenous systems of   knowledge and include the rules and regulations that determine access to natural resources. They are also conflict-resolution institutions uniquely placed to assist in tackling the interlinked problems of the environment, welfare, and conflict.\nIn most Ethiopian traditions, community elders are key decision-makers and conflict \nmediators. The other important informal institution of conflict resolution is the institution of araara (reconciliation). The process of reconciliation between conflicting individuals or groups by a group of Jaarsaas is jaarsummaa. Individuals or groups who are involved in the conflict are more likely to accept guidance from these mediators than from other sources because elders' decision is highly respected and supported by society.\nThe term jaarsa is the Oromo version of elder, and jaarsummaa is the process of \nreconciliation between conflicting individuals or groups of jaarsaas (elders). The \ndecision of the elders emphasizes the need for cooperation and a win-win solution instead of unconstructive competition among the disputants, resulting in a win-lose situation. The following Oromo proverb describes why a win-win is desired: “Akka Haroon hin gognee akka raachi hin dune ” (for the lake not to dry, for the frogs not to die)."

It is administered by an age grade system where each grade rotates every 8 years. There are five rotating age grades in the Luwa system: Darara, Fullassa, Hirobora, \nWawassa and Mogissa. The Luwa system has two important objectives. The first and the most important one is the \nrecruitment and training of the able bodied men for the defence of the nation. The second objective is the development of potential elders who will have authorities to replace the current elders (Cimeeyye).\nThe cyclical feature of the luwa system means that all males progress from a youth \nstatus of providing service to senior positions of redistributing wealth and knowledge. The youth learn skills by attending council meetings where elders make decisions. Hence, elders have a direct influence on the youth, who constitute the productive forces and the basis of wealth creation.\nThere were also other independent socio economic institutions which reflect a unique and \negalitarian culture of the Sidama society. Among such institutions the most notable one is Seera. \nThe Sidama Seera system is divided into two: the first refers to the broad \nconcept of Seera as a social constitution which governs the Sidama social life based on the Sidama moral code of halale (the ultimate truth). The Sidama moral code halale, provides the basis for distinguishing \"good\" and \"evil\" and in the broadest sense the term refers to ´the true way of life.´"

Heritage might be understood to be a physical ‘object’: a piece of property, a building or a place that can be ‘owned’ and ‘passed on’ to someone else.\nBesides these physical objects and places of heritage, there are also a variety of \nheritage practices that are preserved or passed down from generation to generation. Language, culture, popular song, literature, and dress, for example, are just as significant in helping us comprehend who we are as the physical artifacts and buildings that we are more accustomed to thinking of as 'heritage.'\nThe term ‘heritage values’ refers to the meanings and values that individuals or groups \nof people bestow on heritage (including buildings, archaeological sites, landscapes and intangible expressions of culture, such as traditions). There are many classifications of values, including historical, aesthetic, economic, social, scientific and an array of other types. \n9.2.2.
