The first is basic historical methodology \nand historiography, which helps you understand the nature of history as an academic disci -\npline. Every discipline has its own methodology, which is also true for history. Methodology refers to the sum total of rules, principles, procedures and techniques applied or followed in acquiring new knowledge or transforming the old one in a given discipline. The other focus area the unit addresses is the current scientific knowledge on human origins, including the evolution of early human cultures. \n     Learning Outcomes: After learning this unit, you will be able to:\n Ê identify the main reasons why history is studied as an academic discipline;\n Ê describe some of the key elements in studying history;\n Ê show the major centers of human evolution on a map of the world;\n Ê analyze the specific features of each stage of human evolution.\n Ê appreciate the use of historiography in studying history. \nKey Terms and Concepts\n  Historiography                \n  Change and continuity   \n  Primary sources                                                     \n1.1.

In another sense, history is \nan organized and critical study of the past based on interpretation of evidences. The study of history covers the period called pre-history as well. This was the period before the be-ginning of the technique of writing about 4000 B.C. The term history itself comes from the Greek word “istoria” (historia) which means inquiry or knowledge acquired by investigation. Brainstorming Questions\n\tCan you tell us the importance of learning history as a discipline?\n\tCan you tell us primary historical evidences which are found in your locality?\nAs an academic discipline, history refers to the study of past events, present situation and prediction of the future relating to social, economic, technological and political develop -\nments. It also deals with change and continuity of historical developments over time, and the patterns of cause and effect that determine change and continuity. History is often part of the learning area of social sciences, but with its own achievement objectives. In studying the human past historians usually attempt to answer questions such as what happened? When did it happen? How did it happen? Why did it happen? And what consequences did it have?\nHistory helps us to learn from the best achievements of people in the past. By learning \nabout their deeds, we also try not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Since history enables us to understand the past society, we will be able to increase our understanding of the present society and may forecast the future society. History is also important for establish -\ning identity of families, social groups, institutions, and countries. The study of history also provides skills that are essential for our intellectual growth. This is to mean that the rigor -\nous selection and examination of evidence so as to arrive at conclusions is an important training of the mind. Thus, learning history enables students to analyze and solve problems. It enables students to understand the crucial issues (problems) confronting human society, and to give an informed, reasoned, and intelligent response to these problems.  \nHowever, just as it is useful to humanity, history can also be abused. Selection is made from \nthe past to justify the present. Judging the past from the perspectives (values) of the present is a serious problem in many countries including Ethiopia. This is wrong and does not give us an objective picture of the past.1.1.1. History as an Academic Discipline"

Natural sciences study the phe -\nnomena of the physical world, while history studies human beings and human societies \nin the past. History does not conduct controlled experiments that are common in natural sciences. Natural scientists report the results of their findings in a neutral way. However, historians commonly make value judgments or put their personal views together with the result of their findings.  On the other hand, both scientist and historians are concerned with discovery, shading light on new knowledge, and solving current problems of society. Both of them also use systematic methods involving rigorous checks, use of evidence, and drawing conclusions. Therefore, history is a science because it must be proved by the use of reliable sources. It has a methodology which is followed by all historians. \nScholars also commonly categorize history under the social sciences, such as anthropolo-\ngy, sociology, psychology, economics and so on.  Historians examine every aspect of the lives of human beings including economic and social conditions, and the development of religion, art and other elements of culture. But still, there are differences between historians and social scientists. Unlike historians, social scientists use experimental data in the form of samples. In addition, social scientists far more regularly use theoretical models and hy -\npothesis than do historians. \n1.1.2. Historiography\nHistoriography refers to the history of historical writing. It is also a discipline dealing with the methods of writing history including the techniques of historical research and docu-mentation. History as a functional social activity stretches back to the beginning of human society. But the organized and systematic study of the past emerged largely with the rise of civilization particularly with the beginning of the technique of writing. For instance, the beginning of western (European) historical tradition is often associated with the ancient Greek historian named Herodotus (ca. 484-425 B.C). He wrote a long account, “Histories”, of the wars between the Greeks and the Persians. Herodotus is generally regarded as the “father of history”. His most famous successor was   Thucydides (ca. 455 – 400 B.C) who chronologically, critically and accurately wrote about the war between Athens and Sparta known as the Peloponnesian War (ca. 43 1-408 B.C).  \nAs time went on, the content and quality of history writing improved.

Ranke is generally considered to be the “father of modern historiography”. \nActivity 1.1 .\n1. What is the term istoria?\n2. Who is often considered as “the father of history”?\n3. What are change and continuity?\n4. In what way history be abused?\nWhat are the Key Elements in the Study of History?\nModern historical study involves a number of key elements of history. Sources are one of \nthe decisive key elements in historical study. No one can write history without sources. In history every statement must be supported by evidence. This evidence (historical informa -\ntion) is obtained from sources of history. The other key element in historical study is the interpretation of historical evidences. Before we start writing history, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the originality and meaning of our evidences. Otherwise, there is the possibility of misrepresentation or wrong interpretation of historical evidences. \nAfter a clear understanding of historical evidences, the next step is the presentation of \nthe facts on paper or writing history. The quality of historical writing is highly affected by the manner of presentation. In the past, the role of historical evidence was denied due consideration because no one bothered to support historical statements made by sources. Instead, the artistic value of romantic historical writing was very much emphasized and his -\ntory writing was taken just like the writing of fiction. But this academic attitude has already been rejected, particularly since the beginning of the 19\nth century, infavour of presenting \nhistorical information based on evidence in a simple, readable and attractive way. \nAnother key element in the study of history is objectivity or writing unbiased or undistorted \nhistory. The lessons of the past are valued only if they are based on truth; that is, accu -\nrate history. Objectivity involves not only identifying the real or significant facts based on reliable primary sources but also presenting what all the facts say without any bias for or against. However, no history can be entirely objective. This is why histories are constantly being rewritten. Nevertheless, it is the utmost duty of the historian to present the reality as they really were and in the way they really occurred. Only history that tells the truth as accurately as possible can guide us accurately to avoid pitfalls in the future."

Historical \nmethods comprise the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to conduct research and then write histories in the form of accounts of the past. Writing history also refers to practicing history. In this regard, it must be clear that nowadays, the rapid development in information and communication technology as well as digital imaging techniques do have a great deal of influence on the methods and tech -\nniques of writing history. The major steps in writing history include collection of historical information (evidence), source criticism, interpretation and writing objectively.  \nEthiopian Historiography\nEthiopia is one of the countries in the world that have indigenous tradition of historical writing since the 1 4\nth century, which continued up to the early 20th century almost un-\ninterruptedly. A series of chroniclers wrote almost exclusively about the achievements of Ethiopian emperors.  Hagiographers also made their own contributions to the development of the recorded history of the country. However, both hagiographies and chronicles have their own limitations. Hence, historians and students of history should be very careful and critical in using them to write history. \nIn Europe, Ethiopian studies were founded in the last quarter of the 17\nth century by a Ger-\nman historian named Job Ludolf (1624-1704). Ludolf also wrote the first modern history \nof Ethiopia, which was published in 1684. After the middle of the 19th century several other \nEuropeans took part in Ethiopian studies. Ethiopian history writers also appeared towards the end of the 19\nth century.\nUntil the early 1960s, Ethiopian studies focused mainly on the northern part of the country. It was the establishment of the Institute of Ethiopian Studies (IES) in 1963 at the then Haile Sellassie I University that changed this pattern. \nUntil then, Ethiopian studies focused on the north because the northern part of the country \nhad the following advantages over the south:\na) The north had a written language that served to keep records. \nb) Ancient Greek, Roman and Arab writers had left important information about \nthe region. \nc) Several sources on the Christian kingdom are also available in the Egyptian Coptic church archives. \nd) The north provided archaeological sources for the study of the history of the \nregion."

Few Europeans attempted to penetrate the southern part of the country since the middle of the 19\nth century. However, the scanty information left by them is barely enough to \nreconstruct the history of the peoples and states of the region. Moreover, by then, the south had no written language and so had not kept records of its past. Therefore, compared to the north, in the south there was lack of sources of history. Besides, scholars had been reluctant to collect and use oral traditions as reliable historical sources until the 1960s because the methodology for the scientific utilization of oral evidence had not yet been established. \nIn this regard, one of the problems of Ethiopian studies was the imbalance of sources. Very \nfew scholars were interested in the southern part of the country, while many writers were attracted to the north, where one could get a variety of sources. Lack of comprehensiveness was another feature of Ethiopian historiography of the period including the north. This was because most studies focused on the political history of the country. Although we have studies in economic history, there are none in social and cultural history. \nAnother problem in the study of Ethiopian history is the lack of objectivity in the sources \nthemselves, like, for instance, the chronicles of Christian kings. There is also lack of objec -\ntivity in many of the studies conducted so far. Many scholars who conducted the studies were attached to one or another member of the royal family. As such they made biases in favour of their attachment. Some scholars also lacked access to pertinent sources. Lack of sufficient knowledge on the political, social and cultural realities of the country was another cause for this lack of objectivity in writing Ethiopian history.

By contrast, secondary sources do not have direct relation or nearness to the event they describe. Most of them are historical reconstructions. The most important examples of primary sources are monuments, inscriptions, coins, letters, diaries, memoirs, chronicles, documents of contracts and agreements, photographs, films and eye-witness accounts. Most history books are also good examples of secondary sources of history. Oral sources could be taken as either primary or secondary sources. For instance, eyewitness information is a primary source. But the information recounted by informants who obtained information from other sources (hear say) is secondary source. \nCritical examination of both primary and secondary sources is very important for establish -\ning their authenticity (originality) and for a clear and deep understanding of their meaning \nand essence. Before we start writing history, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the meaning of our evidence. Otherwise, there is the possibility of misrepresentation or \nwrong interpretation of historical evidences. \n               \nActivity 1.3\n1.

Which one is a primary and secondary source:  monuments, novels, letters, \nmemoirs, articles, eyewitnesses, and chronicles?\n1.1.4. Periodization in History\nHistory is commonly studied on the basis of periodization. Periodization in history means the division of the entire human past into chronologically arranged shorter periods. Past events could be understood properly if they are presented in a time frame. The division of the past into shorter periods also simplifies the work of historians, not only by limiting themselves to the study of a certain period of time but also by presenting the results of their studies. This is because historians present past events by organizing them according to their sequence in time. \nHistorians follow different approaches to the periodization of history.  Some of these ap -\nproaches divide the entire history of humankind into different periods based on human \nbehavior, the process of tool making, and economic life. This periodizations start with the beginning of upright movement of hominids about 2.5 million years B.P (before present)."

The beginning of the technique of writing around 4000 B.C marked the \ndividing line between the two periods. All events that took place before 4000 BC are studied under prehistory. The prehistoric period overlapped with a period known as the Stone Age, which lasted from 2.5 million BP - up to 5000 BP (before present). During this period humankind used stone tools as instruments of labour. Based on the slow progress in producing stone tools, the Stone Age is divided into the Old Stone Age (2.5 million-8000 B.P), Middle Stone Age (transitional) and the New Stone Age (8,000-5000 B.P). \nThose events after 4000 BC are also studied under history. However, only a small part of \nthe human past has been recorded so far. But both the recorded part, and the part which still waits to be recorded, are commonly called history. In addition, since the technique of writing emerged at different times in different parts of the world, the distinction between pre-history and history varies from country, region or continent to another. \nThe period of history is further divided into three minor periods called ancient, medieval \nand modern; mostly in European history. There are no uniform or fixed time gaps for divi -\nsions throughout the world. Every continent or country followed the periodization that fits with its own civilization or state formation. For instance, the ancient period of European history started from the rise of civilization in ancient Greece about 1, 250 B.C and lasted up to 47 6 (end of 5\nth Century A.D) when the west Roman Empire collapsed. The medieval \nperiod lasted from the end of the 5th century AD up to the 1500 when early capitalist rela -\ntions began in Europe. The modern period also dates from about 1500 up to the present."

Theories of Origin\nHow long people have lived on earth remained unsettled for a long period of time and the \nquestion of the origin of human being attracted human thought for centuries. Since the middle of the 19\nth century, in particular, there has been a constant growth in the scientific \nknowledge of the origin of human beings. This was the result of the efforts made by schol -\nars attached to a number of newly emergent disciplines, like archaeology and anthropology. Currently, there are two major views concerning human origin. \n1. Creationist View\nThe term ‘Creationism’  refers to the  religious belief  that the universe , Earth, life, and hu-\nmans originated with  supernatural  acts of  divine creation. Accordingly, Creationists believe \nthat the earth and life on it including human beings with all complete physical shape and structure was created by a supernatural force. \n2. Scientific View\nThe scientific view about human origin is also called the theory of evolution. Evolution is the idea that the universe and life on earth were created by a process of evolution in that simple things developed into complex things over a very long time (millions or billions of years). Those who believe in this view are called evolutionists. They believe that simple form of life evolved into highly complex types of creatures such as humans. \nSince the emergence of the scientific view particularly in the 19\nth century, there was a strong \ndebate over the origin of human beings between the creationist and evolutionist groups. \nThis debate climaxed in the middle of the 19th century with the publication of Charles \nDarwin`s work entitled the “Origin of Species by Natural Selection” in 1859.  This theory explains that human beings developed from lower being through a gradual and natural process of change. Darwin`s scientific work described evolution and natural selection as theoretical explanation for evolutionary philosophy. Eventually, Darwin`s theoretical expla -\nnation became the most convincing of all theories of evolution. \n1.2.2.

These species are classified as members of \na separate zoological family called pongidae. Anthropologists believe that human beings, gorillas and chimpanzees all developed from a common ancestor that lived between 8 and 5 million years ago. Scientists have calculated that the split between hominids and the line leading to chimpanzees and gorillas occurred millions of years ago. Biochemical studies of fossil evidence have also told us a great deal about the relationship between humans and apelike creatures. \nAustralopithecines: The First Humans\nThe name Australopithecine translates literally as the “southern ape” in reference to South Africa, where the first known Australopithecine fossils were excavated by archaeologists. These earliest human species are believed to have evolved in Africa around 6 million years ago. Two of their important traits distinguished them from apes: small canine teeth and bipedalism - that is, walking on two legs as the primary form of locomotion. \nHowever, some characteristics of Australopithecines also reflect their ape ancestry. They \nhad a brain size of 390 -550 cc (cubic centimeter) in the range of an ape’s brain. Their body weight ranged from 27 to 49 kg, and they stood 1.1-1.5 m. Their weight and height compare closely to those of chimpanzees. Countries where fossil remains of genus Aus-tralopithecus were excavated include Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa and Chad.\nTable 1.2 The seven species of Australopithecines\nName of species Place of discovery Age (Estimated time) Year of Discovery\n1Australopithecus \nanamensisKenya 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago1994\n2Australopithecus afarensisEthiopia(Hadar in Afar region)3.9 - 2.9 million years ago1974\n3Australopithecus bahrelghazaliCentral Africa (around Lake Chad)3.5 – 3 million years ago1995\n4Australopithecus aethiopicusLake Turkana region in Kenya2.9 – 2.6 million years ago1985\n5Australopithecus africanusSouthern Africa 3 – 2.5 million years 1924\n6Australopithecus boiseiEast Africa 2.5 - 1.5 million years 1959\n7Australopithecus robustusSouthern Africa 2.5 – 1.5 million years 1938"

It is probably in Africa where the genus Homo originated about 2.5 million years ago. Australopithecus afarensis may well have been an ancestor of genus Homo. Compared to the species of Australopithecus, members of genus Homo had larger brains and smaller jaws. \nHomo habilis (handy human)  – were the first of the genus Homo, lived in eastern and \nsouthern Africa about 2 million years ago. Homo habilis made the first stone tools which \nconsisted of flakes and cores. They are known as Oldowan technology, named after the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania where they were first discovered. A partial skull of Homo habilis dated to about 1.9 million years ago was unearthed in the lower Omo basin in Ethiopia. Other important sites of Homo habilis include Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, Sterkfontein in South Africa and Lake Turkana area in northern Kenya. \nHomo erectus (upright human)  – seems to have originated in Africaand became the \nearliest hominid to move out of Africa into Asia and Europe. The oldest fossils of this \nspecies are about 1.7 – 1.8 million years old. Homo erectus had slightly smaller brain and slightly larger teeth than what modern human beings have. The species stood over 1.5 m and walked upright on two legs. \nHomo erectus was the first hominid to make little and precise stone tools with precise \nshape mainly the “hand axe”. These tools are usually referred to as “Acheulian” after the name of a small town in northern France, Saint-Acheul, where one of them was first dis -\ncovered. Homo erectus was probably the first hominid to master the use of fire around 1.5 million years ago. Fossil remains of Homo erectus have been unearthed at several sites in Ethiopia including Lower Omo Basin, Melka-Kunture, Konso-Gardula, Middle Awash (cen -\ntral Afar) and Gedeb (Gedeo zone). Homo erectus fossils were also found in Indonesia, Germany and China. \nHomo sapiens- are classified into “archaic” and “modern” Homo sapiens. The first seems \nto have evolved from Homo erectus sometimes between 300,000 and 600,000 years ago, \nand occupied much of Africa and Europe.  A partial cranium and other bones of archaic Homo sapiens were uncovered at Bodo in Middle Awash. Fossil remains and microlithic stone tools of archaic Homo sapiens have also been found at different sites in Africa and Eurasia."

Scholars named this human first technological advance the Stone Age. It began roughly 2.5 million years ago and ended in some parts of the world 5,000 years ago. Stone tool and weapon making by chipping one stone against another, and tool and weapon using behavior had a profound effect on human evolution.\nBased on the types of tools and tool making techniques, archaeologists commonly divide \nthe Stone Age into three stages. They are Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age) and Neolithic (New Stone Age). But many scholars use the one that divides the Stone Age into two major periods of Old Stone Age (2.5 million – 8000 B.P) and New Stone Age (8,000 – 5, 000 B.P) because they could not find the exact demarcating line between the Old Stone Age and Middle Stone Age tools."

Paleolithic people were hunter-gatherers.   \nArchaeologists further subdivide the Paleolithic period into three stages: Lower Paleolithic \n(2.5 million-200,000 B.P), Middle Paleolithic (200,000 - 30,000 B.P) and Upper Paleo -\nlithic (40, 000-10,000 B.P). The two successive Stone Age tool making technologies called Oldowan and Acheulean mentioned above characterized the Lower Paleolithic or early stage of the Old Stone Age. Oldowan stone tools were made by a technique called “direct percussion” (flaking). This tool making process created large, sharp-edged core tools capa -\nble of breaking bones and slicing meat or vegetation; and smaller flakes that could scrape hides and sharpen wooden sticks. \nTable 1.3 Oldowan Sites\nCountry Site Age\nEthiopia Gona, Afar, Omo 2.5 million years\n2.3 million years\nKenya Lokalalei, Koobi Fora 2.3 million years1.9-1.4 million years\nTanzania Olduvai Gorge 1.9 – 1.2 million years\nAlgeria Ain Hanech 1.7 million years\nSouth Africa Sterkfontein, Swartkrans 2-1.5 million years\nAcheulean stone tools refer to the “hand axe” technology that developed in Africa, the Near East, Europe and Asia dating from 1.5 million – 200,000 B.P. Acheulean tools are known as “bifaces” (flaked on both side), and usually had sharp edges, pointed end and were round at the top. The oldest Acheulean sites in Ethiopia include Konso-Gardula, Gedeb and Melka –Kunture. Oldowan tools are generally identified with Homo habilis, while Acheulean tools with that of Homo erectus."

Studies on \nMiddle Paleolithic populations help us understand the anatomy, behaviour, adaptation and cultural development of modern man. For instance, archaeological sites are often found in the deposits of caves and rock shelters for they were important to defend against predators, provide warmth and shelter. There was further refinement and standardization of tool mak -\ning techniques during this Paleolithic stage. In Africa south of the Sahara hominids stopped \nmaking hand axe and large tools about 200,000 years ago. Instead, they began to make a \nwide variety of smaller tools based on flake technology. Some of these tools were used as spear point and knives. This may have enabled hominids to further exploit the environment. \nGademotta archaeological site in central Ethiopian Rift Valley, dated to 200, 000 years ago, \nis one of the oldest Middle Paleolithic sites in Africa. Melka-Kunture, Porc Epic and Kone in Ethiopia; and Midhishi and Gud Gud in Somalia are other important sites that offered noteworthy information about Middle Paleolithic populations of the Horn of Africa. \nThe Upper Paleolithic (Later Old Stone Age) lasted from about 40,000 years ago until the \nend of the last “ice age” about 10,000 years ago. Standardized blade technology appeared and became more widespread than in previous times. Towards the end of Upper Paleolithic, microliths (small, geometric-shaped blade segments) became increasingly common in many areas. They were fitted into handles and used as “Composite tools” in arrows and bows”. In Africa these new tools are called Late Stone Age tools, whereas in Europe they are referred \nto as “Upper Paleolithic”. Bone was also commonly used to make tools of many types. It \nwas at this time that human biological and cultural evolution occurred at an increasingly rapid pace. \nNeolithic Revolution\nHominids spent ninety nine percent of their history extending back to at least 4 million years on hunting-gathering and consuming wild products of the earth.

This replacement of hunting and gathering ways of life by food production through \nthe domestication of plants and animals is referred to as the Neolithic Revolution. Scientists assume that the Neolithic Revolution independently started in different parts of the world at different times after 1 1, 000 years ago.  This revolution in subsistence is considered as a turning point in the history of human being. \nIn due course of time, most human groups adopted food production as their primary means \nof subsistence.  Many different people also began a slow process of artificial selection, tending plants and farming animals. As a result, humans` way of life and the landscape changed considerably. People began to organize themselves around a base camp to which they returned regularly. There were more innovations in artifacts and more advances were made in human behavior than before. \nOne of the better-known places in the world where agriculture first started is the Middle \nEast particularly the Fertile Crescent, which covers what is now Lebanon, part of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Syria and Turkey. We observe sites of sedentary life, domestication of plants and animals, new tools and diversification of human diets that implies the existence of divisions of labour. As a result of sedentary life, there emerged families and communities who inhabited defined territorial areas. Communities built stone houses and other kind of structures, which transformed into villages and very small towns. This was followed by the appearance of organized societies who were divided into classes of priests, chieftains, merchants, craftsmen, shepherds, etc. \nNeolithic humans invented the hatchet and millstone to grind cereals. They also made \npottery for food cooking and storage. Artifacts were increasingly exchanged. Sacred places and traditional religions emerged during this period. Finally, the first conflicts started among human beings during the Neolithic period. When a village lost its crop, its herds and when its population increased, it would be tempted to take the resources of nearby communities which led to conflict. \nThe Neolithic Revolution in the Ethiopian Region\nSome elements of the Neolithic tradition together with other cultural manifestations can be observed in the northern and southern parts of Ethiopia beginning from 4,000 B.C.

But the factor (factors) for the emergence of one state might not be the case with another state. \nReligion was one of the important factors for the emergence of states in antiquity. Reli -\ngion gave some feeling of security in the ancient world, where humankind was exposed \nto famine, war, diseases, and natural disasters. It was also believed to secure the fertility of crops, animals and women. So, priests who mediated between the gods and humankind were important. It is possible to assume that they combined religious power with political functions, and ultimately, became kings whose authority was based on religion. Kings were considered as representatives of the supreme god on earth. Thus, this theory is called the “Devine Right Theory”.\nWar leadership was another factor in the emergence of kingship in ancient times. With the \nfrequent existence of fierce and bloody wars, a permanent war leader would be needed. A successful permanent war leader would gain loyal followers and emerge as a king. \nAlthough trade existed long before the emergence of ancient states, it is very probable that \nit served as a factor for the emergence of states.

Scholars \napply this theory regarding the origin of oriental states, particularly ancient Egypt, whose civilization depended on the Nile River and that of Mesopotamia, which was located in the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates. In such civilizations where agriculture depended on large scale irrigation, a strong state power emerged because despotic state power was needed to organize labour for great irrigation and flood control works.  \nMain Features of the Early States\nEarly states of the world came into existence primarily as a result of the development of ag-riculture. This was because it was only agriculture that could provide regular surplus food to the farmers, and supported other classes, and state officials and soldiers.  States in antiquity had populations with divisions into classes, and with specialized skills such as craftsmen, soldiers, officials, etc. \nAncient states were different in size, power and level of “civilization”. The term “civilization” \ncomes from the Latin words for citizen and city. In this context, civilized states were states with cities where there were literacy, reasonably developed technology by the standards of the time and enough wealth to create great monumental architecture, like in ancient Egypt and Aksum. There would also be a developed religion or secular philosophy like that in ancient China. \nAncient empire states were seen as divinely created institutions, and their emperors were \nregarded as representatives of gods (later God) on earth.

It sheds light \non events of the past so that present society can learn from them.  History is as old as the existence of humanity on earth. But the systematic and organized study of the past emerged with the beginning of civilization and improved in content and quality as time went on. At the beginning of the 19\nth century, in Europe, history emerged as an independent profession -\nal field of study being taught at schools and university levels. History has also been made \npart of the school curriculum since the introduction of modern education to Ethiopia. \nThe study of history involves several key elements including critical evaluation of evidence, \nwriting objectively, and attractive and readable presentation. In this regard, history writing on Ethiopia, particularly during the imperial period that came to an end in 1974, had some problems, including imbalance of sources, and a lack of objectivity and comprehensiveness. Besides, as history is useful to humanity, it is often abused to justify current political or any other reality. \nBased mainly on archaeological evidences, the study of history also covers the prehistoric \nperiod, during which there was no technique for writing. The theory of evolution claims that human beings evolved from human-like primitive creatures to modern humans. The physical, mental and cultural evolution of human beings was partly made possible by the development of tool making. Tools and weapons were made mainly from stone using differ -\nent archaic technology, and thus, the period was called the Stone Age (2.5 million- 8000 \nB.P). Some other tools were also made from wood, bone and the like. During this very long period, humankind led hunting and gathering ways of life. \nHowever, in time, humankind learnt to domesticate plants and animals, which led to the \nbeginning of agriculture. This was what has been termed as the Neolithic Revolution by scholars. It is generally thought to have occurred sometime after 1 1,000 years ago in some parts of the world. The development of agriculture may have been completed by about 6000 B.C when the Old Stone Age came to an end in different parts of the world. Food production led to a sedentary way of life, the emergence of communities and bigger societ -\nies as well as the division of labour and specialization. The development of agriculture and the resultant surplus food production constituted the primary factor for the rise of the early states in antiquity, initially along river valleys."

Without the Nile, therefore, Egypt would be the infertile desperate desert. The political unity of Egypt was also made possible by the Nile River. Ancient Egyptians also \nused the Nile as a highway linking north and south . The kings could send officials or armies \nto towns along the river. The Nile thus helped make Egypt one of the world’s unified states. The river also served as a trade route. Merchants voyaged up and down the Nile in sailboats, exchanging the products of Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean region. Ancient Egypt had two distinct regions, Upper Egypt in the south and Lower Egypt in the north that covered the delta region. About 3,100 B.C., Menes, the king of Upper Egypt, united the two regions.

Under the vizier, various departments looked after such matters as tax collection, farming, and the all-important irrigation system. Thousands of scribes carried out the vizier’s instruction.  During the Middle and the New Kingdoms, the capital was moved to Thebes, much farther to the south. Ancient Egypt was divided into 42 provinces called nomes. The Pharaohs appointed government officials called nomarch to rule over the 42 nomes. \nThe peoples of ancient Egypt were divided into a hierarchy of social classes. At the top of \nthe social ladder was the Pharaoh. Next to the Pharaoh were government officials and reli -\ngious leaders. These were the high priests and priestesses (the female ones), who served the gods and goddesses. The class of merchants, scribes, and artisans formed the next hierarchy. They provided service for the rich and the powerful. At the bottom of the social ladder were the peasants who made up the majority of Egyptian society. They were farmers who worked the land. Of these, slaves formed the majority. They provided free labor services of various kinds and were the backbone of the economy. \nEgyptian women generally enjoyed a higher status and greater independence than women \nelsewhere in the ancient world. Under Egyptian law, women could inherit property, enter business deals, buy and sell goods, go to court, and obtain a divorce. They were not thus confined to the home. They manufactured perfumes and textiles, managed farming estates, and serve as doctors. Women could also enter the priesthood, especially in the service of the goddesses. The few women who learned to read and writewere, however, excluded from becoming scribes or holding government jobs.\nReligion is a major force that significantly shaped life in ancient Egypt.The people wor -\nshipped many gods and goddesses. Pharaohs, who were considered gods as well as mon -\narchs were said to have received their right to rule from the gods. Amon-Re, Osris, and Isis \nwere the gods and goddesses that they worshipped. Osris was particularly significant to the Egyptians since he was the god of the Nile, who controlled the annual flood that fertilized the land. During the Old Kingdom, Egyptian pharaohs built many necropolis or cemeteries \ncontaining majestic pyramids near Memphis. These are the oldest and largest stone struc-\ntures in the world registered in UNESCO as world heritage sites.

Its southern boundary was south of the Nile River’s sixth cataract.Like Egypt, Nubia was divided into upper and lower areas and lived along the Nile. However, in southern Nubia, unlike in Egypt, a climate that provided greater moisture meant farming was not limited to the Nile valley.\nThere had been cultural and technological relationships between Egypt and Kush. Egypt \ninfluenced the art and architecture of the Nubian region. The Nubians also worshiped some of the gods of Egyptians. They also adopted the customs and clothing styles of the Egyp -\ntians. They brought back royal rituals and a hieroglyphic writing system to Kush. However, the language has not yet been translated. They also adopted Egyptian pyramids.\nIn Nubia, women played an important role as Queens. Kush rose to power in the 700s B.C. \nThe Nubian kingdom of Kush conquered all upper and lower Egypt. In 75 1 B.C., Piankhi, a Kushite king, attacked the Egyptian city of Memphis. In the space of 15 years since the first conquest, Piankhi had gained control of Egypt. From this time on, two periods make up the history of Kush. Each period is based on the location of the capital and the king’s tomb. The city of Napata was the capital during this first period. Meroe was the capital during the second.Piankhi united Egypt and Kush and established Egypt’s 25th dynasty. Nubia was rich in goods that were scarce in Egypt: ivory, animal skins, timber, and minerals. This led to a lively trade along the Nile. Napata was the center for the spread of Egyptian goods and culture to Kush’s other trading partners in Africa and beyond. \nIn about 590 B.C, Meroe took the place of Napata as capital.  Meroe was located on the \nNile and on trade routes leading from the Red Sea to the interior of Africa. It had access to gold and iron. The defeat of Kush by the Assyrians (8\nth century B.C) taught the Kushites that \nthey needed iron weapons. Therefore, they learned iron smelting technology. Meroe was an ideal location for producing iron as it was located close to iron ore deposits. The prosperity of Meroe largely depended on trade. The main export items included ivory, slaves, skins, ostrich feathers, ebony and gold. \nThe power of Meroe reached its climax from the middle of the 3\nrdcentury B.C to the 1stcen-\ntury A.D.

He was responsible for seeing that the worship of the god was properly carried out. It was believed that the prosperity and security of the state was ensured by the proper worship of the god. \nMany inhabitants of the city-states lived within the walls of the cities. However, the major-\nity of these were farmers who were going out to work on the land daily. The other inhab-itants were priests, officials, soldiers, craftsmen and traders. The city-states used to import various commodities including timber and metals. Some supplies were also brought in by military expeditions or obtained as tribute. Unlike Egypt, there were no great monuments built for the kings and numerous gods in Mesopotamia. This was because stone and good timbers were not available for construction.

Cuneiform was written by pressing wedge-shaped marks with a hand instrument on \na tablet or soft clay. The clay then dried in the sun and became hard. Cuneiform was a complex, difficult, non-alphabetic writing system like hieroglyphics. \nThe Sumerians made remarkable contributions to law, arts, and science. The Mesopota -\nmians made careful study of the celestial bodies. They recognized the difference between \nplanets and fixed stars. This laid the foundation for the study of modern astronomy.\nBabylon was a great city in the ancient world located on the banks of the Euphrates River \nnear the present day city of al-Hillah, Iraq. It was the capital of the kingdom of Babylonia. The city was both an important trading and religious center. The word Babylon means gate of the god. Records first mention Babylon in about 2200 B.C. King Sumuabum, the first important Babylonian ruler, founded a dynasty in 1894 B.C. The best known king of that dynasty was Hammurabi who ruled from 1792 to 1750 B.C and was famous for developing a fair code of law. The economic laws show buying, selling, lending at interests and the existence of private property. The criminal laws were harsh and discriminatory across social classes and gender. Punishments for ordinary people were more severe and physical. Hammurabi’s code of laws became a model for later codes. In the struggle for power and empire by conquest, the Assyrians emerged on top and established the largest empire in the Middle East since the 9\nth century B.C. Its civilization was similar in many \nways to that of ancient Babylonia, its neighbor to the south. \nThe Assyrians have been called the Romans of Asia. Like the Romans, they were great \nconquerors. They won their victories in the Roman way, with excellent organization, weap -\nons, and equipment. The Assyrians were Semitic speakers and their homeland was in what is now northern Iraq. Their capital was at first Ashur, named after the chief god, and later Nineveh both cities on the Tigris River. The king of Assyria had absolute power. He ruled as the representative of the chief Assyrian god, Ashur. The Assyrian army, which consisted of cavalry, chariots and infantry, was efficient and well-organized. The Assyrians used a well developed siege techniques. The army was using iron weapons rather than bronze. Assyrian society consisted of nobles, free small scale land owners, private traders, hired people and a few slaves. Trade was important and a large part of the state revenues came from taxation on trade. \nAssyria declined after the mid-7\nth century B.C. The Medians and the Babylonians attacked \nAssyria.

The Assyrian Empire was replaced by the New Babylonian Empire, which, however, did not last long. The New Babylonian Empire began in 626 B.C, when the Babylonian military leader Nabopolassar became king of Babylon. Attacks by the Babylonians and their Median allies in 61 4 and 612 B.C., put an end to the Assyrian Empire. Under Nabopolassar, who reigned until 605 B.C., the New Babylonian Empire controlled much of the Middle East. Babylon achieved its greatest glory under the New Babylonian Empire. Nabopolassar and his son Nebuchadnezzar II rebuilt the city on a grand scale. During the reign of Nebuchadnezzar (605 to 562 B.C), workers built walls almost 26 meters thick. Nebuchadnezzar’s main palace and fortress stood along the Euphrates River. The famous Hanging Gardens is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. In addition, the area included the ziggurat, a monument that was known in later times as the Tower of Babel. Nebuchadnezzar’s successors were unpopular, and the empire became weak. In 539 B.C, Persian invaders captured Babylon and overthrew the New Babylonian Empire.\nAncient Persia was a land that included parts of what is now Iran and Afghanistan. The \nname Persia came from Persis, which was the Greek name for the region. The Persians called the region as the land of the Aryans, from which the name Iran comes, and their language Aryan. The founder of the Persian Empire was Cyrus the Great (557-530 B.C.). His successors further extended the empire until it was the largest of all ancient empires. The Persian Emperor was an absolute ruler, ruling as the representative of the Persian god, Ahura Mazda. The empire was divided into provinces called satrapies, each governed by an official called a satrap. The Persians taught their sons to ride horses, shoot bows and speak the truth. To lie and being in debt were considered disgraceful in Persian society. \nThe early Persians were farmers and traders. The Persian peasants used irrigation to grow \nwheat, barley, oats and vegetables. They used underground tunnels to avoid evaporation, and brought water from distant places. Caravans carried goods from many parts of the world through Persia to the Mediterranean Sea. A gold currency called darics was used all over the empire. The Persian darics were named after the emperor Darius I (5\nth century \nB.C.) who first issued them. \nZoroaster or Zarathustra was a Persian prophet who lived in the sixth century B.C.

After the destruction of the Indus Valley civilization, there was a movement of Indo-Aryan people who had lived in Northern India and Persia into the interior of Northern India. These people conquered the Dravidians and drove them out of northern India. The Indo-Aryans moved into the great plains of northern India, settled there and established the civilized states of ancient and medieval India. Southern India remained largely Dravidian. The religion of Hinduism developed from the beliefs of the early Indo-Aryans. One basic common idea of Hinduism is that mankind is condemned to a cycle of rebirths. A person can be reborn as someone spiritually higher and better or as someone (or even an animal) lower and worse. Salvation can be achieved in different ways. For instance, it can be attained by giving up the pleasures of the material world and seeking spiritual enlightenment under the guidance of a guru (holy man). Buddhism emerged from Hinduism as a reform movement. Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama (c.563 - 483 B.C.). Buddhism taught the “middle way” to salvation by avoiding extremes of asceticism on one side or materialism on the other side. It spread outside India to South East Asia, China, and Japan.\nIndian scholars increased the world’s store of knowledge. Learned Indians concerned \nthemselves with various fields of science and mathematics. Indian physicians made prog-ress in surgery and introduced the use of herbs to cure diseases. In the field of chemistry, Hindu scientists made it possible for craftsmen to tan leather dye cloth, and produce soap, cement, glass, and finely hardened steel. Indian scientists made their greatest con-tributions to mathematics. What we call Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.) were first used in India, later taken over and developed by the Arabs.

Chinese civilization and the Chinese state expanded over time to the centers and south of present day China. The first dynasty in China was called the Shang dynasty (c.1700 – 1 122 B.C.). The Shang kingdom was centered in the Huang-He valley. It became a highly developed society governed by a hereditary class of aristocrats. The dynasty’s accomplishments included the creation of magnificent bronze vessels, the development of horse drawn war chariots and the establishment of a system of writing. \nThe earliest forms of Chinese script were pictographs. They were drawings or pictures of \nthe objects they represented. As the Chinese script developed, characters became more simplified and less pictographic. The language consists of about 50,000 characters. The Chinese writing system is logographic.  About 1 122 B.C, the Zhou (Chou) people of west -\nern China overthrew the Shang and established their own dynasty and ruled China until 256 B.C. The last period of the Zhou was a period of intensive wars between the rulers of rival Chinese sates. In fact it is called the “warring states period” (403-221 B.C.). \nDespite these wars, the Chinese literary classics developed, and Chinese philosophy \nemerged. Confucius (55 1-479 BC) was the most influential and respected philosopher in Chinese history. His real name was Kong Qiu or K’ung Fu-Tzu which means Great Master Kong. His ideas, which are called Confucianism, stress the need to develop moral char -\nacter and responsibility. No book exists that was written by Confucius. His conversations and sayings were recorded by his disciples in a book called the Analects. His influence grew after his death so that in the end, Confucianism became the official and dominant ideology of China from about 100 B.C. to the revolution of 19 1 1.

He taught that society and states would be happy and prosperous if each individual kept to his or her proper place.For him,there are five cardinal human relationships: ruler to subject; father to son; husband to wife; elder brother to younger brother, and friend to friend. All these relationships except the last were relations of authority on one side and obedience and subordination on the other. However, Confucianism put great emphasis on personal ethics; summarizing ethics as “Do not do to others what you do not want done to you”. Mencius believed people were born good. He stressed the need to pressure “the natural compassion of the heart” that makes people human. Mencius emphasized the past as an ideal age and a model for examining present problems. \nDuring the later Zhou period, the rulers of the eastern states fought one another for \ncontrol of all China. In 221 B.C., the Qin (Chin) state defeated all its rivals and estab -\nlished China’s first empire under the First Emperor, Qin Shi Huang. The ruler believed in a philosophy called Legalism. Legalism emphasized the importance of authority, efficient administration and strict laws. A combination of legalistic administrative practices and Confucian moral values helped the Chinese empires endure for more than 2000 years. \nThe ancient Chinese are credited for many discoveries and inventions. The use of coal was \nfirst started by the Chinese. The Chinese were also the first to produce porcelain or Chi-naware. The wheelbarrow was also a Chinese invention. The varnish used to give a hard, glossy finish to wood, leather, and other surfaces originated in China. Another Chinese discovery is silk that could be made from the cocoons of silkworms. The Chinese started the silk industry and trade. Even more valuable was the manufacture of paper from cotton, a process invented about 150 A.D. The Chinese were the first to develop the technology of printing.  Another Chinese invention was gun powder, which was used in China as early as 600 A.D.\nFigure 2.3 Qin dynasty porcelain vases"

Tradition has it that about 753 B.C., \ntwin brothers by the name Romulus and Remus established a settlement on the Palatine \nHill, which is the center most of the Seven Hills of Rome. It is one of the most ancient parts \nof the city and has been called “the first nucleus of the Roman Empire.” Since 1000 B.C, the Latins, the first settlers of ancient Rome, lived on this hilly area. \nBeginning from the 7\nth century B.C, the Etruscans who had lived north of the Palatine hills \ncontrolled Rome. They are best remembered for the finely constructed roads, temples, and \npublic buildings in Rome. They also promoted trade and introduced the idea of the citizen assembly. Under Etruscan rule, Rome grew from a village of farmer and shepherds into a prosperous city. The city became so powerful that the people were able to drive out the Etruscans, overthrew the monarchy and established the Roman Republic in 509 B.C. The Senate was the most powerful government body of the Roman Republic. It conducted for -\neign policy, passed decrees, and handled the treasury of the republic. \nRoman social structure was hierarchical. Citizens were divided into three classes: the patri -\ncians (nobles), the Equites, and the plebeians (common people). The patricians were mem -\nbers of Rome’s oldest and richest families who held all the important political positions in \nthe state. All senators were patricians. The equites were the richest of the non-nobles. They also owned land but were sometimes businessmen as well. The plebeians, the ordinary cit -\nizens, were small farmers in the countryside but also craftsmen, shopkeepers, and laborers. They cultivated the latifundia (a large, landed estate) of the upper classes. However, the social system allowed mobility. Accordingly, skilled slaves, Greeks, and others might be"

Slave revolts were rare because they were crushed in the bud and the punishment for slave resistance and revolt was so violent. One such unsuccessful slave revolt was the one led by Spartacus that was staged from 73 to 7 1 B.C. Slaves who participated in the revolt were punished by crucifixion. Slaves were seldom set free by their masters by a system known as manumission (enfranchisement). However, the motive behind manumission was more economic than humanitarian as it was given quite often to skilled slaves so as to encourage good work.\nRome was slowly gaining military control over the rest of the Italian peninsula. Rome offered \nprotection and certain privileges of Roman citizenship to the cities it conquered. In return, the conquered cities supplied the Roman army with soldiers. By 270 B.C, Rome controlled most of Italy. Colonial expansion made Rome a mighty empire during the second and the first centuries B.C. In the process, however, Rome came into conflict first with Carthage, a sea power and trading center on the coast of northern Africa. Rome and Carthage fought for mastery of the Mediterranean Sea in three struggles called the Punic Wars. The war last -\ned from 204 to 1 46 B.C. After the Carthagian defeat, Rome controlled the Mediterranean coasts of Spain and Africa. Rome then turned to the east and conquered the Hellenistic monarchies, including Egypt. By the end of the first century B.C, Rome controlled the whole of the lands around the Mediterranean Sea.\nThough Rome scored important victories that expanded its empire, conflicts among lead -\ners caused upheaval in the Roman Republic during its last 100 years. Finally, a successful \ngeneral, Julius Caesar (100 B.C – 44 B.C), became sole ruler of the Roman world. In 44 B.C, a group of senators who feared his growing power assassinated Caesar. After his as -\nsassination, power was divided between Octavian (Julius Caesar’s adopted son) and Mark Antony (Julius Caesar’s friend). Octavian and Antony then fought each other for control of Rome. Antony sought the support of Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt (47 - 30 B.C). In 3 1 B.C, Octavian defeated the forces of Antony and Cleopatra and made Egypt aRoman province. In 27 B.C, Octavian became the first Roman emperor and took the title Augustus, thus named Augustus Caesars. In spite of his power, Augustus avoided the title of emperor. He preferred to be called princeps, meaning first citizen.\nThe reign of Augustus marked the beginning of a long period of stability, which became \nknown as the Pax Romana (Roman peace). The Pax Romana lasted about 200 years. Au-gustus established strong defense along the frontiers of the Roman Empire and kept the provinces under control. During this period, trade flourished, and art and literature grew"

In general, it was a roughly 200-year-long timespan of Roman history which is \nidentified as a period and golden age of increased as well as sustained Roman imperialism, order, prosperous stability, hegemonial power and expansion.\nThe Romans did not attain the cultural and intellectual advancements that the people of \nancient Greek registered. But they developed some fine Latin literature in poetry and prose. The Romans excelled in war, the arts of government, and law. Roman law became the base of many legal systems in Western Europe and Latin America. The Romans are remembered for the fine civil and military roads that they built to link the empire, and for the great aque -\nducts built to carry water to towns and cities. Some of the most famous Roman architecture includes the Roman Forum, the Temple of Venus and Rome, and the Roman Colosseum.  We owe the modern Latin alphabet to the Romans who themselves adapted it from the Etruscans and the Greeks. \nFigure 2.5. Roman Colosseum. \nIn 395 A.D, the Roman Empire was split into the West Roman Empire centered at Rome and the East Roman Empire or the Byzantine Empire centered at Constantinople (now Istanbul). After this time on, the West Roman Empire witnessed decline and shrink. Such Roman provinces as Spain, Gaul (now France), and North Africa were controlled by such Germanic peoples as the Vandals and Visigoths. In 410 A.D, the Visigoths looted Rome. In 47 6 A.D, the West Roman empire formally collapsed. Following this, Germanic chiefs established in -\ndependent kingdoms. However, the East Roman Empire survived until 1 453, the time when the Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople."

Within these \ngeographic regions lies Mesoamerica, which is made up of Mexico and Central America, a major spot where culture and civilization first thrived in that part of the world.\nSometime between 12, 000 and 10,000 years ago, most scholars believe, people first \narrived in the Americas from Siberia and Alaska through a land bridge currently known as the Bering Strait. In the Americas, as elsewhere, the greatest adaptation to this huge and new continent endowed with great mountains, rivers, jungles, and deserts occurred when people learned to domesticate plants and animals. These changes took place slowly between about 8500 B.C. and 2000 B.C. In Mesoamerica, Neolithic people cultivated a range of crops like beans, sweet potatoes, pepper, tomatoes, squash, and maize-the Na -\ntive American name for corn. People in South America cultivated crops such as maze and cassava and domesticated llamas and other animals valued for their wool. By 3000 B.C. in parts of South America and 1500 B.C. in parts of Mesoamerica, farmers had settled in villages. The population then expanded, and some villages eventually grew into the great early cities of the Americas. Now let us look into some of the major centers of culture and civilization that flourished in Mesoamerica.\n2.4.1.

By about 250 A.D., the Maya Golden Age also known as the Classic Period, began, \nwith city-states flourishing from the Yukatan Peninsula in Southern Mexico through much of Central America.\nBefore the Maya developed large population centers, they lived scattered across the land. \nThey developed two farming methods that allowed them to thrive in the tropical environ -\nment. The people had to clear the forest in order to plant on it. Along the banks of rivers, farmers built raised fields to lift crops up above the annual floodwaters, which allowed them to produce enough maize and other crops to support the rapidly growing cities.\nThe Maya cities that developed before and during the Classic Period never formed an \nempire. There were many city-states of which the most powerful were Tikal and Calakmul. Conflicts and wars were common among the different city-states. City-states maintained regular contact through trade, which generated a great deal of wealth. Trade goods in-clude items of daily use such as honey, salt, and cotton and nonessential but prized items such as feathers, precious stones, and jaguar hides, which might have been used in ceremonies or to show status. \nMaya society displayed distinct social hierarchy. Each Maya city had its own ruler, who \nwas usually male. Maya records and carvings show that women occasionally governed on their own or in the name of young sons. Nobles gave many functions such as military leadership, management of public works, collection of taxes, and enforce laws. Scribes, painters, and sculptors were also highly respected. Merchants formed a middle class in society; the wealthiest and most powerful merchants were certainly nobles. The majority of the Maya were farmers. They grew maize, beans, and squashas well as fruit trees, cotton and flowers. There were also slaves in some cities that had been captured in war.\nThe cultural life of the Maya included impressive advances in learning and the arts. In \naddition, they developed a complex polytheistic religion. The cities of Maya today are known for their towering temples and palaces built from stone. Temples rested on pyra-mid shaped platforms were the edifices where priests performed rites and sacrifices. Some temples also serve as burial places for rulers, nobles and priests. The Maya also developed a hieroglyphic writing system, which scholars did not interpret until recent decades."

Some suggest that over popu -\nlation, disease, or drought disrupted Maya life. Others think that peasants revolted against the priests and nobles.

The \nAztec empire reached its height under Montezuma II (1592-1521), who collected tribute from 37 1 states. The emperor had supreme power. He appointed officials to administer justice and regulate trade.\nLike the Romans, the Aztec built roads to link distant outposts to the capital. Soldiers were \nstationed at strategic spots along the roads to protect travelers such as merchants, who carried on a brisk trade. In the 1500s, Tenochtitlan was a bustling city with about 100, 000 inhabitants. As the population of the city grew, they expanded their island capital. Engineers built walkways, roads made of packed earth, to connect the island to the main -\nland. Farmers filled in parts of the lake and dug drainage canals to create more farmland. They anchored reed baskets filled with earth in the shallow lake. They then planted crops in the baskets, which became floating gardens.\nA huge pyramid temple and the emperor’s palace dominated Tenochtitlan. The palace \nserved as a storehouse for tribute. It also housed the royal family, thousands of servants and officials, a zoo, and a library of history books and accounting records. Like the Ro -\nmans, the Aztec adopted ideas from the people they conquered. Aztec priests used the knowledge of astronomy and mathematics. Like the Maya, they developed a 365-day so -\nlar calendar. Aztec priests used herbs and other medicines to treat fevers and wounds. Its physicians could set broken bones in place and treat dental cavities. They also prescribed steam baths as cures for various ills, a therapy still in use today. The Aztec worshipped many gods, including the gods of corn, rain, sun, and war. Their calendar was like a reli -\ngious text. It told the people which month was sacred to each god and goddess. A large class of priests performed the ceremonies that were meant to ensure the good will of the gods. Aztec religious practices included human sacrifices offered to the sun god.

The Inca empire stretched from what is today Ecuador through Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.\nThe Incas developed an efficient system to govern their huge empire. The emperor was \nan absolute ruler. He divided the empire into provinces and appointed nobles to govern them. Governors were responsible for taking a census so people could be taxed. The gov -\nernment was sensitive to the aged, sick and poor.\nLike many other peoples of the time, the Incas worshipped gods and looked to their \npriests to tell them the will of the gods. The Incas believed that the emperor was the son of the sun god, Inti, the chief god of the land. As a result, they called themselves the “children of the sun.” In Cuzco, the capital of the empire of Inca, priests and priestesses performed outdoor ceremonies in the Great Sun Temple. \nThe Incas developed advanced technology in many areas. They diverted streams and rivers \nto mine for gold, which artisans then made into fine ornaments. They also invented a sys -\ntem of measurement. Inca priests had enough medical knowledge to perform successful brain surgery.  They also learned to treat victims of malaria with quinine. Europeans did not understand the value of quinine until the 1800s. \nThe Inca were able to drag huge stone blocks to build magnificent temples and palaces. \nThey shaped the stones to fit perfectly without applying cement between them. During the violent earthquakes that occasionally rock the Andes, Inca stone walls sway, but they do not tumble down. They also built roads that linked distant provinces to Cuzco. The Inca also used their building skills for farming. Farmers built terraces, or flat areas, on steep mountainsides to create land that could be planted. \nThe Inca had no system of writing. Certain people, however, memorized their history \nand taught it to the next generation. In addition, the government recorded census data, the size of harvests and historical events. In the early 1500s, the Inca Empire reached its greatest size. When the Spanish soldiers arrived in the coast of Peru in 1532, internal power rivalery significantly weakened the empire, which paved the way for easy conquest."

While most Jews were reluctantly willing to live under Roman rule, others called zealots were not. They called on Jews to revolt against Rome. Some believed that a messiah (anointed king sent by God) would soon appear to lead their people to freedom. However, the rebellion did not last long.

It began among the followers of a Jew named Jesus.  Almost all the information we have about the life of Jesus comes from the Gospel, the first four books of the New Testament of the Christian Bible, which early Christians attributed the writing of these books to four followers of Jesus named St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, and St. John. According to Jesus, a person’s major duties were “to love the Lord your God with all your heart” and “to love your neighbor as yourself.” He also emphasized the importance of forgiveness. Some Jews welcomed Jesus to Jerusalem. Others regarded Him as a dangerous troublemaker. Jewish priests, in particular, felt that he was challenging their leadership. To the Roman authorities, He was seen as a revolutionary who might lead the Jews in a rebellion against Roman rule. At about 30 A.D., He was arrested and was tried and then condemned to death by crucifixion.\nThe first Christians were Jews in Palestine and Syria. Soon, many gentiles (non-Jews) were \nconverted to Christianity. The number of gentile Christians gradually exceeded that of the Jewish Christians. Finally, Jewish Christians were either assimilated into gentile Christianity or went back to Judaism and ceased to be Christian. The head of each local Christian community was the bishop. In time, archbishops appeared who had spiritual authority over the bishops, other clergy and laity of a large area. Then the rank of patriarch emerged. A patriarch had spiritual authority over the archbishops, bishops, other clergy and laity of very large regions called patriarchates. There were five patriarchates: Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople and Jerusalem. Earlier, the Patriarch of Rome, also called the Pope, was claiming leadership over the other patriarchs. From about the middle of the third century onwards, monasteries where monks and nuns lived in separate communities were estab -\nlished. Those monks who lived together had a leader called abbot and those monks who lived alone were called hermits.\nDoctrines which were rejected and condemned by the Church were called heresies and the \nfollowers of these doctrines were called heretics. The Church’s doctrines were approved by Church councils, which were meetings of the patriarchs, archbishops and bishops of the Church. The Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D. established the doctrine of the Holy Trinity and this doctrine was confirmed by the Council of Constantinople in 385 A.D. The doctrine of the Holy Trinity says that one God exists in three persons: God the Father, God the Son (Je -\nsus) and God the Holy Spirit and that all these persons are equal. The council condemned Arianism, a belief that rejected the divine nature of Jesus."

It is generally accepted that Northeastern Africa is the cradle of man. Various archeological evidences in the Awash and Omo basins af -\nfirmed and reaffirmed that the first man appeared in this part of Africa. The discovery, in 1974, of a hominid that dated back to 3.18 million years ago at Hadar, located in the Afar lowlands, is the ultimate proof of the authenticity of this information. This partial skeleton of a fully grown woman was nicknamed “Lucy”, whom the Ethiopians prefer to call “Dinqnesh,” a pointer to her alleged beauty.  \nEthiopia is one of the places of the ancient world where culture and civilization flourished. \nMany peoples from diverse ethnic groups having different languages, religions, traditional val -\nues and lifestyles have lived in Ethiopia for a long period of time. The saying; “Ethiopia is a mo -\nsaic of people,” comes from this cultural and linguistic diversity.  The diversity itself comes from the socio-economic, political, and historical processes that shaped modern Ethiopia. This does not mean, however, that Ethiopians have nothing to share in common. Ethiopian Christians and Muslims, for example, have come together over matters of national interest and have made common fronts in defending the sovereignty of the country from repeated but unsuccessful foreign aggressions. Such standards of behavior as patriotism, respect for the elderly, coopera -\ntion in times of hardship, hospitality and many other similar personality traits are deeply rooted in the minds and hearts of all Ethiopians irrespective of the cultural differences we mentioned earlier. \nLearning Outcomes :  At the end of this unit, you will be able to: \n\t differentiate the main language supper families of Ethiopia;\n\t examine the nature of interaction among different peoples of Ethiopia to \nthe end of the thirteenth century;\n\t analyze the major achievements of the Pre Aksumite and Aksumite king-\ndoms;"

Ethiopia is perhaps the only country in Africa to have its own written alphabet, the Ethiopic script. However, we are not pretty certain to provide the accurate number of languages spoken by the peoples of Ethiopia. Linguistic evidence informs us that there are about 85 languages spoken in the region. Languages which belong to the same group share certain basic vocabulary that trace back to a common origin. Linguists refer to this shared origin as the proto-language or the ancestral language. The peoples of Africa in general speak languages that belong to four super-families or proto-languages namely Afro-Asiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Congo and Khoisan.

This super-family has six families. They are Cushitic, Omotic, Semitic, Berber, Chadic, and ancient Egyptian. Of these, the first three are spoken in Ethiopia and the Horn, while the remaining three are spoken in North East Africa. \nThe majority of the peoples of Ethiopia and the Horn are speakers of the Cushitic family, which \nis sub-divided into four branches. They are North Cushitic, Central Cushitic, East Cushitic and Southern Cushitic. Southern Cushitic is spoken outside the Horn of Africa in Tanzania. The North Cushitic is represented by a single language spoken by the Beja people of north-western Eritrea and the adjoining districts of the Republic of the Sudan. The Central Cushitic languages are spoken by the Bilen, Agaw, Hamtang, Qimant and Awign. The languages of this branch are sometimes called the Agaw languages, since they have an Agaw background. Bilen is spoken in the Bogos or Keren area of Eritrea. \nAmong the Cushitic branches, the most diversified and the largest in the region is the East \nCushitic. This branch is further divided into two sub-branches named Lowland East Cushitic and Highland East Cushitic. Highland East Cushitic speakers live in the south central highlands of Ethiopia. The speakers of this sub-branch include Hadiya, Kambata, Sidama, Gedeo, Halaba, Burji and Libido. The Lowland East Cushitic sub-branch includes the Afan Oromo, Afar, Somali, Konso, Gidole, Erbore, Dassanach, and Saho languages. \nThe Omotic family is spoken mainly by the peoples living in the Omo valley in Southern and \nSouth western Ethiopia. But in ancient times, they seem to have been widely distributed in the region further north. One evidence for this is the existence of the speakers of this family outside the Omo river basin. For instance, the Shinasha in Benishangul-Gumuz Regional state and the South Ma’o in South-western Wallagaa are the speakers of the languages of the Omotic family. The main speakers of this family are Wolaita, Gamo, Gofa, Dauwro, Konta, Dizi, Kafa, Maji, Ari, Sheko, Dorze and Yem. The other languages of this family are spoken by other groups of people in Southern Ethiopia. This language family is spoken only in Ethiopia.\nThe Semitic languages of Ethiopia and the Horn are generally known as Ethio- Semitic. This is \nmainly to distinguish the Semitic languages of the region from the Semitic languages spoken in other parts of the world, particularly in the Middle East, such as Arabic and Hebrew. The Ethio-Se -\nmitic languages are sub- divided into two: North Ethio- Semitic and South Ethio-Semitic. The North Ethio- Semitic languages are Tigre (in Eritrea), Tigrigna and Ge’ez. Geez had long ceased to be a spoken language of the region. But it still survives as a literary language of the Orthodox Tewahido Church of Ethiopia. Tigrigna is spoken in Tigray as well as in Eritrea. Tigre is spoken only"

The South Ethio-Semitic is represented by the Gafat, now dead, (extinct), because no \none speaks it, the Gurage, Amharic, Argoba, Harari, and Silti people. \nThe languages of the Nilo-Saharan super-family are also spoken in Ethiopia. The majority of the \nspeakers of these languages live in the present Regional States of Beni-Shangul Gumuz and Gam -\nbella. Most of them live in the hot lowlands and valleys between Ethiopia and the Sudan from north to south. The main speakers of this super-family in Ethiopia are Anuak, Nuer, Majang, Mien, Berta, Gumuz, Komo, and Ma’o.

However, we do not know their origin and we cannot establish their evolutions across different periods.They are many in number owing to cultural and linguistic differenc -\nes. Among indigenous religious systems, the names of certain deities and spirits reappear frequently, especially among groups speaking related languages. Certain features of these traditional belief systems are broadly similar--for example, the existence of a supreme being identified with the sky addressed through spirits. Despite the above outward similarities, the arrangement of the accepted list of spirits, the ceremonies or rituals addressed to them, the social units participating in the officiating of specific rituals, and the nature and functions of religious specialists are peculiar to each ethnic group or sub-section. \nWaqefanna is one of the indigenous religions in Ethiopia practiced by the Oromo peo -\nple. Since Waqefanna is associated with community life, there is no element of conver -\nsion or evangelization.Therefore, a person has to be born in a particular society in order \nto be follower of the religion of the society to which he/she belongs.The participants in Oromo religion learn the religious traditions from their forefathers. Among the Oromo, the Qallu (the male) and Qallities (the female) priests hold places of honor. The position of Qallu/Qalliti is much like that of a high priest.There is also another office that is of importance known as the Abba Muda, the spiritual leader whose blessings took special place among the Oromos. \nThe Oromo religion focuses on one God known as Waqa. Waqa is the source of all life and is the Creator. Waqa is infinite and omnipresent. Everything has been placed in order by Waqa and he is its designer and guardian. Waqa is not the only spiritual being recog -\nnized by the Oromo religion. There are numerous divinities called Ayyana, which are man -\nifestations of Waqa’s creative spirit. These are not additional gods, but rather part of the divine essence of Waqa. The Qallus/Qallities maintain a line of communication between the Ayyana and the Oromo community in which they serve.The institution of the Qallu/Qalliti and its connection to Waqa are the central aspects of Oromo religion. \nIn relation to Oromo identity there are several aspects of the religious system that are signif -\nicant. The continued adherence to the shared religion that worshiped Waqa, the recognition"

The \npilgrims to Abba Muda were delegates, who were the representatives of Oromo confed-eracies. Those who went to Abba Muda received his blessings and anointments on the ceremonial practice of Jila.  Jila was considered the link between the spiritual father and the nation. Abba Muda anointed the Jila and commanded them to be righteous, not to recognize any leader who tried to get absolute power and not to fight each other.    \nThe Hadya also had an equivalent to the Oromo Waqa known as Waa, followed in the \nhierarchy by spirits who attracted most of the prayers and the sacrifices. He is believed to be the first being and creator of the universe. The sun and the moon are perceived as the eyes of the Waa. The Hadiya known by the name Worqimene, are believed to have the power to send rain in droughts. Fandanano (singular, Fandancho) practice is believed to be introduced by spiritual leaders, Itto and Albaja, or Boyamo, father of five Hadiya clans. The Kambata, Guraghe, Walayta, Kafa, the Nuer, and Konso also practiced a much similar indigenous religion to the Oromo and Hadya. \nCase Study 2:\n -It is very difficult to exhaustively address all indigenous religions that have \nbeen practiced in Ethiopia at this point.

Judaism entered Ethiopia as early as the 8\nth century B.C. Although not written until the early medieval era, it is around this time \nthat the story of the affair of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba emerged. Eager to see the wisdom of King Solomon, the legend goes on to say, the Queen made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. On having seen her, the king felt in love with her. Then she bore King Menelik I from Solomon. In his second sojourn to Israel that he made to visit his father, he came back to Ethiopia escorted by Jewish priests and soldiers.

The trilingual \n(written in Geez, Sabean, and Greek) inscription belonging to Ezana confirmed his conver -\nsion when it says: “in the faith of God and the power of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.” Likewise, the coins minted in the latter part of his reign bear the sign of the cross. Later, Frumentius went to Alexandria and told the whole affair before the newly- appointed patriarch, Athanasius, begging him to appoint a bishop to minister to the needs of the growing Christian community in Ethiopia. Accordingly, the patriarch consecrated Frumen -\ntius as the first bishop of Ethiopia. According to the chronological lists of the Ethiopian bishops, Frumentius was succeeded by Minas who was apparently of Egyptian origin. From this time on began the peculiar Alexandrian jurisdiction over the Ethiopian Church. The \nEgyptians inserted the 42\nnd Pseudo-Canon of the Council of Nicea that prohibits Ethiopi -\nans from occupying this position. Thus, an Egyptian bishop always remained at the head \nof the Ethiopian Church until 1959, the time when Abba Basilios was ordained as the first \nEthiopian born patriarch.  \nUnlike the Roman Empire, in Ethiopia, Christianity was introduced first into the royal court, \nand from there gradually penetrated among the common people. In the Roman Empire, the \nApostles and later the Church Fathers were actively engaged in the evangelization of the \npeople. In Ethiopia, Christianity was voluntarily adopted.\nHowever, it was after the coming of the Nine Saints that Christinity spread among a large \nsection of the population. These were (Abba Aregawi or Ze Mikael, Abba Penelewon, Abba \nGerima (Issac, or Yeshaq), Abba Aftse, Abba Guba, Abba Alef, Abba Yem’ata, and Abba Liqanos, and Abba Sehma). They came from different parts of the Eastern Roman Empire. In \nAksum, they studied the Geez language and became familiar with the people and their cus -\ntoms. After such preparation, they set out in different directions to preach and to introduce \nmonastic institutions. The Nine Saints sustained no persecution in their effort to spread \nChristianity since they gained the protection and support of the sovereigns.\nThe Nine Saints contributed greatly to the development of the Ge’ez liturgy and literature. \nBut their major contribution was undoubtedly their great work in the translation of the Holy \nBible into Ge’ez. The creation of Ethiopian church liturgy and hymns is, however, attributed \nto Saint Yared. The influence of the Nine Saints extended also to art and architecture. The ruins of basilicas found in the ancient cities of Aksum, Adulis, and Hawlti may show a re -\nsemblance to Syriac churches of Eastern Mediterranean.

This is a religion based on the worship of \nAllah, and Mohammed, His messenger. However, he and his followers faced serious oppo -\nsition and then persecution by the Quraysh Arabs, the clan to which the Prophet belonged. As the persecution became worse, in 615 A.D., the prophet decided to send some of his followers, including one of his daughters, Fatuma, to the kingdom of Aksum. The leader of this emigration was the cousin of the prophet named Jafar. \nThe Prophet believed that if his followers moved to a place where Christianity was practiced, \nthey would be adequately cared for. This was not a mistake on the prophet’s part.They were warmly welcomed by the Aksumite king and were offered the much sought asylum at Aksum.

Back home, they had to resist the ever increasing power of the prophet and his followers. However, Jafar and his friends stayed in Ethiopia peacefully under the king’s protection until the Prophet Mohammed entered Mecca triumphantly in 634 A.D. As a result of this, the prophet Mohammed gave orders to his followers to the effect that they should not attack and convert the Ethiopians by force in the future. As noted earlier, unlike the situation in other parts of the world, Islam entered to Ethiopia peacefully. After these early contacts, Islam then began to enter Ethiopia and the Horn on a larger scale through two directions:  Dahalak Islands on the Red sea, and the port of Zeila on the Gulf of Aden. By the beginning of the 8\nth century A.D., Islam was firmly \nestablished in the Dahlak Islands. Two centuries later, the prosperous Muslim community on the islands developed into a sultanate. \nAt about the same time, other places on the Red Sea coast were settled by Muslims. It \nwas from this coastal center that Islam gradually spread among the predominantly pastoral communities of the interior, largely through the agency of preachers and traders. The Da -\nhalak trade route, however, played a minor role in the introduction of Islam to the interior. Because, Christianity was deeply seated in the northern part of Ethiopia, long before the introduction of Islam.

Information \nabout the existence of a cultural center in the Horn of Africa under this name comes from Egyptian sources that tell us about a series of naval expeditions that the Egyptian Pharaohs sent to the land of Punt. It was, therefore, a trading partner of ancient Egypt. Pharaoh Sahure (r. 2743-273 1 B.C.) sent an expedition to collect myrrh, ebony and electrum (gold and silver alloy). However, the best described and illustrated expedition was the one undertaken by the order of the famous Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut (1 490-1 468 B.C.), whose expedi -\ntion is documented at her tomb in Dier El Bahri.

An alternative assumption makes the location from Swakim or Massawa to Babel Mandeb. \nDa’amat: - Da’amat (980 B.C.-400 B.C.) was the first historically known state in Ethiopia \nlocated a little to the south of Aksum. The capital of Da’amat was Yeha, located 30 kilo -\nmeters to the northeast of Aksum and was the oldest of these centers. It probably emerged around 1,000 B.C. as a small commercial center, evolved into a capital where South Arabian merchants and their agents bought and stored ivory, rhinoceros horn and other commodi -\nties coming from the interior. It seems that the period of its prosperity was from about 750 to 500 B.C. The ruins of some of its buildings’ walls and stone masonry, as well as the still-standing temple and inscriptions, attest to Yeha’s glory.\n . The Kingdom of Da’amat was \nvery important because it made iron tools, weapons, and grew millet. It traded gold, silver, slaves, ivory and tortoise shells with South Arabian merchants. The Kingdom was able to do this because the location of its capital Yeha had good access to both the Red Sea and to Yemen in the East. Other cities that played a role in the Kingdom of Da’amat include Qohaito and Matara. In fact both these cities thrived as a stop on the trade route between Adulis and Aksum during the Empire of Aksum (100 B.C-940 A.D.).As we shall consider below, cultural and technological advancements after Damat continued with the kingdom of Aksum, which took Ethiopia to one of its glorious days.\n   Activity 3.2\n1.

Yet, as they did not speak each other’s language, and did not even trust to be near to each other to bargain through signs and gestures, the whole exchange was done without one side seeing the other. This was a good example of a silent trade. \nAksumite kings had extensive contacts with the outside world notably with the South Ara -\nbian region, leading to exchange of ideas, material and spiritual culture. Sometimes such \ncontacts involved conflicts between the two regions. One of such known recorded conflict between areas on both sides of the Red Sea took place around 200 A.D. Accordingly, peoples in Southern Arabian Peninsula, in present day Yemen, had difficulties in defending themselves against the army of the Aksumite king, Gadarat. \nFrom the 3\nrd to 7th centuries, Aksumite kings minted and issued different kinds of coins \nmade of gold, silver and bronze for both overseas and local transactions. Aksum was one \nof the four great powers of the world at the time. The other three were Rome, Persia, and China. It was a major naval and trading powers from the 1\nstto the 7thcenturies. Aksum de-\nveloped ship building technology at Adulis. It had a large fleet of ships, which was used not only for trade but also for war purpose across the Red Sea. \nKing Kaleb (r. 500-535 A.D.) expanded overseas territories of Aksum beyond Himyar and \nSaba, but the local prince Dhu-Nuwas was converted to Judaism, marched to Zafar and Nagran, and killed many Christians. With the help of Byzatine fleet sent by Justinian (r. 527-565), Kaleb defeated Dhu-Nuwas and appointed Abreha as governor that continued until 570 A. D. Kaleb was succeeded by his son Gebre Mesqel (535-548) who built the church of Zur Amba Aregawin Gayint. It was during Gebre Mesqel that Yared developed the Ethiopian Orthodox Church liturgical songs and hymns."

Environmental degradation, decline in agricultural productivity and \npossibly plague infestation started to weaken it. With the destruction of the port of Adulis \nby the Arabs around 702, her economic artery was cut. The whole network of Aksumite international trade came under the control of the rising and expanding Arab Muslims and the Aksumite state was isolated from its old commercial and diplomatic partners. Conse -\nquently, the Aksumite state declined economically. This naturally led to the decline of its \npolitical and military power not only on the Red Sea coast but also in its interior provinces. The recurring rebellions of the Beja, the Agaw and Queen Bani al Hamwiyah (Yodit) finally sealed the collapse of the Aksumite state. However, as a civilization, Aksum had a profound impact upon the peoples of the Horn of Africa and beyond. \nThe Aksumites had developed the technology of coin mintage. The period of Aksum is \nalso remembered for its fine architectural achievement. The still standing and the several ruined steles witness this magnificent architectural development. The entire structure is grouped under three types- well-made and decorated, half completed, and megaliths. As local tradition says, the steles were engraved specifically at Gobodara from which they were transported and erected in Aksum. The longest one of these stele measures 33meters. It is highly decorated in all of its four sides. It represents a 1 4 storied building with many false windows and a door at the bottom. It also bears pre-Christian symbols, which are a disc and a crescent at the top. \nThe second major contribution is related to the art of writing.

For instance, Da’mat was described as D’mt. \nAfter the seventh and sixth centuries B.C, however, variants of the script arose, evolving in the direction of the Geez script. This evolution can be seen most clearly in evidence from inscriptions, mainly writings /drawings on rocks and caves. By the 1\nstcentury A.D., the Geez \nalphabet was developed, 26 consonant letters, written left-to-right with letters identical to the first-order forms of modern vocalized alphabet.

The territory of the Zagwe kingdom extended from most of the highland provinces of the ancient Aksumite kingdom in the north down to northern Shewa in the south; the Lake Tana region and the northern part of what is today Gojjam in the west. The Agaw maintained the ancient Aksumite traditions almost intact. The Zagwe rulers renewed cultural and trade contact with the eastern Mediterranean region. The most important export items were ivory, spices, and slaves while cotton, linen, silver and copper vessels, and newly minted coins were imported.\nFigure 3.2 Bete-Giyorgis, one of the 1 1 Rock Hewn Churches of Lalibela\nFurthermore, the Zagwe period was well known in paintings and the translation of some re -\nligious works from Arabic to Ge’ez.

Bete Giyorgis, built in the shape of a perfect cross, is the best among the churches at Lalibela that shows the extraordinary architectural skill of the period. The Lalibella churches are regarded as some of the finest structures in the Christian world, registered as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1978.  Further refinement can be observed in the construction and decoration of the rock hewn churches. The build-ers had utilized softer materials like sandstone, which was squarely cut and shaped into a variety of delicately decorated churches.\nOnce the Muslim Arabs controlled the lands along the Red-Sea and North Africa, they \nmade it difficult for Ethiopian Christian pilgrims to visit Jerusalem.

During the period between 1 413 and 1 478, the pressure changed dramatically from gradual encroachment to full-scale wars led by the emper -\nors. The most serious war was that they made against King Yishaq. About 1 413, the king conquered them in Wogera. As a result of their severe defeat, they were forced to convert to Christianity. Yishaq proclaimed that: “He who is baptized in the Christian religion may inherit the land of his father; otherwise let him be a “Felasi” (exile”) from which the name Felasha might be derived. Because of their refusal to the above decree, they were deprived of their rights to inheritable land. In order to survive, the Bete-Israel developed handicrafts. They probably received an additional incentive to become blacksmiths from Yishaq’s desire to improve the weaponry of the Christian army. From the reign of Zera Ya’iqob (r. 1 434-1 468) on, a group of blacksmiths travelled with the royal court. Other Beta-Israel survived by withdrawing to economically marginal areas. After 1540, they broadened their range of crafts from blacksmiths to builders. Some of the ruins and still standing structers are located in Guzara, Gorgora, and Azezo. In addition to such kind of economic experiement, they had maintained a high degree of religious integrity and social self-isolation.\nIn the field of religion, most of the texts and prayers such as the Te’ezaza Senbet, the most \nimportant Beta-Israel text, probably date from the period of Zera Ya’iqob.

Its final collapse \nwas the result of worsening internal problems, the separation of the Western Empire from \nthe wealthier Eastern part (395 A.D), and outside invasions by successive waves of Ger -\nmanic people. The Germanic tribes originally came from Scandinavia in northern Europe and moved to central Europe in earlier times. By the 3\nrd century A.D, they occupied the \nnorthern and northeastern frontiers of the Roman Empire. Some German tribes adopted the civilization of their Roman neighbours. They traded with Roman merchants, learned to farm the land, and accepted Christianity as their religion. But most Germans were organized into tribal lines, each being governed by a chief. The Romans called them ‘barbarians”. \nIn the 5\nth century A.D, in an effort to escape from attacks by the Huns of central Asia, \nGermanic tribes began invading Roman territory itself. By then, the Roman Empire had lost \nmuch of its great power, and its armies could not defend the longer frontier. The Visigoths \ninvaded Spain in about 416 A.D. Angels, Jutes and Saxons began to settle in Britain in about 450 A.D. The Franks established a kingdom in Gaul (now France) in the 480s A.D. At about the same time, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy. In 47 6 A.D, Rome fell into the hands of the Germanic tribes.  \nThe invasions of Germanic tribes divided the huge Roman Empire into many Germanic \nfeudal kingdoms. The strong local governments of the empire disappeared. The invasions also destroyed the trade that the Romans had established. Consequently, the majority of the people moved from towns to the countryside and became peasants. Some towns were \ncompletely abandoned and gradually disappeared. Ancient literature, architecture, painting \nand sculpture declined. However, the Roman Empire passed on to Europe some important things, especially the Latin language and literature and Roman law. \nThe Roman Christian church was the only surviving institution that provided leadership for \nthe people and saved Western Europe from complete ignorance. The popes, bishops, and other church leaders took over many functions of government after the Roman emperors 4.1.1. The Fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Dawn of the Middle Ages"

The Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire\nIn 330 A.D, the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great moved his capital from Rome to Byzantium.  The city was renamed Constantinople after him. The Roman Empire was prac -\ntically divided into the West Roman Empire and the East Roman Empire in 395 A.D. The Eastern Roman Empire was called Byzantine after the previous name of Constantinople. The Western Roman Empire finally collapsed in 47 6 A.D, while the East continued to survive for another one thousand years. This was because the East Roman Empire was not geographi -\ncally so open to attacks by German tribes, except in the Balkans. It was also richer and had more population and more towns and cities with defensive walls than the west. \nIn the Byzantine Empire, the emperor was the absolute ruler and sole law maker. Empress \nTheodora (497-548), who was Justinian`s wife, advisor, and co-ruler, contributed to the greatness of the empire. She sometimes challenged her husband, and pursued her own policies in government affairs. The government controlled every aspect of life and also had much influence over church officials. The people paid heavy taxes to support the govern -\nment. The Byzantine Empire reached its greatest size under Justinian I (r. 527-565A.D). During his reign, Italy, part of Spain, and the old Roman province of “Africa” (now Tunisia) in the west were conquered. The empire had already incorporated Asia Minor (now Turkey), the Balkan Peninsula, Egypt, Palestine and Syria.\nThe Byzantines organized many laws of the ancient Romans. This collection of laws was \nreferred to as the Justinian Code and, ever since, has been the basis of the legal systems of many countries. Justinian also built the church of Hagia Sophia (St. Sophia), from 532 to 537 A.D, which was the empire`s largest and most splendid Christian church in Constan -\ntinople. Most of the people of the Byzantine Empire were poor farmers who raised grapes, olives and wheat or herded sheep. Merchants and craft workers practiced their trade in the towns and large cities. The empire imported silk, spices, and luxury goods from China."

Byzantine missionaries spread Christianity throughout the empire, and converted the Russians and other Slavic peoples to Orthodox Christianity. They also translated church services and the Bible from Greek into the old Slavonic lan -\nguage, in addition to inventing an alphabet (later called Cyrillic) for it. The Cyrillic alphabet is used in Russia and much of the Balkans today. \nIn the 1 1\nth century (1054 A.D), the Medieval Christian church split into two branches, \nnamely the Western Catholic and the Eastern (Greek and Russian) Orthodox churches. One \nof the reasons for this division was the dispute over the authority of the church. The Eastern Orthodox Church did not accept that the pope of Rome had jurisdiction over the East as well as the West and the right to decide by himself on matters of Christian doctrine. \nAfter Justinian`s death in 565 A.D, Germanic tribes attacked the Byzantine empire on all \nfronts. The empire was also highly threatened by Persian invasions. However, Heraclius (r. 610-642 A.D) ended the Persian threat by defeating them in the bloody, ravaging and exhausting war he waged on them between 624 and 626 A.D. But the empire lost much territory to the Arabs in the 7\nth century A.D. \nThe Byzantine Empire began to collapse in the 1 1th century. By 107 1, the Normans (Vikings \nor Norsemen) from the kingdom of Frank had taken southern Italy. In the same year, the Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert.

In 1095, Emperor Alexius I Comnenus (r. 1081- 1 1 18) asked the Christians of Western Europe to help defend the empire against the Turks.  The successive military expeditions of Christians against the invaders of the Holy Land became known as the Crusaders. During the first crusade (1096-1099), crusaders regained the coastal regions of the Holy Land. In the long run, however, they could not save the Byzantine Empire. By the late 1 4\nth century, \nonly Constantinople and parts of Greece were all that remained of the empire. Finally, the Byzantine Empire collapsed in 1 453, when the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople. The last Byzantine Emperor, Constantine XI, died while defending the city. \n          4.1.1.2 Western Europe During the “Middle Ages”\nDuring the “Middle Ages”, the former West Roman Empire passed through a period of polit -\nical, social, and economic decline. The region was politically divided, rural and cut off from \nother civilization centers of the world. Besides, the region was overrun by waves of invaders, the trade system the Romans had established was now disrupted, towns were abandoned and classical culture was destroyed in the region. Because of this, in Europe the period was formerly called “the Dark Age” of warfare and confusion. \nNowadays, however, historians recognize that this period was not really dark. Instead, it was \nthe period during which Greco-Roman, Germanic and Christian traditions slowly blended, creating what came to be known as medieval civilization, also known as the “Middle Ages” (500-1500 A.D). To mention some of the achievements of the period, Christianity became the religion of the western world, universities were founded, the modern nation states of Europe had their beginnings and the languages of present-day Europe developed. \nAs time went on, Germanic tribes who had conquered the former provinces of the West \nRoman Empire, established small kingdoms, including the kingdoms of Ostrogoths in Italy, Visigoths in Spain, Franks in Gaul, Burgundians in western Germany, and the Saxons in England. German kings ruled their kingdoms according to tribal customs. But, at the same time, they preserved much of the Roman legacy. One of these Germanic kingdoms was the kingdom of the Franks which flourished in the former Roman province of Gaul (now France) since the end of the 5\nth century A.D. One of the Frankish kings, Charles Martel, founded \nthe Carolingian dynasty and consolidated its power in the 8th century. He was converted to \nChristianity and gained the support of his subjects in Gaul and a powerful ally in the pope of the Roman church. He rallied Frankish warriors and defeated Arabs from Spain at the Battle of Tours in 732 A.D. Because of this, although they continued to rule most of what is"

He built an empire that included what is now France, Germany and part of Italy. He established a strong and efficient government by copying the Roman system of central administration. Charlemagne, also named Charles the Great, spent much of his 46 years of reign fighting Muslims in Spain, Saxons in the north, Avars and Slavs in the east and Lombards in Italy. In 800 A.D Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne emperor of the Romans. Charlemagne also revived Latin learning as a means to unify his empire and created local schools. Together with the church, Charlemagne spread medieval Christian civilization into northern Europe. \nAfter Charlemagne’s death in 81 4 A.D, his successors struggled for power, and in 843 A.D, \nthe empire broke up into three independent kingdoms. The Frankish or Carolingian Empire also faced new waves of invasions. Muslim forces continued to pose a threat to Christian Europe. In 9 1 1 A.D, the Norman, who belonged to the Vikings from Scandinavia, settled in what is now Normandy in northern France and later most of southern Italy.  Since about 900 A.D the Magyars from Hungary have overrun Eastern Europe and plundered Germany, parts of France and Italy. Later, they were pushed back into Hungary, where they became ruling classes.\nActivity 4.1\n1. How did the fall of Rome affect Western Europe?\n2.

Main Features of the Middle Ages  \nMedieval Europe was feudal in its rural economy. Feudalism was a loosely organized sys -\ntem of rule in which powerful local lords divided their landholdings among lesser lords. In exchange, the lesser lords or vassals became loyal and gave service to the greater lord. The time when feudalism developed varied from place to place and its practice showed change over time. For instance, it developed as early as the 4\nth century in some parts of the Raman \nEmpire, where we can see dependent peasants called coloni. They were not slaves but gave labour service to their landlords and could not leave their land lords` land. This was very similar to the serf-lord relationship of the Middle Ages.  By contrast, in much of central and"

In Russia serfdom existed until 1861, when it was abolished. \nUnder the medieval rural feudal economy, a lord had a manor or several manors. The manor \n(lord`s estate) was at the center of medieval European economy. It was self-sufficient in that a manor produced almost everything needed by its people. Manors covered most of Europe during the Middle Ages. Peasants lived and worked on the manor. Most of them were serfs. The serfs belonged to the lord and they could not leave the manor without his permission. If the manor was granted to a new lord, the serfs went along with it. The lord kept part of the manor under his own direct control. This land was called demesne and was cultivated for the lord by the unpaid compulsory labour of his serfs. Peasants also paid feudal dues, in kinds like cheese, eggs, cloth, honey, etc. or in cash, to the lord. Besides, peasants paid fees when they used the lord`s wine press, flour mills and baking oven. They also repaired his fences, roads and bridges. A lord also had legal authority (jurisdiction) over his serfs. He or his agent could hear cases of crime and impose money fines as punishment or hang a serf in cases of serious crimes like murder. \nIn return for their labour and other payments, peasants were allowed to cultivate some of \nthe land of the manor to support themselves and their families. They were also given pro -\ntection by their lord from raids or warfare. Although they were not free to leave the manor without the permission of the lord, they could not be forced off the manor. \nThe feudal society in medieval Europe was sharply divided into two classes: the privileged \nupper class consisting of kings, nobles, higher clergy and knights; and the unprivileged low -\ner class, composed of the great mass of peasants or serfs. Hierarchical positions in feudal society were determined by birth. On top of the hierarchy was the king. Below the king stood the powerful lords who pledged allegiance and military service in return for the fiefs (plots of land) granted to them by him. This relationship was called Vassalage. Because kings were weak, local lords (nobles) assumed the functions of government within their territory. They made laws, levied taxes, dispensed justice and waged war. They governed people by their personal whim or desire. The great lords granted lands to the lesser lords, who were their vassals but more numerous than them, in exchange for allegiance and military service. The process could be repeated several times so that the lesser lords could grant their fief to other nobles."

            "text": "81Text Book\nPage\nPolitical and social hierarchy of Medieval Europe\nThe lowest and most numerous groups of nobles constituted the bulk of the feudal armies. \nIn the Early Middle Ages, cavalry became increasingly important in war. Kings and great lords needed men who were experienced at fighting on horseback, wearing armour, and carrying a shield, lance (spear) and sword. These men were called knights (mounted war -\nriors). In return for their military service, kings and great lords gave land to knights. The land provided material resources for knights, to equip themselves with horses, armour and weapons. In the Late Middle Ages (1350-1500 A.D) knights adopted a code of conduct (elaborate rules) called chivalry. Chivalry required knights to be brave, loyal and true to their word, and in warfare they had to fight fairly. Warriors also had to treat a captured knight well or even release him if he promised to pay his ransom. \nNoble women also played active roles in the medieval period warrior society. The lady \nof the manor took over the duties of her husband or father when he was away from the manor for a war. She supervised vassals, managed the household, and performed necessary agricultural and medical tasks. Sometimes, she might even have to go to war to defend her estate. A few medieval noble women were actively involved in politics particularly during the high (1000-1350) and late (1350-1500) Middle Ages. Women`s rights to inheritance were restricted under the feudal system. Land was usually passed to the eldest son in a family. Sometimes women did inherit fiefs, but a woman frequently received land as part of her dowry. \nThe peasants, or serfs, who were the largest group of people, were at the bottom of the \nsocial scale. Serfdom and corvee labour were imposed on them. After fulfilling his obliga -\ntions the serf had little left for his own family. He lived a hard-tedious life and had little opportunity for recreation and education. Vassalage was hereditary during the Middle Ages and serfs were deprived of social mobility. The peasants or serfs depended on the lord for protection from enemies, for justice and for what little government there was."

The church provided government services. During the 1 1\nth century, it became stronger, more independent and fully interfered in state \naffairs. For instance, in 1059, the College of Cardinals was created. Its job was to elect a successor to the pope who would be the choice of the church; not of a king or mob. Pope Innocent III (1 198-1216) claimed that his authority was above any other ruler and that the word of the church was final. Thus, the Roman Christian (later Catholic) church was also the largest land holder in Western Europe during the Middle Ages.  Rulers and many lords gave fiefs to the church in return for services performed by the clergy. Most bishops and other high-ranking clergymen were noblemen who devoted their lives to the church. They ruled large fiefs and lived much like other noblemen. \nThe manorial system began to decline when trade and towns revived. Trade and urban \nbusiness brought back an economic system based on money. Manorialism ended first in Western Europe. But it continued as late as the 19\nth century in some parts of central and \nEastern Europe. \nRevival of Trade and Towns\nAs the demand for goods increased, trade began to revive during the 1 1th century. Tows ap -\npeared along main trade routes. Most early towns developed near a fortified castle, church or monastery, where merchants could stop for protection. The location of natural resources was another factor for the growth of towns.\nMany people moved to towns in search of jobs. Peasants left the manors to seek a new \nlife. As cities grew in size, so did the variety of occupations carry out by their inhabitants. Weavers, shoemakers, bakers, butchers, carpenters, trailers, and other craftsmen flocked to the trading, fishing, and woolen towns. These craftsmen produced goods for merchants to sell to the town’s people. Some peasants farmed the land outside the towns and supplied the town`s people with food. Medieval towns, which arose mainly because of the growth of trade, encouraged craftsmanship and trading activities. By 1000 AD, merchants, traders and artisans formed a new social class called the middle class, ranked between nobles and peasants.\nIn medieval towns and cities, the guild system appeared. Merchant guilds (association of ar -\ntisans and merchants) appeared first. In time, artisans resented the powerful merchants and \norganized their own craft guilds. Each guild represented workers in one occupation, such"

Guilds made rules to protect their economic interests and the quality of their goods, regulate working hours, and set prices. Women engaged in crafts and trade, and might inherit the workshop of their husband or father if he died.  They dominated some trades and even had their own guilds. For instance, in Paris, women far outnumbered men in the profitable silk and wool guilds.  \nMedieval Culture: Art, Architecture and Education\nTown life encouraged a greater interest in art and learning. The gathering together of large numbers of people, the increase in trade and travel, and the freedom and security offered by cities and towns encouraged art and learning. The two most important achievements of the period were the building of cathedrals and the growth of universities. \nUntil the 12\nth century, most cathedrals erected in Western Europe followed the church \narchitecture style called Romanesque. This architectural style was first applied by the Ro-\nmans into the early Christian churches. Romanesque cathedrals had massive walls, strong columns and rounded arches. Later, a new style of architecture called Gothic developed. This new style of architecture had high towers and walls, pointed arches and leaning arches called flying butt recess. \n Figure 4.2 Romanesque Cathedral, Lund, Sweden              Gothic Cathedral, Milan, Italy\nArtists of many kinds applied their skills to the cathedrals. Expert wood workers carved panels on altars and pews. Sculptors cut stone statues of saints and martyrs, and chiseled out of stone devils and dragons called gargoyles.  Craftsmen who worked in stained glass created real beauty. Most cathedrals that stand to this day are 500 or more years old. \nThe Christian church played an important part in shaping the medieval period European \nformal education. It was mostly controlled by religious authorities. In the monastery and cathedral schools, students studied such subjects as church music, theology, and Latin (official language of the western church). They were also taught subjects similar to those"

Most European languages, except Greek and most Slav languages, adopted the Latin alphabet. Latin con -\ntinued to be the language of many parts of Europe. Modern languages like Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French and Rumanian developed from Latin. Many words of Latin origin are also found in the English language. \nThe first modern universities developed in Europe in the 1 100s. European universities were \nfirst developed not as institutions with collections of buildings. Instead, they began as collections of scholars organized into corporations (guilds or associations) with certain privileges and responsibilities. The University of Paris, which became the largest and most famous university in Europe during the 13\nth century, served as a model for the majority of \nnorthern European universities. Medieval universities used Latin as a teaching language. Most of the universities in northern Europe developed from teachers` guilds at cathedral schools. The teachers` guilds charged a fee to train students and to grant degrees. \nThe Crusades (1096-1270)\nThe Crusades were the successive expeditions organized by the Christians of Western Eu -\nrope to recapture Palestine (the Holy Land).  The Holy Land was important to Christians because it was the region where Jesus Christ lived. During the 1 1\nth century, Seljuk Turks from \ncentral Asia invaded the Near East and conquered Asia Minor (now Turkey), Palestine and Syria. The Turks crushed the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert in Asia Minor in 107 1. The Turks had become Muslims. But, unlike Muslim Arabs, they made it difficult for Christian pilgrims to reach the Holy Land. \nTherefore, in 1095, the Byzantine emperor Alexius I urgently asked Pope Urban II for \nChristian knights to help him fight the Muslim Turks. The Pope agreed, and at the Council of Clermont (1095), he gave a stirring sermon urging European Christians to stop fighting among themselves and recapture the Holy Land from Muslims. He promised the crusaders both spiritual and material rewards for their deeds. By 1096, thousands of knights were on their way to the Holy Land. As the crusading spirit spread across Western Europe, armies of ordinary men, women and children also left for the Holy Land. The term crusade comes from the Latin word crux, meaning cross. Members of the expeditions sewed the symbol of the cross of Christ on their clothing.  \nThe crusaders, who came from Western Europe and were assisted by those from Byzantine,"

Kings of France, Germany and England; nobles and thou -\nsands of knights; and peasants and town people took part in the crusades. The crusaders \nhad two stated goals: (1) to gain permanent control of the Holy Land and (2) to protect the Byzantine Empire. Religious zeal was not the only factor that motivated the crusaders. The French knights wanted more wealth and land. Italian merchants intended to involve, and then, if possible, to control the trade of Middle Eastern ports. The pope wanted to increase his power, reduce the East-West division of the church and hoped that knights would fight Muslims instead of one another. Many priests and monks wanted valuable religious relics. A large number of poor people joined the expeditions simply to escape the hardships of their lives.\nThe Crusaders failed to accomplish their main goals. The Christian knights of the first cru-\nsade recaptured Jerusalem in 1099, but could not establish lasting control over the area. In 1 187 Jerusalem fell to the Muslims led by an able leader named Salah al-Din (known to the Europeans as Saladin). In the third crusade led by the German Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa), King Richard I (the Lion Hearted) of England and King Philip II (Augustus) of France, Christians failed to retake Jerusalem. After negotiation, however, Salah al-Din did reopen the holy city to Christian pilgrims. \nDuring the fourth crusade the crusaders fought other christians instead of the muslims.

Trade increased and expanded between cities that bordered the Mediterranean Sea. West Europeans learnt how to make better ships. Merchants from Venice and other northern Italian cities had built large fleets and transported the crusaders. Later, they used these fleets to carry on trade in goods such as sugar, cotton and rice with the Middle East. The crusades facilitated money economy. Nobles and knights collected taxes from peasants in cash instead of grain to support their journey to the Holy Land. Hence, peasants began to sell goods in town to earn money for their taxes. This practice helped to undermine serfdom in Europe. The crusades also increased the revenues and prestige of monarchs and the power of the pope. West Europeans made more accurate maps from their experience in the crusades and began to use magnetic compasses to give directions. The crusades also increased the curiosity of West Europeans to new places in the east. In 127 1 a young Venetian named Marco Polo, with his merchant father and uncle, travelled to China and stayed there for many years. Up on his return to Venice, he wrote a book about the wonders of Chinese civilization.

About Sunni and Shi`ia Islam?\n•\tWhy do Muslims consider Mecca sacred?\n4.3.1. The Rise and Expansion of Islam\nIslam is a religion preached in Arabia by Muhammed in the 7th century A.D. He was born \nin Mecca about 570 A.D.  Muhammed preached that there is only one God; that is, Allah, \nand he, Mohammed, was His messenger. Islam is an Arabic word for submission to the will of Allah, and Muslims are those who believe in this preaching. Islam is a religion and a way of life. Muslims believe that the Quran, the holy scriptures of Islam, is the word of Allah as revealed to Muhammed the Prophet.\nMuhammed began his preaching in Mecca around 610 A.D, and gathered around him a \nsmall community of followers. Soon, the Quraysh Arabs and wealthy merchants in Mecca considered his teachings as a threat to their privileges. There was a fear that Mecca might lose its importance as the center of traditional religion because of the new preaching. The annual pilgrimage to the Ka`aba (holy shrine in Mecca) by Arabs from all over Arabia has been a source of considerable income for the merchants of Mecca. Thus, Muhammed and his followers faced persecution, and several attempts were made to kill him. Because of this, in 622 A.D Muhammed and his followers retreated into the town of Yatrib, later renamed as Madinat al-Nabi (city of the Prophet) or Medina.  This event is known as Hijira (retreat) and the Muslim era dates from the Hijira by which 622 became year one in Islamic calendar \nThe inhabitants of Medina came to be known as the Ansars (Helpers), and those who \nundertook the Hijira were known as Muhajirun (Emigrants). These two groups formed the Sahaba (the companions of the Prophet). They formed the Umma (community of Muslims). Muhammed created rules that governed and united Muslims. In 630 A.D, after fighting"

He re -\ndedicated the Ka`aba to Allah and it became the most holy place in Islam. In the next two \nyears, Muhammed worked to unite the Arabs under Islam, and established control over much of Arabia through both diplomacy and war. He died in 632 A.D, but the faith that he proclaimed continued to spread. \nThe prophet`s immediate successors were called caliphs. The first four caliphs were Abu \nBakr (632-34 A.D), Umar (634-44 A.D), ‘Uthman (644-56 A.D) and Ali (656-61 A.D), all of whom were tied to the Prophet through marriage. When the third caliph, ‘Uthman, was murdered by a group of Muslims who had revolted because they were offended by some of his policies, Ali was elected caliph (Imam) of Medina. His election was not however ac -\ncepted by some of the companions, particularly Muawya, governor of Syria. This resulted in a civil war between the followers of Ali and those of Muawiya. Ali agreed to the formation of an arbitration committee of two members, one representing him and the other Muawiya. But many of Ali`s followers rejected the idea of arbitration and abandoned him. They came to be known as Kharijites (those who withdrew). They, at the same time, revolted against Muawiya. Eventually, Ali was murdered in 661 A.D by the followers of Muawiya. \nBefore his death, the Prophet had practiced and indicated that governing the community \nshould be based on Shura (mutual consultation). When he died, Muslims disagreed about who should be chosen to be the leader of the community. One group of Muslims felt that Muhammed had designated his son- in-law, Ali (husband of Fatima), as his successor. They were known as Shi’at Ali (the party of Ali) or Shi`ites. The Shi`tes rejected the consensus of the community and replaced it with the doctrine that there was in every age an infallible Imam to whom alone Allah entrusted the guidance of humankind. They preferred the term Imamate to caliphate and Imam to caliph. The first Imam was Ali. Another group felt that any pious male Muslim from Muhammed`s tribe could lead the community since there could be no prophet after Muhammed. This successor, called a caliph, was without any divine (prophetic) functions. They were called Sunnis because they followed the Sunna, that is, the way of the prophet. From the struggle among Muslims the Sunnis emerged victorious. \nLike the split between Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians, the division be -\ntween Sunni and Shi`ite Muslims has survived to the present day, with profound impact on \nlater Islamic history. Today, Sunnis or Sunnites comprise 90% of the world`s total Muslim population. Most Shi`ite live in Iran, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. The major doctrinal differ -\nences between Sunni and Shi`ite Islam are the followings: the sources of Sunnite law are the Quran, the Hadith, the consensus of the community and analogy.

Besides, Sunni Islam accepts the belief in the coming of the Mahdi (the rightly guided one) who restores justice. Through the centuries Mahdis appeared in various countries from time to time.  \nThe Kharijites also developed into a religious sect and revolted against the caliphs and \ncentral governments of the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties in Iraq, Arabia and Iran in the course of the 7\nth and 8th centuries. They insisted that anyone, even a black slave, could be \nelected as the head of the community if he had the necessary qualifications: piety, integri -\nty and religious knowledge. They also asserted that anyone guilty of a serious sin was an unbeliever and an apostate, and should therefore be put to death. Nevertheless, the Khar -\nijites were not supported by the majority of Muslims because of their religious intolerance towards other Muslims. Therefore, they remained minorities in the eastern lands of the ca -\nliphate. In the Maghrib (northwest Africa), the Kharijites had considerable followers among the Berbers who were dissatisfied with the oppressive Umayyad regime. \nIslamic law governs the daily lives of Muslims around the world, and Islamic traditions in -\nfluence ethical behaviour and family relations. Muslim scholars developed the Sharia. The \nterm Sharia refers to a body of Islamic law that includes the interpretation of the Quran, examples of behaviour from Muhammed`s life, and Muslim traditions. It applies all religious principles to all legal situations that govern every aspect of individual and community life. Islamic religion also ensured spiritual equality of all Muslims and gave rights and protection to women. Islam encouraged education for men and women so that all Muslims could study the Holy Quran.\nIn the course of the 8\nth and 9th centuries, different interpretations of what Islamic law \nshould be were reflected in the emergence of different fiqh (schools of thought) or ways of \nstudying and practicing Islam. Within Sunni and Shi’a Islam there are six main schools of Islamic law. The Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi and Hanbali schools of thought belong to Sunni Islam. The Zaydi and Ja`fari are the two important Sh`a schools in Shi`te Muslim countries. The Hanafi School is dominant in Turkey, Syria, Iraq, central Asia and northern India/Pakistan. The Maliki School has followers in North Africa, Muslim Spain and western and central Sudan. The Shafi School is found in areas along the Indian Ocean from South Arabia and East Africa to Indonesia. The Hanbali was formerly dominant in Syria and Iraq, but now it is restricted only to Saudi Arabia. In Ethiopia, the Shafi and Hanafi Schools of Islamic law are dominant."

To which sect did the above caliphs/Imam belong?\nThe Rise of Islamic Empire\nMuslim Arabs expanded outside Arabia under the first four caliphs. Motivated by economic \nand political objectives, the Muslim Arabs won a series of victories over the Byzantine and Persian armies. They crushed the Byzantine army and occupied Syria and Palestine, including Jerusalem in the campaign of 634 to 636 A.D.  Arab armies also occupied Byzantine Egypt between 639 and 642 A.D. The Battle of Qadisiyya in 637 opened the fertile lowlands of Iraq to Muslim Arabs. From their military bases of Basra and Kufa, Arab armies penetrated the Iranian highlands. The last great battle at Nihawand (642) ended the Persian Empire. By 650 A.D, they reached the borders of India, northern Iraq and Armenia (central Asia). \nThe rapid successes of Muslim Arab armies were due to the mutual exhaustion of the \nByzantine and Persian empires as a result of long wars. Besides, the Byzantines were hated by their subjects because of their harsh taxation. The Christian population in Iran hated the Persian ruling class because of religious differences. The Persian Empire had also been weakened by dynastic wars before the conquest by the Arabs.  The sense of unity Islam had created among its followers and the desire to glorify the new religion led the Muslim armies to victory. \nAfter the murder of Ali in 661 A.D, Muawiya founded a new caliphate called Umayyad \n(661-750 A.D). Muawiya was a member of the aristocratic Meccan family of Umayyah, from which the caliphate took its name. The Umayyads transferred the capital from Medina to the ancient city of Damascus in Syria. Muslim Arab armies under the Umayyad caliphs won new victories. They fought Turkish tribes in central Asia, sent an expedition into Sindh in India and reached the borders of China. They also captured Sicily and completed the conquest of North Africa. The Umayyads then invaded Spain in 7 1 1 A.D.\nWithin one hundred years since the death of the Prophet, Muslim Arabs established an \nempire that included enormous territory. They brought many non-Arab peoples under their rule. Early Umayyads imposed a special tax on non-Muslims which was vital to support Arab troops. They allowed Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians to practice their own faith and"

But to govern their empire, the Umayyads often relied on local officials. Many non-Muslims played key roles as officials and tax collectors, doc -\ntors, translators and tutors at the court. Many others have embraced Islam. In later centuries, Turkish and Mongol converts helped spread Islam across Asia, as the Berbers did in North and West Africa. An enormous amount of wealth flowed into Umayyad hands in the form of tax and tribute. \nEventually, the contradictions between the politically and economically privileged minority \nand the unprivileged majority led to the downfall of the Umayyad dynasty and the estab-lishment of another dynasty by the Abbasids.  The leader of the Abbasid revolution was Abu al-Abbas, who had descent from the Prophet. Supported by dissatisfied elements mostly of Shi`ites and non- Arab Muslims, he captured Damascus in 750 A.D. Abu al-Ab -\nbas then established the Abbasid dynasty centered in Baghdad, which lasted until 1258.  \nMap 4.3 The Islamic Empire during the Abbasid Caliphate\nUnder the early Abbasids, the Arab military upper class lost its privileges, discrimination against non-Arab Muslims ended, the caliphate reached its greatest wealth and power and Muslim civilization flourished. Arabic continued to be the language of the state, literature and science. By 820 A.D. the power of the Abbasids was so extensive that it was felt throughout the Islamic empire. \nHowever, by 920 A.D, the power of the caliph had already diminished. There were internal \nand external factors for the gradual decline and collapse of the Abbasid caliphate. The internal factor was most important. The conquered people were exploited and overtaxed."

In Egypt, Persia, Tunisia, the Maghreb and Spain independent dynasties emerged. Externally, the Sel -\njuk Turks from central Asia expanded and established a vast empire. They became Muslims and controlled Baghdad making the Caliph the figure head of the Seljuk Sultan.  The threat the Seljuk posed to the Byzantine Empire also led to the Crusades. In February 1258 Mon -\ngol troops led by Hulagu (grandson of Genghis Khan) burned and looted Baghdad to the ground, killing the last Abbasid caliph and his officials. The fall of Baghdad marked the end of the caliphate. \nLegacy of Muslim Civilization\nIslamic civilization was in its “golden age” between 800 and 1200 A.D. It absorbed the traditions of many cultures and embraced all the people who lived under Muslim rule. Medieval Islamic civilization borrowed freely from the Greeks, Persians and Hindus. Arabs, Jews, Persians, Turks, Egyptians, Berbers and Spaniards all contributed to the development of medieval Muslim culture. But it was at the same time creative and original. Moreover, Islam provided it with a general framework and a universal language. Arabic grammar, law and theology are some aspects of civilization with a typically Muslim character. \nMerchants were respected in Muslim culture. Between 750 and 1350, Muslim merchants \nbuilt a vast trading network across the Muslim empire and even beyond. Muslim merchants served as agents for the spread of products, technologies, knowledge and culture. They expanded money economy. Muslim Arabs were also especially interested in agriculture. Therefore, both the Umayyad and Abbasid rulers took steps to preserve and extend agri -\ncultural land by organizing massive irrigation projects. Muslim scholars wrote treatises on the means of improving the soil and promoting the growth of trees, vegetables and fruits. Farmers cultivated food crops (dates and grain) as well as cash crops, including sugar cane, cotton, medical herbs and flowers. Settled farmers and the mobile nomads of the deserts still maintained economic ties. Nomads bought food items from farmers, while settled com -\nmunities obtained meat, wool, hides and pack animals from pastoral nomads. \nGreat advances were made in the fields of mathematics, astronomy, botany, chemistry, med -\nicine, history and geography in the Islamic world. Both boys and girls received elementary \neducation which emphasized reading and writing skills to study the Quran. Schools of religious instruction and Islamic law offered higher level learning.

They also preserved ancient culture by translating Persian, Sanskrit, and Greek \ntexts into Arabic.\nInspired by their works, Muslim scholars translated the works of Greek philosophers, as well \nas Hindu and Budhist texts. Hellenstic philosophy also flourished in several Middle Eastern schools including the Academy of Alexanderia in Egypt and the great medical school of Jundi-Shapur in Iran. Among others, In Cordoba, the philosopher Ibn Rushd (known in Europe as Averroes) put all knowledge, except the Quran,  to the test of reason. \nMuslim mathematicians made important advances in algebra, plane and apherical trigo -\nnometry, and the geometry of planes, spheres, cones and cylinders. Arabic numerals were \nof Hindu invention, but Arabs introduced them to Europe. Muslim scholars introduced the decimal fraction. They applied their mathematical knowledge to business accounting (banks were established in Baghdad and other cities as early as the 9\nth century), land survey, \nastronomical calculations and mechanical devices. \nIn medicine and public health, Muslims built on the works of ancient Greeks. Hunayn ibn Ishaq (d. 873) developed the science of optics. Physicians studied botany and chemistry in order to discover curative drugs and remedying various poisons. The government set up hospitals where injured and sick people could get treatment. Physicians also traveled to rural areas to treat people who could not get into cities. It was Muhammad al-Razi (865-925), a leading Persian physician at Baghdad`s chief hospital, who wrote many books on medicine including his inventive study on smallpox from measles. Another Persian physician, Ibn Sina, known in Europe as Avecina, (d. 1037) was a doctor to the Persian nobility. His scientific writing was the Canon on Medicine which was a medical encyclopedia translated into Latin and remained a standard text book for European medical students until the 17\nth century. \nScientists and mathematicians have made great advances in the field of astronomy. Mus -\nlims, like other peoples, thought that heavenly bodies affected the lives of people, cities \nand states. So, many caliphs kept court astrologers as advisers. Muslim scientists also used astrolabes (devices for measuring the height of stars) and built primitive versions of the telescope. They observed the movements of stars and the earth. Muslim scientists knew that the earth was round and that it revolved around the sun, long before Copernicus or Galileo. \nDescriptive geography and history were favourable subjects.

Muslims histo -\nrians also liked to read the accounts of the  early caliphs and their conquests for instruction as well as amusement. Medieval Muslim historians were the first to try to structure history by looking for patterns in the rise and fall of dynasties, peoples and civilizations. Above all, the philosopher and historiographer from Tunisia, Ibn Khaldun (1332-1 406), set the rules for the scientific study of history. He emphasized economic and social factors as causes of historical events. Ibn Khaldun also wrote about the common mistakes of historians in writing history, such as bias, exaggeration, and overconfidence in the accuracy of sources.

The term Ottoman \ncomes from the name Osman or Othman I (r. 1299-1324) who was the founder and first Sultan of the Ottoman Turkish state and the dynasty that ruled it.  Starting from 1280, the Ottomans spread across Asia Minor and the Balkan region in Eastern Europe. Ottoman expansion threatened the declining Byzantine Empire. Ottoman cannon and musket military technology outdated the Byzantine mounted warriors and played the greatest role for the success of Ottoman army. Ottoman canons blasted the defensive walls of Constantinople. In 1 453 Sultan Mehmet II, the Conqueror (r. 1 45 1-1 481) took control of the city.

His power was only limited by the need to make his policies and decisions agree with Sha -\nria, as interpreted by Muslim clerics and the Ulema. Below the Sultan was a chief minister called the grandvizier, who, also sometimes commanded the army.  When Ottoman Sultans were less capable, particularly after Suleiman I, it was strong and competent Grand Viziers and their officials who held the empire together. \nOttoman army was large and efficient. The infantry of Janissaries was the regular, professional and \ncore of the Ottoman army. They were recruited from the regular tribute in Christian children paid by Christian families in the Balkans, and brought up as Muslims and highly trained as the best soldiers at the palace school. The Janissaries were respected and feared by the enemies of the Ottomans for their skill, discipline, courage and fanaticism. The Ottomans created this efficient infantry elite force in the early decades of the 15\nth century. It was armed with muskets and cannons. Another division of the \nOttoman army was the Sipahi Turkish cavalry.  It was composed holders of timars (fiefs) granted by the Sultan in Asia Minor and Europe. Turkish cavalry was required to arm itself with horses and weapons using the resources obtained from timars. Ottoman timars became hereditary and were much like medieval European fiefs. There was in fact a military feudalism in the Ottoman Empire quite similar to Medieval Western Europe.  \nThe expansive Ottoman Empire with its powerful and well-disciplined army and good navy was a dan-\ngerous enemy to European states, which were divided and often at war with each other. However, after the death of Sultan Suleiman I in 1566, the Ottoman Empire began to gradually decline. Ottoman economic and military decline from the 17\nth century onwards made the empire weak and less danger -\nous to Europeans.

By 605 A.D, Sui rulers rebuilt the Grand Canal that linked the Yangtze (Huang He) River in south China with the Chang River in north China. For centuries, the canal made grain and other products of the south easily available to support the political and military needs of the north.  4.3.3. The Dynastic Cycle in China\nA number of dynasties have ruled China since ancient times. But between each dynasty, \nthere was always a period of disunity. The Chinese believed that the rise, period of rule, and fall of governments or dynasties was determined by the “Mandate of Heaven”. This was the idea that heaven gave the monarch the mandate, or right, to rule over China.  Accordingly, each Chinese dynasty rose to political power, achieved prosperity; and then, because of corruption, lost the Mandate of Heaven and fell down.

The Tang period was \nan age of prosperity and great cultural accomplishments. The first emperor of the dynasty was Li Yuan (r. 618-626 A.D). His successors conquered territories deep into central Asia and expanded the empire. Tang capital, Chang`an (now Xian), was the largest city in the world. It attracted diplomats, traders, poets, scholars and students from all over Asia and the Mediterranean area. Some of China`s great poets like Li Bao or Li Po (701-7 62) and Du Fu (7 12-770) wrote during the Tang period. Buddhism had an enormous cultural influence, but followers adopted it to Chinese ways of life. But in the 9\nth century A.D a revival of Con -\nfucianism began. \nTang Emperors strengthened the government by restoring the Han system of uniform gov -\nernment throughout China.

Chinese economy expanded because of improved farming methods and an open border trade policy. More and more people were involved in commerce, learning, and arts. Foreign trade flourished as merchants from India, Persia and Arabia frequented Chinese markets. Song period merchants also travelled to South East Asia to exchange goods for spices and special woods. Song period Chinese inventions include gunpowder, magnetic compass, and movable type of printing. Art, philosophy and literature flourished. \nThe Song dynasty suffered from frequent attacks by nomadic people from the north. In \n1 126, it lost northern China to invaders from Manchuria. The Song moved their capital from Kaiteng to Hangzhou in the wealthy lower Yangtze Delta, and the dynasty became known as the Southern Song. For several decades, since the early 13\nth century, Mongol warriors from \nthe north attacked and eventually conquered northern China. In March 1279, for the first time in the history of China, organized resistance ceased, and Mongol invaders controlled the whole Chinese Empire. \nThe Mongol leader, Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, established the Yuan Dynasty \n(r. 1279-1368) and ruled China up to 1294.  He established the walled city of Khanbaliq (now Bejing) as his capital, and ruled all of China, Tibet and Korea. Mongols formed the upper-level ruling class, while provincial and other lower-level posts were seized by Chinese officials. Kublai Khan welcomed many foreigners to his court including the Venetian trader Marco Polo (1254-1324) in 1275. Marco polo spent 17 years in Kublai Khan`s service. Up on his return to Venice in 1292, Marco Polo wrote a vivid account of the wealth and civilization of China which he called Cathay. The Moroccan Muslim traveler, Ibn Battuta (1304-1369) also visited the Yuan court in 1345 as an envoy to the Sultan of Delhi.

However, other characteristics of a capitalist society such as the legal equality of all citizens did not come in most of Europe until after the French Revolution of 1789. \n4.4.1. Development of Towns and Long-Distance Trade\nIn the period between c. 1000 and c. 1300, towns and cities grew in size and number, and long distance and other trade expanded. Capitalist relations developed most quickly in ur-ban centers and in connection with the long-distance trade conducted by the merchants of these urban centers. The smallest towns had between 500-2000 inhabitants. Larger urban centers had between 2000-10,000 people, while great cities had between 20,000 and 30,000 inhabitants. Some great cities like Venice in Italy and Paris in France probably had a population of 100, 000. \nTowns and cities were centers of different economic activities. All of them provided a market \nfor the sale of goods. The countryside sold food to the towns and the towns sold manufac -\ntured goods to the countryside. The merchants of bigger urban centers also engaged in long distance trade across state frontiers and even outside Europe to the Muslim lands of the Mediterranean. Towns and cities were also the centers of manufactories, conducted in small craft workshops. In the bigger urban centers, merchants organized into merchant guilds and sold their products in distant markets. The craft workers were dominated by these merchant capitalists and many of the craft workers were wage workers. Some towns and cities have developed famous industrial specialties like the luxury woolen cloth of Flanders in Belgium. \nTowns and cities were also the centers of local administration by feudal lords and royal \nadmiration by kings. In addition to this, urban centers were religious and cultural centers."

As money economy in -\ncreased in Europe, banks appeared in some Italian cities. Some rich merchants lent money at interest and, through their agents all over Europe, they helped to finance trade. \nAs towns and cities became richer, the bigger towns gained the right to self-administration \nby their own officials. This right was gained by payment to a feudal lord or bishop or king, and sometimes by hard struggle. The greatest cities like Venice in Italy became completely independent city republics. In Germany important cities were “free cities” under the German Emperor and were able to manage their own affairs with almost no outside control. There was no serfdom in towns and cities. “City air is free air” was a German saying at the time. \nTowns and cities were mostly surrounded by walls for defense and for collecting taxes at \nthe gates. Their administration was controlled by the richest citizens (bourgeoisie), usually merchants. During the late “Middle Ages”, the bourgeoisie were growing in number and wealth, but they were not as rich or as politically and socially powerful as the big nobles.

It was a period during which Europe began exploring \nnew areas of the world by sea in search of new trading routes,  wealth, and knowledge.In the \n15th century, there was high demand in Europe for goods originating from the east such as \njewels, porcelain, silk, and cinnamon, cloves, pepper and other spices.  But Ottoman Turks, \nwho controlled all the land and sea routes charged higher prices on these goods. Thus, the major trading nations of the period particularly Portugal and Spain wanted to bypass the Ottomans and Arabs who had controlled the routes.  \nThere were other additional factors that motivated European sailors to explore new areas. \nOne of such factors is that the tales and strange, exciting stories about distant places in the east increased the curiosity of Europeans about fabulous wealth of the east. The Venetian Marco Polo had told strange, exciting stories about how he had traveled to distant lands in Asia and had become rich. There was also the “legend about Prester John of Indies”, a rich Christian king who ruled somewhere in Asia or Africa, which has disseminated across Europe since the crusades. \nThe other more important factor was the development of more efficient wind driven sailing \nships and availability of navigation instruments like the compass, the quadrant and astro -\nlabe that made long distance voyages across oceans possible for European seamen. The new knowledge that the winds of the globe seasonally blow in a regular pattern across the oceans of the world also made regular oceanic voyages possible. \nThe last, but not least, factor for the development of European exploration during the 15\nth \nand 16th centuries, was the encouragement provided by the Portuguese prince, Henry the \nNavigator (r. 1394-1 460). He wanted to expand Portugal`s trade along the African coast. \nHe also hoped to find the source of gold that Islamic traders had been carrying north from West Africa across the Sahara Desert for hundreds of years. Henry devoted himself to train-ing and equipping explorers. He brought the ablest sea captains, mapmakers, astronomers, and mathematicians that he could find. He helped to build better ships. Prince Henry also opened a school in Southern Portugal for the leaders of his many expeditions. \nDuring the first half of the 15\nth century, Portuguese sailors set foot and occupied West Afri -\ncan islands and eventually reached the southern tip of Africa which they named the Cape \nof Good Hope. In 1 497- 98, Vasco da Gama sailed to India round the Cape and returned back. He opened the “Cape route” round Africa and across the Indian Ocean to the East."

Spain also dreamed of finding new trade routes to the Far East. Christopher Columbus, an Italian in the service of the Spanish mon -\narchy, made his first journey in 1 492. He was trying to sail round the world to reach India, China and the Far East. He did not know that the American continents were across his route. On his first and later voyages, Columbus had in fact reached not the East as he thought, but the West Indies (Caribbean islands) and coastal areas of main land of the American con -\ntinents. Other Spanish voyages soon confirmed that a new continent had been discovered by Columbus. His journeys opened the door for the Spanish conquest of the Americas. In the early 16\nth century, Spanish adventurers such as Hernan Cortes and Francisco Pizarro \ndestroyed the Aztecs of Mexico, the Incas of Peru, and other indigenous peoples of the Americas. By the end of the Age of Exploration in the 17\nth century, Spanish America in the \n“New World” extended from what are now Southwestern United States to the southernmost reaches of Chile and Argentina.

He and his crew continued the voyage through a passage to the pacific a passage known ever since as the Strait of Magellan. Magellan named the ocean Pacific, across which he and his crew sailed, and then reached the Philippines where Magellan was killed in April 1521. The Victoria, one of the five ships, with the surviving members of the crew, finally reached Spain on Sept 6, 1522 nearly 3 years after the voyage had begun."

Great \nBritain and France began to explore new trade routes and lands across the ocean. In 1 497 , John Cabot, an Italian explorer working for the English, reached what is believed to be the coast of Newfoundland. A number of French and English explorers followed, including Giovanni da Verrazano, who discovered the entrance to the Hudson River in 1524, and Henry Hudson, who mapped the island of Manhattan first in 1609.  \nIn the 17\nth century, the French, Dutch and British rivaled for dominance in the New World. \nEngland established the first permanent colony in North America at Jamestown in 1607 . \nSamuel du Champlain founded Quebec City in 1608 for France, and Holland established a trading outpost in New Amsterdam (now New York City) in 1624. \nThe Spanish and Portuguese empires and British colonies in the New World were basically \n“settlement colonies”. By the early 17\nth century, permanent settlements and colonies were \ncreated in the New World. In Brazil, Caribbean Islands and part of North America, planta-tion colonies were also established by European settlers, and worked by slave labour. World trade grew rapidly, which led to a “Commercial Revolution” that brought great changes. \nPortugal was more interested in developing a network of profitable trading posts in Africa \nand Asia than in colonizing the New World. In the 16\nth century, they established trading \nposts in Asia, and controlled most of the profitable trade in the Far East. However, in 1580 Portugal was annexed by Spain for about sixty years. Thus, Portuguese colonies, except Ma -\ncao and Goa, were taken over by other European nations particularly the ambitious Dutch. The Dutch also controlled the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), while the British East India Company controlled most of the trade in India. British control over India was nearly complete by 17 63. The French also had a few trading posts in India. This created a network of communication and trade, therefore, largely ending the need to search for new routes. \nBut it is important to note that exploration did not cease entirely at this time.

This led to a period of great intellectual and artistic creativity, known as the Renaissance meaning “rebirth” of classical culture. The Renaissance is often considered as one of the great turning points in the history of Western civilization.\nThe Renaissance began in Italy in part because of its strategic location on the Mediterranean \nSea. As trade between Asia and Europe increased, the cities of Italy emerged as centers of banking, commerce and handicrafts. Genoa, Pisa, and Venice became important centers of Mediterranean trade. As home to the Popes, Rome collected revenues from throughout Europe. The city states of Milan, Florence, and Siena grew wealthy from banking, farming, and making goods. Italian city-states also flourished because no single ruler, as in France, had united the peninsula and crushed their independence.\nThe Renaissance emerged in Italy, also because Italy was the center of classical civilization. \nScholars were as impressed by the remains of ancient civilizations as the achievements of pre-Christian artists and thinkers. Like the ancient Greeks, Renaissance thinkers believed in the power of human reason to explain the world. They looked at man as the focus of all things. Humanists placed great emphasis on the dignity, worth, and uniqueness of each person. \nDuring the Renaissance, wealthy Italian merchants and nobles acted as patrons supporting \nartists, writers and scholars. Secularism increased as people began to show a greater interest in this world than in the life after death. People used observation and experience to explain the world, rather than simply relying on traditional Church teachings.\nRenaissance artists, architects, scholars, writers, and scientists created a legacy of achieve -\nment that still influences us today. First, we will look at the artistic impact, mainly on painting \nand sculpture. Before the Renaissance, art in Italy was greatly influenced by Byzantine styles. Religious paintings were highly decorative, often with gold and jewels, but they appeared flat and lifelike. Figures often floated in space without shadows. The size of a figure was based on its importance, not where it was placed in the picture. In the 1300s, the painter Giotto (1267- 1337) had already astonished Italians by painting in an entirely new style, using scenes with figures in not lifelike space. Giotto’s figures were given depth by realistic shading, and showed emotions and gestures. During the Renaissance, each generation of"

Masaccio (1 401-1 428) and other artists also introduced shadows and other realistic effects.\nItalian painting reached its peak during the “High Renaissance” with the paintings of Leon -\nardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael. Leonardo Da Vinci (1 452- 15 19) was a sculptor \nand inventor as well as the painter of such works as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. Da Vinci discovered how to use shadows and blurred lines, especially on the eyes and mouth, to make his subjects appear incredibly lifelike. Da Vinci also had one of the best scientific minds of his time that he dissected human corpses in order to understand human anatomy. His notebooks include designs for a parachute and machine gun. Michelangelo (1 475-1564) was a Florentine artist. His major sculptures, such as David, Moses, and the Pieta, were startlingly realistic, just like the paintings of the time. Each sculpture was carved from a single slab of marble. His giant mural painting of Bible scenes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome is considered one of the greatest works of art of all time. Michelangelo’s sculptures and paintings equally glorified the human form.\nRenaissance architects studied the ruins of buildings from ancient Rome to develop a new \nRenaissance style. They abandoned the pointed arches and ornamentation of the Middle Ages. They used the columns and circular arches of ancient architecture for a simpler classical style. In early Renaissance Florence, citizens built a large cathedral but did not know how to complete its giant roof. They held a competition among architects. Filippo Brunelleschi, who had studied Roman buildings, was chosen as the winner. He developed a dome that created an immense interior space. At the time, the cathedral in Florence was the largest church in the world. These accomplishments in art demonstrated the Renaissance fascination with this world rather than the next, as well as the technical achievements pos -\nsible from the application of reason.\nThe period of the renaissance had remarkable impact on intellectual life such as learning \nand literature. Renaissance humanists studied classical Roman and Greek literature, poetry and philosophy. The Italian scholar Petrarch, the “Father of Humanism,” collected and stud -\nied ancient texts. New methods of criticizing texts led some, like Erasmus, to question the Church. Other Renaissance authors wrote on secular (non-religious) subjects. Renaissance writers described the dignity of man, celebrated the pleasures of the senses and instructed nobles in how to behave at a prince’s court. Many writers, like Boccaccio, wrote in the vernacular (local) language instead of Latin. As the Renaissance spread, writers such as Rabelais in France,"

The Church \ntaught that the Earth was the center of the universe. Nicholas Copernicus (1 473 -1 453), a Polish scientist, took careful measurements that led him to conclude that the Earth orbited the sun. Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), a famous Italian scientist, laid the foundation for modern physics. His observations with one of the first telescopes strengthened his belief in Copernicus’ theory. \nJohann Gutenberg developed a printing press with movable type in Germany around 1 450. \nGutenberg created individual letters of metal, which were held together in a frame. The in -\nvention of movable type, along with the use of a special press and oil-based inks, allowed the mass production of printed books for the first time. This encouraged the spread of new ideas. More people also began to learn to read.\nThe renaissance also had far-reaching political impacts. Niccolo Machiavelli was a courtier \nand politician in the city state of Florence. His book, The Prince, was a guidebook in how to secure and maintain political power. Machiavelli argued that the most successful rulers were not those who acted according to laws or conscience, but those who were willing to do whatever was necessary to hold power: “the end justifies the means.”\nThe wealth of the Italian city-states, the weakening of the Church and the reasoning of \nwriters like Machiavelli contributed to the Renaissance concept of “reason of state.” Rulers justified taking whatever measures they needed to strengthen their state in order to survive. They collected taxes and raised armies, often by hiring professional soldiers. They also ex -\nchanged ambassadors creating modem diplomacy. Rulers in larger states like France soon copied these practices.\nNo less was the contribution that this period made in economic life. People strove to im-\nprove their material conditions, while the wealthy accumulated more luxury goods. This encouraged an increase in trade, a greater variety of products (especially clothes, foods, wine and furnishings) and the growth of cities."

There were multiple causes for the Reformation. The spirit of inquiry of the Renais -\nsance, as well as knowledge of the widespread corruption of the Church, led to new chal -\nlenges to the Pope’s authority. There were also oppositions against church taxes and church tax exemptions. Some educated people who were influenced by the Renaissance ideas, doubted church authority and church teachings on astronomy, history and Bible interpre -\ntation. There were also criticisms against some church practices, such as worldliness and nepotism which seemed unworthy of church leaders. People like Erasmus (1 466-1536) in Holland and Sir Thomas Moore (1 478-1535) in England sought reform within the Catholic Church, but Church leaders were slow to respond.  \nIn 15 17 , protests against Catholic church abuses transformed into a full-scale revolt. The \nleader of the reformation movement was a German, Martin Luther (1 483-1546). Luther was educated and entered a Catholic monastic order. He assumed professorship in theo -\nlogical studies at the University of Wittenberg. Luther condemned the sale of indulgences by the Catholic Church; that is, accepting money for church pardons, without requiring true repentance. \nIn the same year, Luther posted on the door of the church at Wittenberg a statement of his"

Luther denied \nthe Pope`s supremacy and proclaimed that the Bible is the final authority. He criticized a number of Catholic practices. He also developed the doctrine of justification by faith; that is, only through faith in God could a person be saved and go to Heaven.\nTherefore, in1521, Luther was excommunicated by the Pope and faced punishment from \nCharles V, the Holy Roman Emperor (r. 15 19-1556). Luther responded to the Pope’s con -\ndemnation by establishing the Lutheran Church. He translated the New Testament into German and wrote a number of pamphlets to persuade others. He urged each individual to read and understand the Bible.\nThe reformers became known as Protestants, and their new religion Lutheranism. Many \nGerman princes adopted Protestantism and gave protection to Luther. They also used this as an opportunity to seize Church lands and close monasteries. When German peasants rebelled in 1524-1525, Luther sided with the princes. He had criticized the Pope, but he supported secular authority.\nLutheranism soon expanded to Scandinavian countries such as Norway, Sweden, and Den -\nmark, and became an official state religion. This was completed by the end of the 16\nth cen-\ntury. Other reformers also helped spread Lutheranism to several other countries. The French \nreligious reformer, John Calvin (1509-1564), became a leading protestant spokesperson in Geneva (Switzerland). He taught the doctrine of predestination; that is, only those “elected” beforehand by God would achieve salvation. The Calvinists encouraged hard work and a strict moral code. \nCalvinism spread rapidly; and became the Swiss Reformist Church in Switzerland, and the \nDutch Reformed Church in Holland. In England, in 1534, King Henry VIII (r.1509-1547), induced the Parliament to pass the “Act of Supremacy” which instituted an independent Anglican Church of England with the monarch being the head of the church in England. Protestantism showed great advance in the afterwards. Queen Elizabeth I (r. 1558-1603) established a moderate form of Protestantism known as Anglicanism. But the Puritans op -\nposed Anglicanism because it was episcopal (governed by bishops). The puritans were the English people who followed Calvinism. They preferred the Presbyterian type of church government. As a result, Catholicism was officially banned in England. \nIn Scotland, Calvinism was introduced by another religious reformist, John Knox (1505-\n1572, and in 1560 became the official state religion called the Presbyterian Church.

Irish Protestants were sometimes referred to as Ulster. In France Calvinism \nbecame the faith of small influential group called Huguenots. \nThe Catholic Church`s Counter Reformation\nAs Protestantism swept across many parts of Europe, the Catholic Church reacted by mak -\ning limited reforms and reducing its earlier abuses. This movement is known as the Catholic \nCounter Reformation. At the Council of Trent (1545-1563), the Church redefined Catholic beliefs and ended the sale of indulgences so as to stop the spread of Protestantism. The Church also banned Protestant books and established the Inquisition, a court whose pur -\npose was to punish heretics – those who denied Catholic Church teachings. It was used by church officials to end heresy by force. Trials were held to examine, often by torture, those who denied or opposed the teachings of the Catholic Church. Part and parcel of the Counter Reformation was a movement Known as the Society of Jesus, which began in 1534 by a former Spanish knight, Ignatius of Loyola (1 49 1-1556). The Jesuits were dedicated to defend and spread the Catholic faith all over the world. Missionaries brought new peoples to Catholicism. Sisterly Catholic orders such as Dominicans, Franciscans, Jesuits and mem -\nbers of other orders worked among the inhabitants of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. \nThe Historical Significance of the ReformationAs a result of the 16\nth century religious reformation, Europe was divided into the Catholic \nsouth and the Protestant north. France, Italy, Spain and Southern Germany remained Cath -\nolic. Northern Germany, Holland, and Scandinavian countries became Protestant. At first, England remained Catholic. However, when the Pope refused Henry VIII’s demand \nfor a divorce from his Spanish wife, Henry broke with the Catholic Church and turned to Protestantism. Henry closed English monasteries, seized all church lands, and declared him -\nself the head of the English Church in the Act of Supremacy (1534). \nThe Wars between Catholics and Protestants began in the l520s and lasted for more than \na century. Under the leadership of the Pope and with the support of the Holy Roman Em -\nperor, Catholics checked the further spread of Protestantism and even won some areas back to Catholicism. Catholic and Protestant rulers tried to ensure that their subjects were all of one faith through the persecution of religious minorities like the Jews. During the Thirty Years War (1618-1648) of religion and conquest among European nations, one-third of the German population was killed."

In Protestant countries, \npeople no longer had allegiance to the Pope: the secular ruler became the highest authority. In Catholic countries, the Church gave more power to secular rulers to help fight Protestant -\nism. Queen Elizabeth I of England was a good example of a strong secular ruler. She won the loyalty and affection of her subjects, and maintained a moderate form of Protestantism and defended England from attacks by Catholic Spain. \n  \nFigure 4.3 Elizabeth I\nThe Reformation even affected art as different styles of art emerged in Catholic and Prot -\nestant countries. Catholic art glorified Jesus, Mary and the Saints. Many Protestants felt it was wrong to depict God. They specialized in landscapes or “still life” scenes. By creating art about secular subjects, Reformation artists could glorify God by portraying the natural beauty of God`s creation. \nThe weakening of Papal authority may also have stimulated economic growth in Northern \nEurope, where the Church no longer collected taxes. Religious wars resulted in widespread destruction, but also stimulated economies by creating a need for new goods. Some of the protestant attitudes like economical living and wise use of material things may also have contributed to the growth of industry and commerce in Western Europe and elsewhere during the 18\nth and 19th centuries. \n4.8.

Improvements in technology began to undermine many longheld theories. \nAn early challenge to accepted scientific thinking came in the field of astronomy. In 1543, \na Polish cleric and astronomer named Nicholas Copernicus challenged the earlier Ptole -\nmaic (Greek) geocentric theory about the movements of the sun, the moon and planates. After studying planetary movements for more than 25 years, Copernicus formulated a new theory called heliocentric or sun-centered theory. He reasoned that indeed the stars, the earth and other planates revolved around the sun. But his work was banned by the Catholic Church.\n In 1610 an Italian astronomer named Galileo Galilei, using a new, improved tele -\nscope, discovered four moons in orbit around Jupiter, thereby definitively showing that the Earth was not the center of all motion in the universe. But because his findings went against both the Catholic and Protestant church teachings and authority, in 1633, Galileo stood before the court in Rome. At his trial, he was found guilty and was confined to his home.\nLater, the great English scientist Isaac Newton\n formulated a single theory of motion. Newton \nstudied mathematics and physics at Cambridge University. He was 26 years old when he \ndiscovered that the same force ruled motion of the  planets and all matter on earth and in \nspace. This was his law of universal gravitation. According to this law, every object in the universe attracts every other object. The degree of attraction depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them.\nCareful observation and the use of the scientific method eventually became important in \nmany different fields. Scientists developed new tools and instruments to make the precise observations that the scientific method demanded. The first microscope was invented by a Dutch maker of eyeglasses, Zacharias Janssen in 1590. In the 1670s, a Dutch amateur scientist named Anton van Leeuwenhoek used a microscope to examine red blood cells for the first time. In 1643, one of Galileo’s students, Evangelista Torricelli, developed the first mercury barometer, a tool for measuring atmospheric pressure and predicting weather. In 17 1 4, the German physicist Gabriel Fahrenheit made the first thermometer to use mercury in glass. Fahrenheit’s thermometer showed water freezing at 32\n0. A Swedish astronomer, \nAnders Celsius, created another scale for the mercury thermometer in 1742. Celsius’s scale showed freezing at 0\n0.\nGreat advances were also made in the study of medicine, human body and chemistry. A"

In the late 1700s, British physician Edward Jen -\nner introduced a vaccine to prevent smallpox. Jenner used cowpox to produce the world’s first vaccination.\nRobert Boyle pioneered the use of the scientific method in chemistry. He is considered the \nfounder of modern chemistry. Boyle proposed that matter was made up of smaller primary par -\nticles that joined together in different ways. Boyle’s most famous contribution to chemistry is Boyle’s law. This law explains how the volume, temperature, and pressure of gas affect each other.\nThe Enlightenment\nThe breakthroughs in science mentioned above soon moved into other fields of life. Philoso -\nphers and scholars across Europe and colonial North America began to reevaluate long-held beliefs about the human condition, most notably the rights and liberties of ordinary citizens. They sought new insight into the underlying  beliefs regarding government, religion, economics, \nand education. Their efforts spurred a new intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment \nthat stressed reason and thought and the power of individuals to solve problems. It was also \nknown as the Age of Reason. The movement reached its height in the mid-1700s and  brought \ngreat change to many aspects of Western civilization.\nFrance was the center of this 18\nth century intellectual movement because France had become \nthe the intellectual and cultural center of Europe. The social critics of this period in France were \nknown as philosophes , the French word for philosophers. They were journalists and propogan-\ndists as much as true philosophers. The philosophes believed that people could apply reason to all aspects of life, just as Isaac Newton had applied reason to science. Five concepts formed \nthe core of their beliefs:\n1. Reason -- Enlightened thinkers believed truth could be discovered through reason or logical thinking.\n2. Nature -- The philosophes believed that what was natural was good and reasonable.\n3. Happiness -- The philosophes rejected the medieval notion that people should find joy in the hereafter and urged people to seek well-being on earth.\n4. Progress -- The philosophes stressed that society and humankind could improve.\n5. Liberty -- The philosophes called for the liberties that the English people had won in their Glorious Revolution (1688) and Bill of Rights (1689)."

The Byzantine Empire reached its greatest size and power under Justinian I (527-565 A.D). The Byzantines were adherents of Greek Orthodox Christianity. They preserved ancient Greek literature and philosophy as well as Roman gov-ernmental and legal traditions. The invasion of Byzantine territory including the Holy Land by Seljuk Turks during the 1 1\nth century eventually led to the long series of wars known as \ncrusades. After a long period of decline, the Byzantine Empire collapsed in 1 454 when its capital, Constantinople, was controlled by the ever-expanding Ottoman Turks. \nThough politically divided and feudal in its economy, in Western Europe eventually, Gre -\nco-Roman, Germanic and Christian traditions slowly blended creating a new civilization \nknown as medieval civilization. Much of Europe was covered by the manorial system. Kings and great lords gave land called manor (fief) to vassals in return for military service. Peasants, most of whom were tenants, cultivated and lived on the manorial lands (fiefs or estates of lords). The manorial system began to decline when trade and towns revived beginning from the 1 1\nth century. In towns and cities merchant and craft guilds emerged. Town life en -\ncouraged a greater interest in art and learning. This was important for the development of capitalist relations during the late medieval period.\nThe 7\nth century was also marked by the rise and expansion of Muslim Arabs and Islamic \nreligion. Within a period of one hundred years Muslim Arabs established a huge empire \nlinking Asia, Africa and Europe. Damascus in Syria and Baghdad in Iraq were successive capitals of the Umayyad (661-750) and Abbasid (750-1270) caliphates. Islamic civilization had its own typical characteristics. But Muslim Arabs also borrowed freely from the cultures of earlier civilizations and the peoples with whom they came into contacts. \nDuring the late medieval period, the Ottomans from central Asia expanded westwards and \nestablished their own empire centered in Istanbul following the collapse of the Byzantine Empire. The Ottomans became powerful and founded their own version of Islamic civiliza -\ntion. They became powerful, closed the routes leading to the Far East and, as a result, forced West Europeans to find new sea routes in order to reach there. \nIn the Far East, several dynasties ruled imperial China. Chinese dynasties rose to power, and \nachieved economic and cultural prosperity under the Mandate of Heaven. The loss of the Mandate of Heaven led to the downfall of several Chinese dynasties. The Tang and Song Dynasties were particularly strong periods during which China was in its golden age."

The linguistic diversity of Africa is striking. The number of languages spoken as a first language ranges from between 1,000 and 2,000.  This means that perhaps about one-third of the world’s languages can be found in Africa alone. At least 75 of these languages are spoken by a million people or more. Nigeria itself has around 500 languages, making it one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world.\nThere might be a few thousand languages spoken natively in Africa, but most of them fall \nneatly into just a few categories. Language scholars classify the languages of Africa into four different families, or phyla: the Niger-Congo languages, the Afro-Asiatic languages, the Nilo-Saharan languages, and the Khoisan languages. \nThe Niger-Congo Languages of Africa : -The Niger-Congo languages make up the \nlargest language family in Africa. They are found across a wide area of the continent, most-ly in the western, central, and southeastern regions. They are further sub-divided into the Bantu and the non-Bantu languages depending mostly on their geography, with the Bantu tongues found more toward the southern part of the Niger-Congo linguistic territory.\nOne of the Niger-Congo languages of Africa you might recognize most is Swahili, whose \ndifferent dialects are spoken by about 16 million people natively and 82 million as a sec -\nond language. It was influenced heavily by Arabic due in no small part to the history of trade between Africa and people from Arab lands. It is sometimes considered the lingua franca of the African Great Lakes region because it is so widely used and taught, among others, in schools in places like Tanzania, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kenya.\nOther Niger-Congo languages with populations of speakers in the millions include Yoruba \n(mostly in Nigeria), Kirundi (in Burundi), Lingala (in the Congo), Sesotho (in Lesotho and parts of southern Africa) and Shona (in Zimbabwe). South Africa recognizes 9 Bantu lan -\nguages - Xhosa, Ndebele, Zulu, Tswana, Swati, Sotho, Southern Sotho, Venda and Tsonga."

They were originally Turkish slaves first brought to Egypt in the late 12\nth century. Mamluke is an Arabic \nword meaning “owned” or “slave”. The Mamluks were trained as soldiers and rose to high army and government posts before they revolted and seized control of Egypt. Before the Mamluk’s rise to power in 1250, Egypt was under the Ayyaubid Sultanate from 1 170 until its collapse in 1250. The major cause for the rise of the Mamluks was power struggle within the Ayyubid family. Several provinces of Egypt were ruled by princes of the Ayyubid family. These princes always fought against each other to take the position of Sultan in Egypt. Thus, as a means to avoid such political rivalry the Ayyubid sultans began to depend on mercenary soldiers, who were loyal to them. The Mamluks were such mercenaries who suc -\nceeded in establishing their rule over Egypt. The Ayyubid Sultan who organized a mercenary Mamluk regiment was al-Malik al-Salih.\nThe historical development that enabled the Mamluks to seize power in Egypt was the \nMongol invasion of the Middle East. Powerful armed bands moved to Syria and Palestine where they pillaged the provinces and massacred the Christians of Jerusalem in 1244. This incident led to a strong reaction among the Western Christian states. As a result, the army of the sixth Crusade led by King Louis IX of France, invaded Egypt.At the time of the inva -\nsion, sultan al- Malik al-Salih was killed. But, the Mamluks fought against the crusaders. In the ensuing war, the Mamluks defeated the crusaders and captured Louis IX. In 1250, the Sultan was assassinated that led to Mamluk control of power in Egypt. In the 1250s, the Mongols attempted a second conquest of Egypt, but they were defeated by the Mamluks again, as they had been the prior time. This repeated victory against foreign invaders, though they themselves were outsiders, gave them prestige and acceptance as champions of Islam, which significantly helped them to control power. \nThe Mamluk rule in Egypt witnessed economic prosperity and greatness. Under their rule \narchitecture, craftsmanship, and scholarship flourished. They published artfully decorated military strategy manuals, and were passionate about polo (horseback ball game), due to its similarity to military battle. The economic prosperity of Mamluk Egypt was a function"

Muslims in West Africa carrying huge \namount of gold had to pass through Cairo on their pilgrimage to Mecca, and the revenue that Egypt gained from the Spice Trade that linked the Far East with the Mediterranean world along the Red Sea. This economic growth in Egypt strengthened the military power of the Mamluks to launch military expeditions towards the south. One of such expeditions was the one that they made to Nubia in the Sudan. In 1275, they controlled Nubia and converted the people to Islam. \nBy the dawn of the 15\nth century, the Mongols sought to attack Egypt. However, they had to \nfight with the Ottoman Turks whom they defeated. The latter, the major threats to the Mam -\nluks, also sought to attack Egypt, but their power was heavily weakened at the hands of the \nMongols. However, this temporary ease had to be challenged at the beginning of the 16th \ncentury. In 15 16, the Ottoman Turks controlled Egypt. This marked the end of about 260 years of actual Mamluk rule in Egypt. The rivalry between the Portuguese and the Ottoman Turks over the control of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean was the main reason that mo -\ntivated the Ottoman Turks to control Egypt.

The Almoravid movement began in the 1 1th century. They were nomads of the Maghreb region. The Lamtuna (nomadic Muslim and Berber tribe) began the Almoravid movement. Ibin Yasin and later Emir Yahiya of Morocco were the most popular leaders. The movement called for a return to the primitive purity of Islam. In 1053 A.D, Ibin Yasin abdicated his power in favor of Yahiya to lead the Almoravid movement. In 1056 A.D, he died and was succeeded by his brother Abu Bakar. During its formative period (1042-1053 A.D), they sought to establish a political community in which the ethical and judicial principles of Islam were strictly applied. In 1062, Marrakesh was made the capital of the Almoravids located in southern Morocco from where they had captured the entire territory of Mo -\nrocco and western Algeria in the 1080s. By1 106, the only Muslim state that had survived Almoravid conquest was Saragossa. In 1 1 10 A.D, Saragossa succumbed to the Almorvids. Politically, the state was tribal where the Lamtuna exercised much power. In the middle of the 12th century, the Almohads replaced the power of the Almoravids for the following reasons; strict observance of Islam, Lamtuna lust for power, and internal rivalries. In addition to the role that they played in spreading Islam, the Almoravids developed the culture of the Maghreb region.\nAnother movement that played significant role in the spread of Islam into the Maghreb was \nthe Almohad. Unlike the Almoravids, the Almohads were settled by Masmuda Berbers of the Atlas Mountains. Ibn Tumart was the founder of the Almohad religious reform movement. He was fundamentalist who opposed the custom of aristocratic unveiled Lamuta women and the use of musical instruments. For him, the Quran is the sole source of Islamic life who strived to live like the prophet Mohammed.  Initially a religious reformer, in 1 124/’25 Tumart became a religious and political leader. In 1 130, he died and was succeeded by Ab -\ndul Mumin, who led the Almohads to victory over the Almoravids. He was the real founder of the Almohad Empire. In 1 1 17 , he invaded Morocco, deposed and then executed the last Almoravid king and controlled power. In 1050 they invaded Spain and in 1 160, the whole of the Maghreb region.By the early 13th century, the power of the Almohads in Spain faded away owing to division among the Muslims and attack from Christian Europe. In 1269 A.D, Almohad rule in North Africa came to an end due to internal division and civil war."

In the immedi -\nate aftermath of Ghana’s collapse, the Mandinka people of the upper Niger suffered a bitter \ndefeat by a rival leader. Except Sundiata, all of his sons were killed. By 1235, Sundiata had crushed his enemies, won control of the gold trade routes, and founded the empire of Mali. Sundiata ruled Mali from 1230 to 1255. He and his successor controlled such important gold fields as Wangara and Bambak.\nYet, the power of Mali reached its height during the reign of Mansa (King) Musa (r.13 12-\n1337). He was the first to embrace Islam, which gained much progress afterwards.

What was the largest of West African empires?\nAs we noted above, in the 1 400s, disputes over succession among weak rulers weakened Mali. Subject people broke away and the empire contracted. By the 1 460s, the wealthy trad -\ning city of Gao had become the capital of the emerging West African kingdom of Songhai.  \nSonghai developed in the fertile region at the bend of the Niger River in the present-day \nstates of Mali and Niger. Between 1 464 and 1 492, Sunni Ali built the largest state that had ever existed in West Africa. He brought trade routes and wealthy states like Timbuktu under his control. Unlike the rulers of Mali, he did not adopt Islam, but he followed an indige -\nnous religion. Soon after Sunni Ali’s death in 1 492, however, the emperor Askia Muham -\nmad set up a Muslim dynasty. He further expanded the territory of Songhai and improved the government. To run the empire more efficiently, he set up a bureaucracy with separate departments for farming, the military and the treasury. Each was supervised by officials ap -\npointed by the emperor. Like Mansa Musa, Askia Muhammad made a pilgrimage to Mecca that led to stronger ties with the wider Muslim world. Scholars from Muslim lands flocked to Askia Muhammad’s court at Gao. In towns and cities across Songhai, he built Mosques and opened schools for the study of the Quran. \nThough Songhai continued to prosper after the death of Askia Muhammad in 1528, dis -\nputes over succession led to frequent changes in leadership. In 1549, Askia Daud became \nemperor, and the empire experienced relative peace. After his death in 1582, succession"

At this time of unrest, the Sultan of \nMorocco, Ahmed al-Mansur, sent his army south to control the gold and salt mines of Songhai. By 159 1, these invaders, using gunpowder weapons, had conquered the empire. Like the Almoravids who conquered Ghana, the Moroccans were unable to rule an empire that stretched across the Sahara. Their control over the region was weakened, but the glory of Songhai could not be restored.\nEmpire of Kanem-Bornu: \n-It was an African trading empire ruled by the Saifuwa dynasty \nthat controlled the area around Lake Chad from the 9th to the 19th century. Its territory \nat various times included what is now southern Chad, northern Cameroon, northeastern \nNigeria, eastern Niger, and southern Libya. The Kanem- Bornu state was founded by the Kanuri, a mixed Negroid and Berber people living east of Lake Chad. It was ruled by the Mais sultans of the Saifuwa dynasty who came to power in about 850 AD. The capital city was called Njimi. The economy of the state was based on the Trans-Saharan-Trade. Since the empire was conveniently located in the center of the Sudan, it was in contact with Nubia in the east, Egypt and other North African states in the north, and also with its western and southern neighbors. As a result, Kanen-Bornu exploited the trade of half of the continent north of the equator. The state was subject to the influence of Islam, which in the 1 1\nth \ncentury became the accepted religion. Conquests during the next 200 years expanded the empire as far west as the Niger River and east to Wadai, and to the north, its power into the Fezzan. In the 1 4\nth century, wars with the Bulala people to the South forced the Mias \nto move West to Bornou, where succeeding Mais reestablished the empire, and under Ali \nGhaji, founded a new capital at Ngazargamu. The 16th century was one of renewed expan -\nsion and power for the state under Mai Idris Alooma who had acquired firearms from the Turks in North Africa.\nMap 5.1 Empires of the Western Sudan"

Historically, the first city-states evolved in the classical period of Greek civilization during the 4\nth and 5th centuries B.C. The unique characteristic of a city-state that \nsets it aside from other types of government is its sovereignty or independence. This means that a city-state has the full right and power to govern itself and its citizens, without any interference from outside governments. \nIn Africa, the Hausa people established several city-states in what is now Northern Nigeria.  \nThe first of the states, Daura (probably the oldest of all), Gobir, and Rano, emerged around 1000 A.D.  Other major Hausa city-states include Katsina, Zazzau, Gobir, Kano, Rano, and Biram. The Hausa city states emerged as the southern terminals of the Trans-Saharan cara -\nvan trade.  Like many larger cities, such as Gao and Timbuktu in the Mali Empire, these city states began as centers of a long distance trade that included leather, gold, cloth, salt, kola nuts, and animal hides.  Hausa merchants in each of these cities collected trade items from the rainforest region to the south, processed, and taxed them, and then sent them north to cities along the Mediterranean. Therefore, trade and agriculture formed the economic basis of the Hausa city states. The trade probably influenced political development as ideas (and people) from the Middle East and North Africa made their way south to the cities.  Certain -"

Kano and Katsina in the \nnorth were specialized in trade and craft technology. Daura on the other hand was special -\nized in iron working. Zaria located in the southernmost was the principal provider of slaves.\nAlthough each Hausa city state began as small walled village of Hausa speakers, trade \nbrought immigrants from the north, west, and east, all of whom were incorporated into these growing urban societies.  Both indigenous people and immigrants farmed the areas around the cities, providing food for the urban population in exchange for military pro -\ntection from nomads and rival political states. By the 1500s Kano had become the largest and most prosperous of the city states. It was a major trading center for ivory, gold, leather, and slaves.  Arab and Berber traders resided in the city along with local merchants.  It also became the leading center for Islamic culture in the region although it was challenged on occasion by Katsina.  At times Kano and other city states attempted to conquer their rivals but none of them had the military or economic capacity to dominate the region.  Conse -\nquently, the city states remained a loose confederation sometimes working jointly but more often as economic and political rivals.\nThat rivalry, however, came to an end in 1804 when Uthman Dan Fodio, a Fulani religious \nleader from Gobir, began a jihad that in 1815 swallowed all of the city states into the Soko -\nto Caliphate.

Trade between West Africa and the Mediterranean predated Islam. However, North African Muslims intensified the Trans-Saharan trade. North African traders were major actors in introducing Islam into West Africa. Several major trade routes connected Africa below the Sahara with the Mediterranean Middle East, such as Sijilmasa to Awdaghust and Ghadames to Gao. These centers of trade invariably became centers of Islamic learning and civilization.  \nIn the Kingdom of Tekrur, situated on both banks of the Senegal, Islam was accepted as \nearly as 850 A.D., by the Dya’ogo dynasty.  This dynasty was the first Negro people who ac -\ncepted Islam. This gave a uniform Muslim law to the people.  By the time the Al- Murabitun of Almoravids began their attack on Tekrur in 1042 A.D., Islam had made a deep impact on the people of that area.  In the 1 1\nth century A.D., Islam was introduced into the empire \nof Ghana. Sources also indicate that the rulers of Mali accepted Islam as early as the 1 4th \ncentury.

Who produced it? What important information do we get from it about the history of the East African coast? \nOn the east coast of Africa lies a narrow strip of land that has hosted travelers for thou -\nsands of years. When ships were powered by sails, the seasonally alternating Indian Ocean monsoon winds allowed for efficient sea voyages up and down the coast. One of the first written records of the area’s significance, a Greek merchant’s guide from the first century A.D, describes sailing voyages on the Red Sea and the coast of East Africa. This work, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, describes the wealth of ivory, rhino horn, tortoise shell, and palm oil available for trade in each of these east African city-states.\n \nThis coastal region, which today stretches along the eastern edge of Africa from Somalia in the north to Mozambique in the south, is known as the Zanj also known as the Swahili Coast.It is home to a unique culture and language-a mixture of African, Arab, and Indian Ocean peoples. The original inhabitants of the Swahili Coast were Bantu-speaking Africans, who had migrated east from the continent’s interior. They eventually spread up and down the coast, trading with each other, with the people of the interior, and eventually with peo -\nple from other continents.\nThe prominent settlements on the Zanj coast included Shungwaya (Bur Gao), as well as \nMalindi, Gedi, and Mombasa. By the late medieval period, the area included at least 37 substantial Swahili trading towns, many of them quite wealthy. However, these communities never consolidated into a single political entity.The urban ruling and commercial classes of these Swahili settlements were occupied by Arab and Persian immigrants. The Bantu people inhabited the coastal regions, and were organized only as family groups. The inhabitants in Zanj were for centuries shipped as slaves by Arab traders to all the countries bordering"

The Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs recruited many slaves from Zanj as \nsoldiers and, as early as 696 AD, we learn of slave revolts of Zanj origin against their Arab masters in Iraq. Ancient Chinese texts also mention ambassadors from Java presenting the Chinese emperor with two Seng Chi (Zanji) slaves as gifts, and Seng Chi slaves reaching China from the Hindu kingdom of Sri Vijaya in Java.\nThe term Zanj apparently fell out of use in the tenth century. However, after 1861, when the \narea controlled by the Arab Sultan of Zanzibar was forced by the British to split with the parent country of Oman, it was often referred to as Zanj. The south-eastern coast of Africa was known as the Sea of Zanj and included the Mascarene Islands and Madagascar. \nNot much is known about the history of the Swahili Coast in the immediate centuries after \nthe Periplus, although archaeologists have found hints of connections between this region and the Roman and Byzantine empires. Starting with the eighth century A.D, when Muslim traders, mostly Arabs, came to settle permanently in the region-historical records became more detailed. In the 12th century, Persian settlers known as Shirazi-arrived. Today, the vast majority of Swahili people are Sunni Muslims.\nThe Swahili Coast appears to have reached its zenith during the Medieval Period, from \naround the 1 1\nth to 15th centuries. During that time, the Swahili Coast comprised numerous \ncity-states that traded across the Indian Ocean. The city-states were independent sultanates, although they shared a common language (Swahili) and religion (Islam). They traded across the Indian Ocean for items, such as pottery, silks, and glassware.\nAmong the southern-most of the major city-states-and a major archaeological site today-is \nKilwa, located on an island off the southern coast of Tanzania. During the medieval pe -\nriod, it maintained an outpost at Sofala for trading with the gold-rich Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe, which was located to the south. In medieval times, Kilwa was one of the most important trading centers on the east African coast. \nPerhaps one of the most spectacular sights along the Swahili Coast during the Medieval Pe -\nriod would have been the arrival of the ships of the Chinese admiral Zheng He. The Chinese made some diplomatic expeditions to the Swahili coast. The expeditions included great fleets of hundreds of warships and cargo ships for carrying trade and tribute. On his later voyages, Zheng He visited Mombasa and Malindi (both in modern-day Kenya), and Moga -\ndishu (in modern-day Somalia).

There, the Portuguese attempted to control all trade and commerce in the Indian Ocean. They established bases at several sites along the Swahili Coast. Interactions with the Portuguese and a consequent decrease in trade led to the decline of the Swahili Coast city-states, although some did carry on for another few centuries, some under the rule of the Omani Empire.\nToday, Swahili is the lingua franca of East Africa.

This is the site where the civilization of Great Zimbabwe once thrived. The word Zimbabwe comes from a Bantu-based word that means “stone house.” In fact, Great Zimbabwe was built by a succession of Bantu-speaking peoples, apparently by the Shona, who settled in the region between 900-1500 A.D. These new comers brought iron, mining methods, and improved farming skills. Early settlers raised cattle and built stone enclosures to protect their livestock. With the passage of time, these settlers improved their building methods and erected impressive large walls and palaces. \nThe capital reached its height by the dawn of the 1 4\nth century, probably about 1300 A.D. \nBy then, it had tapped nearby gold resources and cultivated profitable commercial links \nwith coastal cities such as Sofala and Kilwa.

What pejorative terms do you know that are attached to the San and Khoi Khoi people?\nThe southern part of Africa was occupied by three major ethnic and linguistic groups. The dominant people of the region were the Bantu. The other two groups were the Khoi-Khoi and San peoples. The languages of the two peoples are grouped under the Khoisan lan -\nguage super family. In this sub-section, we will focus on the Khoi Khoi and the San.\nBy the time Southern and Western South Africa was colonized by European settlers in the \n17\nth century, the Khoi Khoi were economically pastoral. The white settlers called them \n“Hottentos,” which is now derogatory (offensive). The majority of the remaining Khoi Khoi people live in the southern part of Namibia, and the term has been extended to include the culturally mixed descendants of the original Khoi Khoi, who are now scattered throughout the south-western part of South Africa.\nThe Khoi Khoi were related to two neighboring peoples, the San (Bushmen, European ver -\nsion of the San, which is now a pejorative of insult) and the Bantu.

Consequently, they became a minority group in the most inhospitable part of the Kalahari Desert.\n•\tWhat physical features distinguish the San from the Khoi Khoi?\nThe San have lived in Southern Africa for thousands of years. Their territory, once extensive, was restricted by white settlers after the early 1700s. By the time the San lived as hunter- gatherers, they were organized into small groups, or bands, of about ten families. At this stage, women gathered wild plants and fruits while men killed animals with light bows and poison-tipped arrows. The San sometimes lived in caves or thatched shelters and wore short aprons and sandals made of skin. The San are distinguished by their short height, yellow and copper skin colour and kinky hair.\n5.7 .

Let alone the Europeans, the kind of relationship that existed between the different regions of Africa was very limited. In connecting the dif -\nferent regions of the continent of Africa, the contribution of trade figures prominently. As we have noted in the preceding pages, trade connected north-east and south-east Africa with the Swahili coast. Besides, Egyptian pharaohs used to send commercial expeditions to the land of Punt.

While Ghana was an inte -\ngral part of the early trans-Saharan trade, neither it nor any other Western Sudan state was built by the trans-Saharan trade. Fundamentally, important to the success of the Empire of Ghana between the eighth and twelfth centuries, this trading system reached its peak during the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries, during the heydays of the Mali and Songhai Empires. In the period from 500 A.D to1590 A.D, routes rose and declined in importance depending on the empire in power and the amount of security it could maintain for traders and trade routes.\nThe major trade routes can be divided in to three. These were the North-South, West-East, \nand Southern routes. In the North-South and West-East routes, camel formed the major pack animal that made transportation of goods and merchants possible. Egypt in Africa and Mecca in the Near East were the last destinations of merchants in the east. In the Southern route that stretched upto the Hausa city-states, donkeys, human porters or canoes were used. Some of the major market centers include Fez, and Marrakesh in Morocco, Sijilma -\nsa, Wadan, Audaghost, Takrur, Taghaza, Tichitt-Walata, Djenné, Wargla, Timbuktu, Tripoli, Ghadames, Ghat, Takedda, Katsina, Kano, Fezzan, Bilma, Bauchi, Cyrenaicain, and Wadai.Wangara, Bambuk, Bure, and Lobi-pourra were the major gold fields of the Western Sudan.\nTrade Commodities and Pattern: -Salt, which was plenty in North Africa, gold, which was \nplenty in West Africa, and slaves were the essential commodities throughout the 500-1590 period. Cloth had also become an important trade good. A viable cloth-production industry began around the eleventh century in Djenné, Takrur, Timbuktu, and Gao and lasted well into the eighteenth century. By the eleventh century a typical caravan included one thousand camels. It might, for example, set out from Sijilmasa in North Africa loaded with salt from Taghaza, foodstuffs, cloth, perfumes, and other goods from the Maghrib. Its next stop was Wadan, an oasis in the present-day nation of Mauritania, where some of the goods were sold and new items purchased; then the caravan went to Walata or Tichitt on the southern edge of the Sahara, and finally it went on to Timbuktu.

North East and Northern Africa    \n       The Funj Sultanate\nThe 16th-19th centuries` history of Africa was marked by state formation and the expansion \nof trade and Islamic religion in the continent.  In northeast Africa, in 1275, the Nubian \n(now Sudan) Christian kingdoms of Alwa and Makuria were annexed by the Egyptian Mam -\nluks. The expansion of various Arab clans and Islam into Nubia since the beginning of the 14\nth century resulted in the supremacy of Arabs in Nubia.  \nHowever, by the beginning of the 16th century, Arab supremacy in Nubia was challenged \nby cattle keeping pastoral people called Funj. The Funj practiced indigenous religion. Their origin is still controversial. Some historians say that the Funj belong to the Shilluk people, while others associate them with the state of Bornu around Lake Chad. Still, others locate their origins in the northern Ethiopian region.  \nIn Nubia, the Funj quickly converted to Islam. In 1504, they established the Funj Sultanate \nwith its center at Sennar.  A competing Arab state called Abdallabi arose in Nubia alongside the Funj. Abdallabi fought for grazing rights in southern Gezira as well as Nubia’s political supremacy. Amara Dunqas was one of the renowned chiefs of Funj who fought many battles against the Abdallabi state for supremacy in Nubia. In the end, the Funj emerged victorious and ruled Nubia with the help of Abdallabi Arabs. Territorial expansion into Nilotic Sudan"

The Arab clans intermarried with local Nu-\nbians and became Africanized culturally. \nThe Funj faced three rounds of major attacks from the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia. \nAround 1620, King Susenyos (r. 1607-32) launched an expedition and destroyed and looted several villages of the Funj Sultanate. In 1742 and 1744, King Iyasu II (r. 1730-55) launched two other expeditions against the Funj, in the second of which the Christian army faced a humiliating defeat by a coalition of Funj and Arab troops. In the years that followed, the Funj Sultanate extended its hegemony over Kordofan and Darfur to the west and remained the most important state in the region until it was conquered by Mohammed Ali`s Egypt in 1821. \nThe Rise of the Moroccan Sultanate  \nIn North Africa, the 16th century saw the rise of Morocco as an independent state. The Sa` -\ndids Arab clans united the whole of Morocco by then. Under its Sultan, Ahmad al-Mansur (r. 1578-1603), Morocco was at the height of its power in the late 16\nth century. It was the \nonly state in North Africa that was not ruled by the Ottoman Turks. Morocco also drove out the Portuguese from the North African coast in 1578. Further, it came into conflict with the Songhay Empire in West Africa. In 159 1, the Sultan sent an army armed with fire arms across the Sahara to seize control of the gold mines of Songhay. The Moroccan army captured and looted Gao and Timbuktu. Then, the army captured much gold and slaves and sent them to Morocco. As a result, the Songhay Empire disintegrated and the culture of Timbuktu was destroyed. However, this had a negative consequence on Morocco itself. The regular trade in gold with North Africa was disrupted and much of it was diverted eastwards to Tunis, Tripoli and Cairo and southwards to European traders on the Atlantic coast of West Africa. \nFollowing Ahmad al-Mansur`s death in 1603, the Moroccan state was weakened by an \ninternal dynastic struggle, and, as a result, it was divided into the two rival sultanates of Fez and Marrakesh. It was the sultans of the Alawid Dynasty (established in 1669) who restored the unity of Morocco in the second half of the 17\nth century. The new dynasty strengthened \nthe power of Morocco by conscripting more West African captives into the Moroccan army. \nOn the other hand, the military presence of Morocco on the Niger bend across the Sahara \ncontinued in the 17th century. But most parts of the former Songhay Empire were outside \nof Moroccan control. Besides, the Moroccan army on the Niger bend, known as Arma, intermarried into the local population and settled as military governors of a number of"

The Arma rule finally collapsed in 1737 \nwhen the Tuareg Berber nomads established control over Timbuktu and the entire Niger bend grass land.\n6.1.2. Benin, Oyo, Dahomey and Ashante \nSizable states developed in the forest region of West Africa. They owed their growth and prosperity to long- distance trade organized by Muslim traders from West Africa. In the 1 4\nth \nand 15th centuries, the Edo people of what is now southern Nigeria rose to prominence and \nestablished the Empire of Benin. By the end of the 15th century, the Empire of Benin reached \nits peak. Its capital, Benin City, was a walled city with spacious streets and wooden houses. Ocean trade, mainly with the Portuguese and the Dutch, was the main factor for the growth of its power. Merchants of Benin exchanged pepper and dyed cotton goods for European manufactured products. Benin was also famous for its bronze sculptures. The empire of Benin began to decline in the 17\nth century.\nLikewise, in the 17th century, many of the Yoruba chieftaincies united to form the Empire \nof Oyo. The empire flourished over much of present-day Nigeria for over a hundred years. \nYoruba`s economy was basically agriculture, but they were also proficient in craft technolo -\ngy, including spinning, dyeing and metal work. The Empire of Oyo disintegrated in the 19th \ncentury as a result of invasions by its neighbours, mainly the fanatical Muslim Fulani and rebellions by some of its subjected kingdoms. Subsequently, the Fulani (Fulbe) occupied the entire Housa land and established the Sokoto caliphate in what is now northern Nigeria. This African caliphate became popular with the Jihads of the Fulani cleric named Usman dan Fodio during the first half of the 19\nth century. \n                                             Map 6.2 The Sokoto Caliphate in West Africa, c.1820"

The training of women in military arts was probably peculiar to Dahomey in Africa. The women`s regiments, known as the Abomey Amazons, were elite forces in the Dahomeyan army.  In the 19\nth century, they were commanded by the fiercest \nof them all, Seh-Dong-Hong-Beh, a gallant warrior and a leader.

At the end of the 17\nth century, \nthe Ashantehene (king of Ashante) united most of what is now Ghana and the power and prosperity of the kingdom grew. Tribute from subjected people and the trans-Saharan gold trade were the main sources of revenue. When gold trade declined, the Ashante traded with the Portuguese at Gold Coast for slaves and imported guns, clothes and manufactured goods. They also exported kola nuts to the Savanna lands to the north. The capital, Kumasi, was a fine city. In the 18\nth century, to protect their gold trade, the Ashanti expanded into the \ngrasslands to the north. In the early 19th century, they also extended their rule over the coast -\nal areas to the south. The Ashanti kings modernized the system of government by appointing officials based on ability.

The most well-known and powerful of them was Buganda, which flourished on the fertile plain northwest of Lake Victoria. The kabaka, king of Buganda, expanded his authority over a vast region in what is now Uganda in the 18\nth century.

The Manikongo (king of Kongo) ruled a highly centralized government. Mbanza Kongo (now San Salvador) was the capital of the kingdom. It was divided into six provinces and had a strong administrative structure. The king appointed regional governors who were responsible for the collection of tribute from local chiefs in the form of ivory, millet, palm wine, and leopard and lion skins. Agriculture and trade (regional and coastal trade) were the basis of the economy in the kingdom. The major trade items were iron tools, pottery, sea salt, mats, fine clothes, basket -\nwork, ivory, slaves, copper and iron trinkets. Weaving and iron smelting were respected jobs only practiced by the nobilities of the kingdom."

Its capital was Khami, where the stonewalling (stone enclosure) traditions of Great Zimbabwe were further developed and refined.

Using a small but powerful army, Mutota controlled \nthe region and long-distance trade between the plateau and the Swahili coast of East Africa. He and his son and successor, Matope, conquered all the lands between the Kalahari Desert in the west and Mozambique in the east. Mutota and Matope acquired the royal title of Mwene Mutapa (master conqueror or pillager). From the royal title, the Mutapa state was also called the Mwene Mutapa Empire. Later, the Portuguese on the Indian Ocean coast named it the Kingdom of Monomotapa. In the 16\nth century, Mwene Mutapa dominated the \ntrade in gold and ivory along the Zambezi Valley, notably with the Swahili coastal trading posts at Sena and Tete.

Subsequently, a century long war was fought between the southern Bantu and the Boers. In response to this struggle, several Bantu states emerged in southern Africa. One of them was the Zulu Kingdom, which attained dominance in the region, particularly during the reign of Shaka Zulu (r. 1818-1828). Shaka successfully de -\nfended his kingdom from neighbouring Bantu clans and Boers, largely with the support of his mother, Queen Nandi. However, after the death of Shaka, the Zulu kingdom was weak -\nened by wars with the neighbouring rival Bantu clans and British colonizers. In the middle of the 19\nth century, the British took over the Cape Colony from the Dutch farmers. The British \nfurther expanded northwards. In the 1860s, the Zulu kingdom and many Bantu clans were conquered by the British. \n6.1.6. The Ottoman Conquest of North Africa        \nThough it was nominal, until the early 19th century North Africa, except Morocco, remained \nunder Ottoman Turkish rule. Throughout the 16th century, the two world powers, the Otto -\nmans and Spaniards, fought over control of North Africa. Military supremacy of Ottoman navy and Janissaries, and the religious affinity or cooperation of North African Arab and Berber Muslims helped the Ottomans to eventually defeat the Spaniards chasing them out of their Maghrebi coastal posts of Ifriqiya (Tunisia), Algieris and Tripolitania. \nThe Ottomans conquered Egypt in 15 17 by utterly defeating its Mamluk rulers. The Otto -\nmans extended their conquest of North Africa by controlling what are today Libya, Algeria \nand Tunisia, and threatened Morocco. Ottomans also pacified Arab and Berber nomads."

Turkish was the official language, and Arabs and Berbers were excluded from top government posts. The pashas of these provinces were reinforced by corps of well-armed Turkish Janissaries whose total number dwindled from about 15,000 in the 17\nth century to nearly 4,000 by 1830. \nProvincial Janissary corpses were reinforced by Ottoman provincial cavalry forces known as spahis. The spahis were more respected by local populations because their officers were offspring of Turkish soldiers and local Arab women. Each province was divided into Sanjaks (sub provinces), each administered by a Mutasarrif (deputy governor) who were account -\nable to the provincial Wali (governor general). The sub provinces were further divided into districts whose local administration was left for local Arab chiefs. \nThe Ottomans introduced the millet system of local administration to North Africa. They \nalso tried to reform land holding, taxation and military services and develop trade and com -\nmerce. Fire arms exported by the Ottoman traders across the Sahara were very important for the consolidation of West African states. For instance, in the 16\nth century, Mai Idris Alooma \n(r.157 1-1603) of Kanem Bornu, who had acquired fire arms from North African Turks, was able to expand his empire once again. \nHowever, the empire was overstretched, and the Ottoman Sultan did not take much inter -\nest to directly rule North African states from Istanbul provided that they paid their taxes. \nFrom 1700 the local military rulers in Algeria, Tunisia, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, though nominally gave allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and sent tribute to him, were practically independent.

In 1805, Mohammed Ali established a new dynasty that ruled Egypt for over 150 years. In the 1840s, Cyrenaica and Tripolitania became the main base of a Muslim religious reform group called the Senussi. Their leader, Mohammed Ben Ali as-Senusi, preached a return to the simplicity of early Islam. Algeria was occupied by the French in the 1830s and 1840s. The territory was extended into the Sahara Desert, and some 40,000 French colonists were settled there; a figure that reached 400,000 by the early 1880s."

Early Contacts Along the Western and Central African Coasts\nThe Northern coastline of Africa was always in contact with Europe across the Mediter -\nranean Sea. European contact with the other parts of Africa was begun by the Portuguese in the 15\nth century. The exploration was facilitated and sponsored by an organization set \nup by the 15th century Portuguese prince, Henry (the Navigator). The main motive of the \nPortuguese for this was the need to gain direct access to the gold producing areas of West Africa. Besides, the Portuguese wanted to bypass Arab middlemen and Turkish blockade of the land and sea routes leading to the rich sources of trade items in the Far East. \nIn the 15\nth and 16th centuries the Spaniards and Portuguese obtained a foothold on the \nports of the Mediterranean coast of North Africa. In 1 415, with the aim of navigating the \nAfrican coast, the Portuguese occupied the coastal town of Ceuta in what is now Moroc -\nco. In the same year, they reached the Canary Islands, which had already been claimed by \nSpain.  In 1 418, the Portuguese reached the  Madeira Islands and established a colony at Por -\nto Santo. The Spaniards also occupied Oran in Algeria in 1 409 and Melilla in Morocco in 1 496. In 1578, however, Portugal`s attempt to control Morocco ended in disaster in which both the king of Portugal, Sebastian I (r. 1557-78), and many Portuguese nobility were killed at the \nBattle of Alcácer Quibir  (4 August 1578) in Northern Morocco."

After a decade, rounding the Cape, they got access to the Swahili trading states on the east -\nern coast of Africa.  This was a remarkable success because Europeans could now reach all coasts of Africa. Besides, they could now bypass Turkish blockade and Arab intermediaries to have direct access to the trade of the Far East. These early contacts made by the Portu -\nguese led to the establishment of the first of a series of European footholds on the coasts of Africa.  Portuguese explorations of the West African coasts also served as a basis for the later outstanding explorations of Christopher Columbus and Vasco Da Gama.\nTherefore, the Portuguese explored and monopolized Northwest African islands like Madei -\nra (c.1 418), Azores (1 439) and Cape Verde (1 460).  In 1 446, they landed and established \ntrading posts on the Senegal coast of West Africa. The Portuguese established sugar plan-tations on these islands. These plantations were worked by slave labour from West African coast.  Merchants also used these Atlantic outposts as debarkation points for subsequent journeys. \nIn the central west, the Portuguese navigator Diogo Cao arrived at the mouth of Congo \nRiver in 1 482, and claimed the territory around it for Portugal. At first, the Portuguese made an alliance with the Ngola (king) of the small kingdom of Ndongo in what is now northern Angola. The dominant people of this kingdom were the Bantu speaking Mbundu. It was the Portuguese who renamed the region as Angola after the royal title of Ngola.\nLater, between 1580 and 1670, the Portuguese made white settlements in Ndongo, which \nled to the breakup of the kingdom. But the Portuguese presence in Angola was limited only to around Luanda on the Atlantic Coast because of the continued anticolonial resistance put up by the local people. The good example is the extremely fascinating story about Queen Nzinga Mbande (1581-1663) of the Mbundu of Ndongo state. She was a skillful negotiator and military strategist, who led the early anti-colonial resistance of her people for four decades (1620s - 1660s), foiling many Portuguese attempts to capture or kill her.  After continuous war against the Portuguese, Nzinga signed a peace treaty with them in 1656, largely forcing them to agree to her own terms, and her policy continued until her death in 1663. \nThe Kingdom of Kongo suffered the same fate.

They were brought to slave market places by merchants of long-distance trade. West African Black slaves were brought to North Africa along the Trans-Saharan trade route. Slaves originating from the remote south western region of Ethiopia reached the Sudan and Egypt, North Africa or beyond. Another major long-distance trade route brought slaves and other trade items from the remotest central African interior to the Kingdom of Bakongo or Ndongo along the Atlantic coast. \nMale and female slaves in traditional African societies were used as domestic servants in palaces, \nreligious places and individual households. Besides, the acquisition of a greater number of slaves was a mark of prestige, power and status in African society. Female slaves could also become the wives and concubines of individuals, chiefs and kings. The price of female slaves was always higher than the price of male slaves. \nSlave labour was used in agriculture, including farming, animal rearing, hunting and fishing activities. \nBesides, slaves were employed in trade as porters, merchants or trading agents for individuals as well \nas for the state. They were also used in gold mining (like the Akan in West Africa), iron working, salt \nmaking (like Etsi and Borbor Fante of Ghana), cloth weaving and other art and craft industries.  In \naddition, slaves were recruited into the armies of traditional pre-colonial African states as soldiers, \ncamp f ollowers, body guards of kings and chiefs, or in rare cases, as commanders. In the field of ad -\nministration, slaves were highly needed in the palaces of African chiefs to serve as musicians, sword \nbearers, heralds, translators, financiers,  cookers, and so on."

This was common, for example, among the Tuareg in North Africa, the Bamba of Middle Niger, the Wolof of Senegambia, the Mende of Sierra Leone, the Ba-kongo and Lunda of central-west Africa, Kerebe of Tanzania, the Imbangala of Angola and Sena of Mozambique. African slaves were often regarded as part of the family.\n \nSlaves in African traditional societies had certain rights and privileges. They had the right to marry among themselves or marry free people. African slaves who farmed for their owners were also given plots of land on which to farm and obtain an independent income. Slaves could inherit property from their masters. The slave was entitled to legal protection. It was only the king, chief or the sultan who had power of life and death over the slaves and every other citizen of the state. Moreover, many African societies, including the Sena of Mozam -\nbique, the Kerebe of Tanzania, the Mende of Sierra Leone and the Kongo of central Africa granted slaves the privilege of manumission or redemption. Slaves also enjoyed some social and political mobility. In many West African societies, including Hausa Fulani, Mande, Ibo, Yoruba and Kanuri a slave could become head of his own house, village head or chief. \nIn general, the treatment of slaves in pre-colonial African society depended on the owner, \nthe family and the household in which the slave resided. On the whole, oral and written records show a picture of humane treatment of slaves. Observers remarked that slavery in Africa was very different from that of Europe, North America and the West Indies. Never-theless, his/her status as slave was never entirely forgotten, regardless of the level of his/her social integration or social and political position. \nMap 6.5  Slave trade routes  before the Trans-Atlantic Slave"

The Trans \nSaharan, Red Sea and Indian Ocean slave trades were much older and existed long before the beginning of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. The Trans Saharan trade, which is known to have existed at least from 8\nth century AD to the late 16th century, was the trade in slaves \nand other items across the Sahara Desert between Mediterranean countries and sub-Saha-ran Africa. North African Arabs and Berbers were the major participants in this trade. One of the trade routes ran from Moroccan cities of Tagaza and Sijilmasa to the Niger Delta, and the other one from Ifriqya (now Tunisia) to the Lake Chad area. Salt was abundant in North Africa and the Sahara and was traded with gold and slaves from Western Africa. The Trans-Atlantic gold and slave trade was the most important factor for the rise and consol -\nidation of West African states. Later on, this trade also played a key role in preparing West Africa to participate in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. After the 16\nth century, Trans-Saharan \ntrade declined, but continued in a much-reduced form.  \nThe Red Sea slave trade was another trade with ancient origins. Slaves were taken from \ninland countries of the Red Sea such as the Ethiopian region and Nubia, and shipped to \nthe Middle East and India. The export of Ethiopian slaves through the Red Sea developed \nsignificantly, particularly during the 19th century. Some of the slaves in this trade were also \nsold to North Africa. \nThe Indian Ocean trade was one of the oldest trades in Africa. Slaves from the East African \ncoast were shipped either to the Middle East and India or to plantation islands in the Indian Ocean for centuries. But this trade operated on a fairly small scale until the second half of the 18\nth century. Slaves were mostly sent to Arabia and the Persian Gulf as household \nservants, concubines, or plantation labourers.\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, however, the Indian Ocean slave trade greatly in-\ncreased. One of the reasons for this increase in the demand for East African slaves was the \nopening of sugar and coffee plantations in the island colonies of Mauritius and Reunion in the 1770s by the French. Portuguese, Indian, Arab and Swahili merchants supplied slaves to the French plantation owners of the two islands. The Zambezi valley and the Mozambican interior were the main sources of slaves. Besides, Arab traders have dominated the coastal trade of East Africa since the expulsion of the Portuguese from the region at the end of the 17\nth century. In the 19th century, the Sultans of Zanzibar extended their influence along the \nEast African coast from Mogadishu to Mozambique. In the middle of the century, the East"

The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade\nWith the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1 492, a much more extensive slave trade from Africa started.  This trade, which lasted from the 16\nth to the mid-19th cen-\nturies, is known as the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. European nations established very large plantations and mining fields in North, Central and South America following the voyages of Christopher Columbus. Spain was the first country to establish huge plantations and mining fields in the New World, and other European nations followed suit. The various groups of Native Americans or Amerindians whom the Europeans called Red Indians were decimated by unfamiliar European diseases and were brutally massacred by Europeans during the time of resistance against them. The survivors were forced to work in European plantations and mining fields under appalling conditions. \nBecause most Amerindians died of European borne diseases, harsh treatment or atrocious \nsuppression of rebellion, severe shortage of free labour was created in the European plan -\ntations. The Europeans tried to solve the problem by enslaving white European criminals, political prisoners, and other unfortunate groups. However, the white slaves were small in number, unable to resist hardships and died of unfamiliar tropical diseases. At this critical point, Europeans began to look into Africa as a source of free labour for their plantations in the New World. African slaves were immune to most tropical diseases.\nThe Portuguese were the first Europeans to transport African slaves across the Atlantic. In \n1532, the first African captives were taken directly across the Atlantic and sold into slavery in the New World.  After the 1630s, the volume of trade in slaves increased with the in -\nvolvement of several European countries.  First the Dutch, then the French, the British and the Danes began to compete in earnest with the Portuguese for the slave trade following the rapid expansion of sugar plantations in Brazil and the Caribbean. In the course of the 18\nth century, Britain became the single largest exporter of African slaves. \nThe Trans-Atlantic slave trade passed through three distinct phases. The first phase, which \nlasted from the 15th to the last quarter of the 16th century, was commonly called the piratic \nslave trade. The slave hunters and dealers were individual merchants, adventurers, naviga-\ntors, or sea robbers with no European government involvement or support. The trade in slaves was low as Europeans were still more interested in gold."

The trade was entirely conducted by monopo -\nlistic slave trading companies. These companies were chartered by their respective European \ngovernments and were assisted by regular armed forces. They penetrated deep into African territories in order to hunt down Africans in large numbers or purchase war captives from African chiefs and families as slaves. The Kingdom of Kongo in the Angolan coast line and the “Slave Coast” in what is now the western coast of Nigeria were the major sources of slaves. Slave merchants and chartered companies made enormous profits from the trade in African slaves. Able bodied slaves purchased for 100 to 200 francs in Africa were sold for 1000-2000 francs in the New World. \nThe second phase of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade is also known as the triangular trade, \nbecause it formed one part of the triangular shaped international trade network that linked the three continents of Europe, Africa and Americas. West European merchants brought from Europe goods such as clothes, alcoholic beverages, metal wares and firearms to Africa to exchange them for slaves. Then, they transported African slaves across the Atlantic, and exchanged them with plantation owners for sugar, tobacco, rum and other products. They ship these raw materials to Western Europe and sold them at high prices. The triangular trade enabled western European nations to accumulate enormous wealth, which helped industrialize Western Europe beginning from the 18\nth century. \nThe third phase of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which was called the free trade, began in the second half of the 17\nth century. It was the period of consolidation and expansion of the \ntrade. In 1689, the British government passed a law that gave every individual in the British Empire the right of participation in any kind of business including the slave trade. Increas -\ning number of slave dealers involved in the trade on an individual basis. This incited fierce \ncompetition between the companies as well as among the individual traders."

Then, African slaves underwent a bitter hard -\nship on the voyage across the Atlantic, known as the Middle Passage. Perhaps as many as one sixth of African slaves died during the journey and their corpses were thrown into the ocean. In the plantations in the Americas the hardship of African slaves was life long.

The Abolition of the Slave Trade\nAfricans resisted their enslavement, and revolted in the middle passage as well as at the \nplantation sites in the New World. Some African ruling elite and West African abolitionists abroad also resisted the atrocious enslavement of their people. But African resistance was poorly organized, and rebellions were often atrociously suppressed. \nFurther, with the growth of the Abolitionist Movement in Europe, the volume of the \nTrans-Atlantic slave trade started to show a marked decline. As the slave trade reached its apex in the late 18\nth century, more and more Europeans began to show their concern about \nimmorality and brutality of the trade. Religious people, humanitarians and others motivated by the ideals of the French Revolution and the Enlightenment put pressure on their govern -\nments to abolition the slave trade. However, European governments ignored the pressure of the abolitionists.  \nThe most important factors leading to the abolition of the slave trade were associated with \neconomic reasons. Plantation production and the trade in slaves became unprofitable with the development of the Industrial Revolution in Western Europe and North America.  Eu -\nropean governments outlawed slave trading by their citizens: Denmark in 1803, Britain in 1807 , the United States in 1808, Sweden in 1813, the Netherlands in 181 4, and France in 1818. Britain, in particular, took the most significant action against the slave trade. British naval forces patrolled the Atlantic Ocean to ensure the enforcement of anti-slave trade laws. This was the result of British industrialization. British economic interests shifted from the slave trade to the search for cheap labour power, raw materials and new markets for its industrial products. Thus, Africa`s manpower had to remain in Africa to be used in mining fields in the continent. The abolition campaign also had remarkable impacts on most parts of Africa. Consequently, the Trans-Atlantic slave trade declined in the middle of the 19\nth \ncentury.\nThis does not mean, however, that slavery was totally abandoned in Africa. In addition to \ndomestic slavery, African slaves were exported to Arabia, North Africa and the Far East until the early 20\nth century. It took time for colonial powers to ban slavery within their respective \nAfrican colonies. The indigenous system of slavery was abolished in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) in 1874 and in Ashante and others in 1908 by the British in 1874. In Ethiopia slavery and slave trade continued until the coming of the Italians in 1935."

The Effects of Slave Trade on Africa\nOf the different types of slave trade practiced on the continent, the largest and best record -\ned was the trans-Atlantic slave trade. In total, nearly 18 million slaves were shipped in the \nfour slave trades between 1500 and 1900. Of this amount, the share of the Trans-Atlantic trade is estimated to be 12 million Black Africans from the entire Atlantic coasts of the continent and Mozambique in the south east.  \nThe centuries old slave trade in African slaves in common had a number of consequences. \nBut it is difficult to mention all of them. To some African peoples, the slave trade resulted in their extermination; to others, in their expulsion from their ancestral territories; and to others, in the loss of their sons and daughters or dislocation of families; and to the rest, in the destruction of their economies and retardation of the development of productive forces.  \nThe Atlantic trade, in particular, resulted in the complete destruction of some small ethnic \ngroups. Others, like the Yoruba and Wolof of West Africa, suffered from political instability. Still, other societies, like Benin were involved in the trade and were slightly affected by it. Elsewhere on the continent, large regions, like most of the present-day Republic of South Africa, were not involved in the Atlantic trade at all. From the economic point of view, the slave trade drained the productive potential of Africa. The drain of masses of manpower and the direct or indirect compulsion to produce goods required by foreign traders largely prevented African masses from producing what they themselves needed. The prevalence of conflict and warfare during enslavement led to the disruption of local agricultural activities and food production. \nThe Trans-Atlantic slave trade served as a factor in the rise and consolidation of the Guin -\nea states of Dahomey, Ashante and Oyo. They may have profited from their participation \nin the slave trade, which helped them to become powerful.  Some African chiefs actively participated in the slave traffic. In these areas, particularly in West Africa, the slave trade accelerated the rise of new African merchant classes.  The centuries` long continuous suffer -\ning and incessant defensive wars of coastal African peoples against European slave dealers developed African fighting sprite and experience of warfare. It led to the consolidation of tribal confederation and military organization. \nActivity 6.5  \n1. Why were slaves acquired by many African households?\n2.

The Legitimate Trade\nLearning Competencies: After learning this lesson, you will be able to:\n\tunderstand the nature of African and European relationships after the abolish-\nen of the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade;\n\trealize the nature of the legitimate trade.\nBrainstorming Questions\n•\tWhy did the Europeans shift from the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade to the legitimate trade? \nAs Europeans gradually outlawed the slave trade, they found West Africa as a fertile ground for what they referred to as the “Legitimate Trade”. During the first half of the 19\nth century, a \nrange of West African commodities replaced the export of slaves. Production was organized by West African rulers and merchants, who often made use of internal slave labour for cash-crop plantations and for transport.  Exports included gum Arabic from Senegal. Gum Arabic was used in the European textile industries for fixing coloured dyes in printed cloth.  Other exports were groundnuts from Guinea and palm oil from most of the coastal forest \nzones. \nBy the middle of the 19th century, palm oil had become West Africa`s major overseas export.  \nIt was the main source of lubricant for Europe’s industrial machinery before the development \nof Petroleum oil. \nNevertheless, the establishment of “legitimate trade” did not allow African states to \ndevelop their own economic strength and independence. In the first place, those who \nbenefited from the trade were a small minority of wealthy rulers and merchants.  There \nwas little improvement in the social  and economic well-being of the bulk of the popula -\ntion.  Secondly, the principal imports from Europe (cloth, alcohol and fire arms) did noth -\ning to strengthen indigenous African economies.  As the century progressed, European \ntraders, backed up by their governments, made increasing efforts to control West Africa`s internal trade.  They sought to maximize their profits by cutting out both the African mid -\ndle men and their European competitors.  It was this heightened level of European trading competition which, in part, led to the ‘Scramble for Africa’ in the 1870s and 1880s."

The White Settlement in South Africa \nLearning Competencies: After learning this lesson, you will be able to:\n\tidentify the circumstances under which the Whites settled in South Africa;\n\tanalyse the causes of conflicts in South Africa.\nBrainstorming Question\n•\tWhat do you think was the primary motive of the Whites in settling in South Africa?\nOne of the most important consequences of the exploration of a new sea route rounding \nAfrica to reach the Far East was the emergence of South Africa as a place of white settle -\nment. In 1652, the Dutch East Indian Company established a small permanent settlement at the Cape of Good Hope. The aim of the company was to regularize the meat trade with the indigenous Khoisan people and grow fresh fruits and vegetables to supply passing Eu-ropean ships and provide a hospital for sick sailors. The company also established a military fortress to protect itself from attacks by rival European naval forces and the Khoisan.  \nWith the aim of expanding the provisioning trade, in 1657 the Dutch company made some \nof its soldiers permanently settle farmers known in Dutch as Boers (farmers), later called Afrikaners. To work on the farms the company initially imported slaves from West Africa. The Boers` settlement on Khoisan grazing lands and cattle raids by them led to the first Khoi-Dutch war in 1659. However, as a result of the lack of unity among the Khoisan clans, they were eventually defeated and the company claimed all their lands. \nThe second Khoisan-Dutch war was fought in 1673-77 , in which a series of cattle raids \nwere carried out against more organized and stronger Khoisan clans. The war very much weakened the Khoisan and the company got large booty of cattle and sheep. Besides, the settlement of Boers expanded rapidly. The company promoted immigration from Europe, and by 1700, the white population permanently settled in the Cape reached a thousand. By then, the colony had grown enough wheat and fruit (especially grapes for wine) to feed itself and export the surplus. Thousands of slaves imported from Madagascar (now Mala-gasy), Mozambique and Indonesia worked on the farms owned by the Boers. By the end of the 18\nth century, slave population in the Cape colony reached 25000, while the total white \npopulation was 21000. \nMeanwhile, in the early decades of the 18th century, the survival of the Khoisan was threat -"

At the same time, the Khoisan perished in thousands as a result of the spread of smallpox epidemics introduced to the Cape by European sailors.  \nDuring the period from 1700 to 17 60 the Boers expanded eastwards into Zulu lands. This \nled to a long series of wars between the trek Boers and Xhosa (Zulu) beginning from 1779. The Cape colony was taken over by Britain in 1795. Dissatisfied with British rule, the Boers moved further north across the Vaal and Orange Rivers in the 1830s, and 1840s. This is known as the “Great Trek”. Consequently, the four Boer colonies of the Cape, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange Free were created. The Zulus came into conflict with both the British and Boers in South Africa. The discovery of mineral deposits in the 1860s attracted a large number of white settlers in South Africa. At the end of the 19\nth century, Britain took \ncontrol of all the four South African colonies. \nMap 6.7 Great Treks of Boers\nThe situation in South Africa has become much more extreme. Superior forces had enabled \nthe settlers to occupy much of the better agricultural land. The much more numerous indig-enous Bantu and Khoisan speaking inhabitants have been pushed into less favorable or less accessible lands. In time, they served as a reservoir of cheap labor for the settling economy."

In order to get maximum \nbenefit from this trade, Europeans needed sufficient information about Africa`s potential as a source of raw materials, cheap labour and new markets for European manufactured goods. In 1788, a group of wealthy and influential Englishmen formed the “African Association”. Their aim was to send an expedition to visit the city of Timbuktu and to investigate the course of the Niger River.\nBetween 1788 and 1877 , an enormous number of European explorers set out into the heart \nof Africa to improve their knowledge of Africa. But only some of them were successful. In the 1850s and 1860s, Richard Burton, John Hanning Speke and James Grant were the three \nEuropean explorers who traced the source of the White Nile to Lake Victoria and showed \nthe river`s navigable possibilities upstream from Khartoum.\nSimilarly, the former missionary, Dr. David Livingston (d.1873), visited the Zambezi River and \nlater explored the area from the Shire River to lakes Malawi. He also led several expeditions \nto the Lake and river systems of South-Central Africa. The explorer Henry Morton Stanley \ncompleted Livingston’s work by sailing down the Zaire (Congo) from its upper tributary in 187 6. His exploration was significant because he had shown the navigability of the Zaire \nRiver. The Belgian king, Leopold II, had shown a particular interest on Stanley`s exploration \nand sent him back to the Zaire River basin in 1879. In this way, European explorers paved the way for the colonial control of Africa.\nBy the 1860s, the French on the Senegal River had established a narrow riverine colony. \nSimilarly, the British government declared the Fante states a Crown Colony when the king -\ndom of Asante challenged the British trading monopoly on the Gold Coast. The British position in this coastal colony was further secured by a military victory over the Ashante"

The real motive behind those great explorations was commercial interest and \nthe desire to control the natural wealth of Africa. \nNevertheless, until the second half of the 19th century, European exploration did not show \nsignificant progress. This was due to the high mortality of Europeans from malaria fever. \nIt was since the early 1850s, when the Quinine was discovered and provided reasonable protection from malaria fever, that European exploration of Africa was quickened.\nThe main concern of European exploration in the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s was to discover \nthe courses of the major rivers of Africa mainly the Upper Nile, the Zambezi and the Zaire. This intense interest in Africa`s rivers was not fired simply by detached scientific curiosity. \nThe rivers of Africa were viewed by Europeans as the primary trading arteries to and from \nthe interior areas of the continent. They were the ‘high ways’ through which Europeans \ncould ‘open up’ the continent to European trade and exploitation.\nIn the course of the 19\nth century, a large number of European missionaries also came to Af -\nrica. The most important were the British-based Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS) \nand the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society or London Missionary Society (LMS). Be -\nsides, Protestant missionaries came from France, Germany, Holland and the United States. French Catholic missions, too, came later towards the end of the century.\nSince the early 19\nth century, European missionaries have conducted successful missionary \nactivities in West Africa, (e.g. Sierra Leone and Liberia) and Southern Africa. It was among \nfreed slaves, the poor and dispossessed communities of Khoisan and mixed-race peoples \nthat LMS and Moravian missionaries founded their most successful early missions.  Beyond \nthe borders of the Cape Colony, missionaries were often welcomed for their technical and \nliterary enterprise and their access to firearms. The missionaries themselves valued the op-\nportunity to act as chief advisers.\nApart from these places, by the third quarter of the 19th century, the Christian mission was \nmaking slow progress. Mission stations were still largely confined to coastal regions, work -\ning among Africans already in cultural contact with Europeans through trading activities. \nBy the 1880s, the number of Christian converts was less than one percent of non-Muslim \nAfricans, excluding Ethiopia. It was largely because of this relative lack of initial success that missionaries appealed to European governments` intervention to help change African \nsociety and make it more open to missionary enterprise.\nIn a number of cases, Christian missionaries played a significant role in promoting and \nshaping the advent of European colonialism. In the final quarter of the 19\nth century in par-\nticular, European missionaries appealed to their home governments for various degrees of"

Because of their own wider strategic and commer-cial interests, European governments’ response to these appeals was positive. For instance, in Namibia in the early 1880’s, German missionaries appealed to their government for ‘protection’ because there was a territorial conflict between the Nama and Herero peoples that destroyed the missionaries` settlement in Namibia. It was due to this that the German government declared a “protectorate” over South West Africa in 1884. \nIn the scramble for Southern Africa, British missionaries played an active part in promoting \nthe extension of British imperial control. They saw this as preferable to white-settler control \nfrom colonial South Africa. When the Christian missionaries in Buganda were threatened \nbecause of the existence of a civil war in the area, they appealed to Britain. The Anglican \nCMS, fearing for the survival of their mission in Buganda, set about raising money in Britain. \nThis was used to pay for half the cost of maintaining a British military force in the country from 1890 to 189 1. The CMS action undoubtedly saved their mission promoted Protestant Christianity and helped smooth the way for the formal declaration of the British “Protector -\nate” of Uganda in 1894. \n Activity 6.6  \n1.

The period beginning from 1270 to 1855 is also generally known as the medieval period of Ethiopian history. Around 1270, the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia got a new dynasty that replaced the Zagwe dynasty. With the development of Long-Distance trade and the spread of Islam in the region, a number of Muslim sultanates also flourished along the trade routes. In addition, the resourceful south and western Ethiopian regions consisted of a number of other peoples and states where the people practiced various forms of indigenous religion. The 16\nth century history of the region was characterized by the coming of Jesuit \nmissionaries and the Oromo population movement.\nLearning Outcomes : After learning this unit, students will be able to:\n\tpoint out the distinguishing features of the Solomonic Dynasty;\n\tanalyze the role of trade as a source of conflict in the medieval period Ethiopian region;\n\tdraw a map of the Ethiopian region which shows the extent of influence of the \nChristian kingdom;\n\tappreciate the positive achievements of the restored Solomonic Dynasty.\nKey Terms and Concepts\n7 .1 The Christian Kingdom under the Restored “Solomonic” Dynasty (1270s –1550s)\nLearning Competencies: After learning this lesson, you will be able to:\n §evaluate the main factors that led to the restoration of the “Solomonic” Dynasty; ÊLegitimacy  \n ÊRivalry             ÊStone enclosure                        \n ÊIndigenous religion                        ÊSupermacy                \n ÊGadaa system"

By then, Amhara constituted the present day southern Wollo and northern Shewa. The Amhara ruling classes took away political power from the Zagwe around 1270. A local ruler in Amhara named Yikuno Amlak (r. 1270-85) founded a new dynasty. The new dynasty was called the “Solomonic” dynasty. This also marked the beginning of the Ethiopian Medieval Period (1270-1855). \nKing Yikuno Amlak and his followers took this dynastic name to justify their legitimacy. To that end, he resorted to the legend of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon to whom he claimed descent through the last Aksumite king, Dil Naod. Yukono Amlak used this legend to show the people that the Zagwe rulers were “illegitimate” to the political power. Hence, Yikuno Amlak and his followers considered themselves the “restorers” of the ancient dynasty. All these things were enshrined in a 1 4\nth century book called “Kibre Negest” (the Glory of Kings).  The new \ndynasty was influential and, even though it is a legend, its claim was generally accepted by the people. All the monarchs who ruled the Christian kingdom until 1974, regardless of their ac -\ntual origin, claimed descent from the family of Yikuno Amlak. This means that the “Solomonic” dynasty lasted for over 700 years. \nNB: Concerning the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon of Israel, refer unit three that speaks about Judaism.\nThe capital of the Christian highland kingdom was shifted from Lalibela in Lasta to the area of Lake Hayk in Medieval Amhara. Gradually, the Christian state shifted its center to Shewa. But later, “moving” or “roving” capitals characterized the Christian state in which the royal court moved from one district to another in the eastern foot hills of the Shewan \nplateau."

When Yikuno Amlak assumed power \nin about 1270, the territorial extent of the Christian Highland Kingdom was almost limited \nto the former possessions of the Zagwe state. Various Muslim and non-Muslim states and peoples also independently existed on the eastern, southern and southwestern frontiers of the kingdom. To mention a few, the Felasha lived along the northwestern frontier. Beyond the Abay River, there was the predominantly Agew inhabited kingdom of Gojjam. The kingdom of Damot was situated in the vast region southwest of the Christian highland kingdom. The kind of relationship the Christian highland kingdom had with these various states and peoples during the reigns of Yikuno Amlak and his immediate successors is not clearly known. But it seems to have been true that it was based on trade relations and the slow expansion of the Christian Church. \nHowever, with the coming to power of King Amde Tsiyon (r.13 1 4-44), grandson of Yikuno \nAmlak, the Christian highland kingdom started vigorous territorial expansion. Amde Tsiyon was the most expansionist king of the medieval period. Consequently, a long period of con -\nflict and war affected the Ethiopian region and the Horn of Africa. But the influence of the Christian state in the Ethiopian region was very strong in the later centuries, until it relapsed in the early 16\nth century with the rise of the Adal under Imam Ahmad. \nThe large-scale territorial expansion of the Christian highland kingdom was accompanied by the further expansion of the Orthodox Church. At the time of the rise to power of Yikuno Amlak, the Church had already been strongly established in Tigray, Wag, Lasta, An -\ngot and Amhara. During his successors’ tenure, the church further expanded into Shewa, Gojjam, Begemdir, and in the region around Lake Tana. \nIn the early period of the ‘Solomonic’ dynasty, agriculture was the basis of the economy \nof the Christian highland kingdom, which was dominated by mixed farming.  Most of the members of agrarian communities were prosperous with large families. These families also kept slaves as household servants. Beginning in the 1 4\nth century, the Ethiopian version of \nfeudalism was consolidated as a political and economic system. The records of the period show that in the medieval period, the kings made land grants to officials in return for mili -\ntary or administrative services."

During the period between 1270 and 1529, Zeyla replaced the Red Sea coast as the main gateway for internal and external trade in the region. Because of this, sometimes the trade is called the Zeyla trade. Most of the trade items like ivory and gold originated from the western and southwestern Ethiopian regions. Cereals and fruits of the highlands were also highly demanded in the lowlands on both sides of the Red Sea. The Zeyla trade was significantly controlled by Muslim merchants. Revenue collected from import and export trade was a source of income for the kings of the Christian highland kingdom. They themselves participated in the trade, organized and financed big caravans led by their trade agents. \nThe development of long-distance trade in the Ethiopian region had other far-reaching \nimpacts. Through trade, various peoples and states in the Ethiopian region were intercon -\nnected and developed a sense of economic interdependence. Besides, trade routes which crisscrossed the Ethiopian region and the Horn of Africa resulted in the exchange of various social and cultural values among the diverse peoples of the region. However, the desire to monopolize long distance trade in the region led to frequent clashes between the Christian highland Kingdom and the Sultanates of the region. \nMap 7 .1 Major trade routes in the Ethiopian Region, 1332-1527\nAnother most important feature of the period was the consolidation of the feudal mode of production in the Ethiopian context.

In order to effectively administer the vast empire which came into existence, the kings \nmaintained both hereditary chiefs and appointed their own officials. In some regions, the hereditary ruling classes were allowed to remain in power under the close supervision of the central government. In other regions, officials were royally appointed by the king and sent to the newly incorporated areas with a large number of soldiers. The new administra -\ntive and military officials were given the right to collect tribute from the local peoples over whom they were appointed. This system was called the Gult system. Gult was a right to levy tribute on the owners of Rist land and its produce. Rist was a hereditary right to land use by members of families and clans whose ancestors retained the land for a long period of time. \nThe Bale Gult (Gult right owner) enjoyed a number of economic and political privileges \nover the peasants under him/her. For example, he/she was responsible for the collection of tribute in kind including grains, cattle, honey, butter, salt, household equipment, etc. from the peasants. The Bale Gult retained most of the tribute for him/her, and sent part of it to the central state. The Bale Gult could use the corvee (free labour) of the people under his/her rule. Moreover, as a local governor, the Bale Gult was responsible for the maintenance of law and order in his region. He/she also acted as a chief judge and gave administrative justice to the local people. It was also obligatory for the Bale Gult to raise a regional army from among the Rist land owners and command them during a time of regional or na -\ntional crisis. The Gult system greatly simplified the task of administering the vast Christian highland kingdom of the period. This system remained to be the predominant feature of Ethiopian feudalism up to the 1974 Revolution. \nThe mobile nature of the royal court was another main feature of the medieval period \nChristian highland kingdom of Ethiopia. Unlike Aksum and Lalibela, from 1270 until the establishment of Gondar in 1636, there was no permanent capital city. Instead, the kings ruled from moving or roving capitals. The districts of Shewa, such as Menz, Tegulet, Bulga, Yarar, Intoto, Menagesha, Wachacha, Furi and Zikuala served as temporary centers of royal encampment. They moved from one region to another, followed by their court officials, soldiers and other camp followers. The kings and their dignitaries lived in tents, while other camp followers lived in temporary huts. As a result, there were no permanent structures like palaces and castles.  \nThe royal court constantly moved from region to region during the period, partly to obtain \nfresh supplies or provisions for the large number of camp followers and partly due to a shortage of fire wood. But they also moved to control rebellions by making their seats at nearby sites. As a result, there was relative peace and stability in the Christian highland"

Moving capital also had a negative consequence on the environment. In fact, after the middle of the 15\nth century, some of the kings tried to stay at one place for many \nyears.

One of the causes of this instability was the power struggle among the sons \nand grandsons of Yikuno Amlak. The problem of succession was so intense, particularly between 1294 and 1299 that five successive kings briefly came to power. \nThe problem of succession was resolved when the mountain fortress of Amba Gishen or \nDebre Negest (Mountain of Kings) was established around 1300. All the male descendants of Yikuno Amlak, except his sons, were kept aloof on the flat-topped mountain of Amba Gishen. They could receive education, work on the land and even marry, but they could not leave the Amba. The passes and foothills of the mountain were guarded by warriors loyal to the reigning king. This system facilitated smooth successions and helped for the consol -\nidation of the Christian state. The practice continued until Amba Gishen was destroyed by Imam Ahmad of Adal in 1540.  7 .1.3 Power Struggle, Consolidation, and Territorial and Religious Expansion                    \nof the Christian Highland Kingdom"

They in -\ncluded Tigray, Lasta, Bete-Amhara and Shewa. With the coming to power of king Amde \nTsiyon (r. 13 1 4-44), however, the Christian highland kingdom started rapid territorial expan-sion. He was the most expansionist king of the medieval period. Amde Tsiyon incorporated the kingdoms of Damot in 13 16/17 , Felasha between Dembiya and the Tekeze in 1332 and Gojjam in 1323/24. The conquest of these kingdoms gave Amde Tsiyon an important source of manpower and trade items, which further strengthened his power. In the 1320s Amde Tsiyon further consolidated his power by extending his conquests to the provinces of the north as far as Massawa. In what is now Eritrea, he appointed a governor with the title of Ma`ikele Bahr (later, Bahire Negash).\nThe initial successes of Amde Tsiyon prepared the ground for the major wars against the \nMuslim Sultanates. Ifat was the most powerful of all the Sultanates. At the time, Ifat extend -\ned its hegemony over other Sultanates between the highland and the coast, along which the Zeyla trade routes passed. Because of this, Ifat threatened the economic interests of the Christian highland kingdom. It also harassed and detained travelers and messengers to and from the kingdom. With the aim of bringing an end to this threat, Amde Tsiyon prepared for war cautiously. Amde Tsiyon waited until he could find a pretext to start a conflict with Ifat. \nTowards the end of 1325, the sultan of Ifat named Haqq ad-Din I arrested the commercial \nagent of the king. At that time, Ifat was not prepared for war, and Amde Tsiyon`s attack took it by surprise in 1328. Amde Tsiyon`s army gained an easy victory, after which many villages, including the town of Ifat, were plundered and burnt. \nHaqq ad-Din`s son and successor, Daradir, opened a massive offensive on the frontier ter -\nritories of the Christian highland kingdom. In one of the battles that followed, Daradir de-\nfeated the Imperial army. But in another reengagement his army was defeated, and Daradir himself was captured and killed. \nIn the south, Amde Tsiyon had already annexed the Sultanate of Hadya in about 13 17 . \nAlthough Hadya paid tribute to the Christian highland kingdom, effective rule had not been established there. Thus, encouraged by Muslim merchants, the Garad (ruler) of Hadya named Amano rebelled against Amde Tsiyon. He stopped sending the annual tribute which indicated his revolt. Amde Tsiyon reacted immediately by leading a strong army that de -\nstroyed Hadya and took many prisoners, including Amano. Consequently, Hadya was re -"

They reacted by forming a united front \nagainst Amde Tsiyon. The leader of this alliance was the ruler of Ifat named Sabr ad-Din I (fl. 1332) who launched his attack in 1332. However, in the final battle the army of Ifat was completely defeated and Sabr ad-Din escaped to the neighbouring Sultanate of Dawaro. Then, Amde Tsiyon marched to Dawaro, where he succeeded in capturing Sabr ad-Din and imprisoning him. In the afterwards, Ifat was no longer a powerful sultanate in the region, and it was reduced to tributary status. The Christian highland state successively appointed its officials over Ifat and a large military garrison was stationed there. \nAfter 1332, Amde Tsiyon continued his campaigns against other Sultanates along the Zeyla \ntrade routes. He reduced them one after the other to tributary status. By 1344, when Amde Tsiyon died, the Christian highland kingdom covered a very vast area that included the Sultanates of the southeast. On the other hand, the Walasma rulers of Ifat left the sultanate, and moved further east to the lowlands, where they eventually established a new sultanate called Adal around 1380. Adal became the new center of challenge to the predominance of the Christian highland kingdom. The struggle against it started during the reign of Haqq ad-Din II (r.1363/64-87), who extended his power over other sultanates around Adal. In the 1380s, Haqq ad-Din opened a massive offensive against King Dawit I (r. 1382-1 413). Initially, Haqq ad-Din scored a series of victories. However, this did not last long as the Sul -\ntanate of Adal was defeated in 1387 in which Haqq ad-Din himself was killed. The struggle against the Christian highland kingdom continued under the next sultan of Adal named Sa`ad ad-Din II (r. 1387-1 403). But Adal faced another defeat in the early 15\nth century. \nSa`ad ad-Din escaped from the battle field, but the imperial army pursued and killed him in Zeyla in 1 403. His sons took refuge in Yemen. The power of Adal was weakened and, for the next thirty years, there was no serious challenge to the Christian highland kingdom. \nThe power of the Sultanate of Adal revived once again in the 1 430s, under Sultan Ahmed \nBadlay, who became one of the most powerful sultans of Adal. He resumed the struggle against the Christian highland state. As a result, King Yishak (r. 1 413-30) marched to Adal to bring an end to Ahmad Badlay`s resistance. However, Yishak died in 1 430 without achieving his goal. Then, Sultan Ahmad organized a united front of the Sultanates of the lowlands against King Zer`a Ya`ekob (r. 1 434-68). He also won the support of Mahiko, who was the then Garad of Hadya. Although Zer`a Ya`ekob initially faced serious military set -"

This marked the peak of the predominant position of the Christian highland Kingdom in the Ethiopian region and the Horn. \nThe predominant power of the Christian highland kingdom began to decline during the \nlast quarter of the 15\nth century. Zer`a Ya`ekob suppressed internal revolts and successfully \nrepulsed military offensives of the sultanates of Adal and Hadya. By contrast, his successor, Be`ede Mariyam (r. 1 468-1 478) was not powerful enough to push back the growing pres-sure from the sultanates. Indeed, it was during the reign of Be`ede Mariyam that the Imperial army faced its first serious defeat. Eventually, the decline of the Christian highland state led to the emergence of Adal as a hegemonic power in the Ethiopian region and the Horn. In March 1529, a coalition of Muslim low landers led by Imam Ahmad of Adal utterly defeat -\ned King Libne Dingil`s (r. 1508-40) army at the battle of Shimbra Kure.  \nReligious Expansion\nThe territorial expansion of the Christian highland kingdom during the medieval period was accompanied by the further expansion of the Christian church. Under the ‘Solomon -\nic’ dynasty Christianity revived in Shewa centered at the monastery of Debre Asbo (later renamed as Debre Libanos) which was founded by Abune Tekle Haymanot. He converted King Motalami of the kingdom of Damot to Christianity. Besides, there was an earlier mon -\nastery of Hayk Istifanos which was opened by Abba Iyasus Moa. Since then, monasticism has become a dominant practice in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. \nLater, Christianity spread into the areas south and west of Shewa by the disciples of Abune \nTekle Haymanot and Abba Iyasus Mo`a. This included the kingdoms of Gojjam, Damot, Enarya and Wajj.  In addition to the age old northern Ethiopian monastic centers, a number of other monasteries and churches were established in many areas of the Ethiopian region in the 1 4\nth and 15th centuries. The number of monasteries on the islands of Lake Ziway and \nLake Tana are worth mentioning. \nThe evangelization process in the newly incorporated territories was usually assisted by the \nstate. Kings supported the construction of churches and large monasteries, and granted them large tracts of land. The clergy, in turn, played a big role in preaching about Christian -\nity and the legitimacy of Christian kings. This church-state alliance reached its peak during the reign of King Zera Ya`ekob (r. 1 434-68)."

Rather, it was mainly limited \nto the Red Sea coastal territories.\nThe most important gateway for the spread of Islam into the interior of the region was, \ntherefore, the port of Zeyla on the Gulf of Aden. Several trade routes from the interior of the region run in the direction of this port. Thus, Arab and non-Arab Muslim merchants were the agents of the expansion of Islam. These merchants established important market centers along the Zeyla trade routes leading to the interior. They stayed in these market centers sometimes to exchange the items they brought from South Arabia with the locally available items. As these merchants stayed longer in these market centers, they underwent a considerable interaction with the local pastoral communities whom they gradually convert -\ned to Islam. Apparently, it was in this process that Islam was peacefully introduced to Harar, Eastern Shewa, Wollo, Bale, Arsi and other regions of the interior. \nThe spread of Islam and the development of long dsitance trade in the region led to the \nestablishment of a series of Muslim Sultanates along the Zeyla trade routes in th interior. The most important were Shewa, Ifat, Fatagar, Dawaro, Darha (Dera), Bali, Hadya, Arababni, Sharkha and Adal. As discussed in unit three, Shewa was the earliest of all the Muslim Sultanates. Their rulers used the title of sultan, and hence,these Muslim states are called sultanates. Muslim Sultanates of the region shared many features in common, such as: \n\tTheir population was made up of Muslim communities. \n\tTheir rulers exercised both religious and political powers. \n\tIslam and trade were the main factors in their emergence.\n\tMost of them were located in the southeastern lowlands of the Ethiopian region. \n\tAlthough some of their communities practiced mixed farming, the economy of the Sultanates mainly depended on trade. \nAt the same time, however, each sultanate developed in its own unique ways. The accounts of Arab writers like al- Ummeri and Christian literature illustrate the internal history of the Medival Muslim states of the Ethiopia region.\n7 .2.1. Trade and Trade Routes                   \nZeyla was the most important trade outlet for both the Christian highland Kingdom and the Sultanates during the medieval period.

Umar Walasma, who was the contem-\nporary of King Yikuno Amlak of the Christian highland kingdom, was the first historically \nknown ruler of the Sultanate. Hence, the ruling dynasty of Ifat was called Walasma. The Sul -\ntanate of Ifat attained military and political prominence under Umar Walasma, and subdued \nand incorporated the Sultanate of Shewa in 1385. \nIfat was situated in a strategic area through which the Zeyla trade routes passed into the \ninterior of the Ethiopian region. This strategic position enabled Ifat to monopolize the trade in the region. Besides, the local communities in the area where Ifat flourished were converted to Islam.

However, it lost this dominant position when the Christian \nkingdom under King Amde Tsiyon started vigorous territorial expansion. Ifat`s Sultan Sabr ad-Din fought many battles to retain the power of Ifat in the lowlands. But, he was finally deafted in 1332, after which Ifat became a tributary state to the Christian highland king -\ndom. \nThe Sultanate of Hadya\nHadya was one of the medieval period Sultanates of the Ethiopian region. The exact time when Hadya was founded is not clearly known. The Sultanate is mentioned for the first time in the chronicle of King Amde Tsiyon. Among the Muslim Sultanates, Hadya occupied the most westerly territory in the Ethiopian region. The western frontiers of Hadya touched the Gibe River. In the southwest, the territory of the sultanate reached around the Gibe river. In the south, its territory seems to have stretched up to Lake Hawasa, while in the north it extended a little to the north of Lake Ziway. \nIt is known that the original inhabitants of the Sultanate were the ancestors of the present \nHadya ethnic group. Its rulers held the title of Garad. The economy of Hadya was based mainly on mixed farming. But some sections of its population led a purely pastoral way of life. Trade also contributed a lot to the economy of the Sultanate. \nThe Sultanate of Hadya possessed rich natural resources. Partly because of its natural wealth, \nthe kings of the Christian highland kingdom sought to reduce Hadya to its tributary. In the 1330s, King Amde Tsiyon made Hadya a tributary state along with other Sultanates in the reg\nion. Nevertheless, Hadya, led by its Garads, rebelled now and then against imperial rule. \nAs a result, the kings of the Christian highland kingdom occassionally led punitive expe -\nditions to retain the tributary status of Hadya. They even tried to secure the loyalty of the rulers of Hadya by means of political marriage.  Sources indicate that Queen Mother Elleni belonged to the ruling family of Hadya.  She played a crucial role in the politicts of the Christian highland kingdom during the second half of the 15\nth and early decades of the 16th \ncenturies. Kings Be`ede Mariyam (r. 1 468-78) and Libne Dingil (r. 1508-40) were also offi -\ncially married to the princesses of Hadya. Other members of the ruling class of the Christian highland kingdom also followed the example of the kings and married women from Hadya. Yet, Hadya continued to rebel against imperial rule at different times. The last rebellion of Hadya was during the reign of King Sertse Dingil (r. 1563-97), who permanently abandoned the Sultanate because of increasing pressure from the expanding M\nacha Oromo."

We do \nnot have clear evidence as to when Bali emerged as a state. The population of the medie -\nval Sultanate of Bali seems to have consisted of different ethnic groups. Bali was the most southerly located Sultanate. Except for the southern frontier, Bali was surrounded by various other Sultanates. To the north of Bali existed the Sultanates of Dawaro and Sharka. It was separated from Dawaro by the Wabi Shabale River. In the west, there was Hadya, while the eastern frontier was occupied by the Sultanate of Adal. The southern limit of the territory of Bali is not clearly known. Bali is mentioned in the chronicles of Christian kings beginning with Amde Tsiyon. Since then, the Garads of Bali paid tribute to the Christian highland kingdom until the 16\nth century. \nThe Sultanate of Sharkha\nSharkha was a small Sultanate which was situated north of Bali and west of Dawaro. The ter -\nritory of this Sultanate roughly corresponded with present day Arsi. One of Sharkha`s early inhabitants were some groups of Oromo and ancestors of the present day Halaba ethnic group. The exact time at which Sharkha emerged as a state is not known.  Beginning from the reign of Amde Tsiyon, Sharkha was a tributary state of the Christian highland kingdom. In the first quarter of the 16\nth century, it was controlled by the army of Imam Ahmad.  \nThe Sultanate of Dawaro\nDawaro existed south of Fatagar, and in the north it was bordered by Ifat on the right bank of the Awash River. In the south Dawaro stretched as far as the Wabi Shabale River, bor -\ndering Bali. Dawaro, therefore, roughly corresponded with present day Arsi region. Some groups of Oromo and the ancestors of the Sidama ethnic group are known to have settled in the Sultanate of Dawaro. The Dawro people trace their origins to this Sultanate.

Kings of the Christian highland kingdom used Darha as a place of exile \nfor disobedient monks, who were forced to stay for some times among unfriendly Muslim populations as a punishment. \nThe Sultanate of Fatagar\nFatagar emerged along the Zeyla trade route around the mid-13th century. Fatagar existed in \nthe region between Lake Ziway in the south and the present day Bishoftu area in the north.The territory of Fatagar also included the present-day territories of Minjar, Shenkora, and Ada`a in Shewa. Fatagar became a tributary of the Christian kingdom during the reign of Amde Tsiyon. Later, it was reduced to the status of a province directly ruled by the kings of the Christian highland kingdom for almost a century. \nThe Sultanate of Arababni\nArababni was a small Sultanate about which we know only about its existence through the work of al-Ummeri. It existed south of the Awash River between the Sultanates of Hadya and Dawaro. Al- Ummeri further states that the agricultural products of the Sultanate in -\ncluded cereals, legumes and fruits. \nThe Sultanate of Adal\nThe Sultanate of Adal was founded by the Walasma rulers of Ifat towards the end of the 14\nth century. Once Ifat was annexed by Amde Tsiyon in 1332, and became tributary to \nthe Christian highland kingdom, its ruling class was divided into two groups. The first group, consisting of the merchant class, decided to recognize the authority of the Christian highland Kingdom over Ifat. The second group, the militant wing, however, opposed this domination and was determined to regain the lost independence of Ifat. The Walasma ruler named Haqq ad-Din II (r. 1363/64-87) rebelled against Amde Tsiyon`s sons and succes -\nsors, Seyf Ar`ed (r. 1344- 7 1) and Newaye Mariyam (r. 137 1-80). However, Ifat was not favourable for military resistance because it was closer to the Christian highland Kingdom. Therefore, this militant group retreated further to the south eastern lowlands of Harar, where they founded the Sultanate of Adal around 1380 centered at Dakar, south east of Harar, but in 1520, it was shifted to Harar. Among others, Sa`ad ad-Din II (r. 1387-1 403), rebelled against King Dawit I (r. 1380-1 412). \nThe offensive of Adal grew strong, particularly during the time of Sultan Ahmad Badlay.

There is no clear \nevidence concerning the time when the Kingdom of Gojjam emerged. The kingdom was inhabited by the Agew ethnic group. In about 1323/24, King Amde Tsiyon (r. 13 1 4-44) campaigned against Gojjam and reduced it to tributary status. Monks from the Lake Tana Island monasteries and medieval Amhara gradually preached Christianity in Gojjam. Zhan Kimir was the king of Gojjam during the reign of Amde Tsiyon. He and a local Agaw ruler of the Lake Tana area named Zhan Chuhay apparently resisted the expansion of Christian -\nity in Gojjam. Me`at Gone was another king of Gojjam during the reign of King Dawit (r. 1380-1 412). In the 15\nth century, Gojjam was one of the important provinces where royal \ngovernors were appointed as rulers. In the course of the 1 4th and 15th centuries, the east -\nern parts of Gojjam were inhabited by the Amhara of Shewa and the medieval province of Amhara. Much of Gojjam, especially its eastern territories, were fiefs of the famous Queen Elleni, who is said to have rebuilt the monastery of Mertole Mariyam. \n7 .3.2. Polities of Bizamo, Wajj and Ganz\nThe state of Bizamo existed on the southern bend of the Abay River just opposite the pres -\nent district of Wemberma in southern Gojjam. We do not have evidence about the time in which the state of Bizamo emerged. It was inhabited by Omotic language speakers like the Shinasha. Between the 1 4\nth and 16th centuries, Bizamo was a tributary to the Christian high-\nland Kingdom. On the arrival of the Macha Oromo towards the end of the 16th century, part \nof the population of Bizamo fled across the Abay River into Gojjam. Part of the population remained behind and retreated further west to the lowlands, while the remaining part was assimilated by the Macha Oromo. \nOn the other hand, the polity of Wajj was situated around Lake Ziway, in the area west \nof Fatagar and east of Hadya. We do not have evidence about the ethnic identity and the emergence of Wajj as a state. Like other states around it, Wajj was reduced to tributary sta -\ntus first by King Amde Tsiyon. In the 15\nth century, the rulers of Wajj used the title of Qats, \nwhich was a Muslim title. Wajj was an important center of military activity by the kings of the Christian highland kingdom during the post-Imam Ahmad period. The region was occupied by the Oromo in the last quarter of the 16\nth century. \nFinally, Ganz was probably situated in the Rift Valley area between Wajj to the east, Kambata to the west and Hadya to the south.

The Kingdom of Ennarya\nThe medieval kingdom of Ennarya was situated immediately to the north of the Gojeb River and west of the upper course of the Gibe River. Very little evidence is available about Ennarya`s early history. It was under the influence of the Christian highland state beginning in about the middle of the 13\nth century. Eventually, Ennarya was reduced to tributary status \nby King Amde Tsiyon. Ennarya was the main source of trade items for the region`s long \ndistance trade up to the 16th century. Among others, pure gold from Ennarya was exported \nto countries as far as Egypt, Greece and Rome. Beginning from the end of the 16th century, \nEnnarya strongly resisted the Macha Oromo for over a century. Finally, it was defeated by \nthe Limmu Oromo, who was one of the sub groups of the Macha Oromo confederacy. \nSince then, the name of the kingdom was changed to Limmu–Ennarya. \nNB: The Kingdom of Damot also belonged to this group of states.

How -\never, with the arrival of the Macha Oromo to the region south of the Abay River in the late 16\nth century, many of them were forced to settle in new areas. The Shekka and Anfillo were \npushed further west to their present environment in southwestern Ethiopia. Besides, w hen \nthe kingdom of Bizamo was overrun by the Macha Oromo, the Shinasha moved across the Abay and settled in southern Gojjam and Metekel. \nMost of the Gonga peoples established elaborate state systems of their own.

In the last decades of the 15\nth century, Emir Mahfuz emerged as the powerful ruler of Adal and Zeyla. He \nstrengthened the sultanate of Adal and began a series of attacks on the Christian highland Kingdom, particularly during the reigns of Eskindir (r. 1 478-94) and Na`od (1 494-1508).

He is popularly known in the Christian highlands as Gragn (the left-handed). There is lack of clear evidence about his family background. According to his chronicle, the Futuh al-Habesha, Ahmad belonged to a clan called Balaw in Hubat, located near present day Babile. He was a cavalry officer under Mahfuz and married his daughter, Bati Dil Wambara. \nAhmad combined energetic and tactful leadership qualities. First, he systematically got rid \nof his internal rivals one after the other, and became the Imam of Adal. Then, he tried to consolidate his power in the lowlands by reconciling the warring Afar, Somali and Harari communities. The Afar had already started to make incursions into the agricultural areas in the highlands since the time before the rise of Mahfuz. The Somali and other pastoral communities, with their cattle, also began to move into the relatively fertile highland areas of Adal. This population movement created violence among the Harari, Afar and Somali communities as they fought each other frequently. It was under these circumstances that Ahmad played the role of arbitrator and restorer of peace in the lowlands. He persuaded the fighting groups to abandon their differences and launch a war against the Christian Highland Kingdom. The restoration of peace in the region enabled Ahmad to recruit a large number of soldiers into his army from among the people. \nHowever, it should be clear that the war Imam Ahmad launched against the Christian high -\nland kingdom was not a war over religious issues. Rather, it was the last stage of the earlier \nconflicts between the Walasma Sultans and the kings of the Christian highland kingdom over the control of Zeyla trade and the lands through which the trade routes passed. Be -\nsides, Adal and other Sultanates wanted to regain their independence from the Christian highland kingdom and create Islamic empire of their own. \nImam Ahmad began his campaign in 1527 by attacking the forces of the Christian kingdom \nstationed in the tributary provinces of Dawaro, Fatagar and Bali, after which he returned to Adal with large booties. On the other hand, King Libne Dingil, who had never expected a serious Muslim threat since the death of Mahfuz in 15 17 , ordered the Christian governor of Bali named Degelhan to subdue Adal. But Degelhan was defeated by the Imam`s forces in Adal. Since then, Ahmad has carried out a series of expeditions to the highlands of the provinces west of Adal with no strong resistance from Imperial forces. With this, Ahmad`s confidence greatly increased and he prepared himself for a conventional war against the Christian highland kingdom."

This was a big land mark in the history of the relationship between Adal and the Christian highland kingdom. Ahmad`s army was much smaller than Libine Dingil`s army. but it was better equipped and with it there were Yemeni musketeers who were sent by the Ottoman Sultan. After his victory the Imam returned to Harar to recruit more of troops. On the other hand, the Imperial army could not recover from its defeat and continuously retreated to the north. \nThe ambition of Imam Ahmad was to create an Islamic empire in the Horn of Africa.  To \nthis end, he made preparations for the total control of the Christian highland kingdom and its tributary provinces. In 153 1, he led the army of Adal and easily annexed Dawaro and Bali. Ahmad continued his all-out attack on the Christian highland kingdom, but he could not capture Libne Dingil who moved from one place to another with a small army until his death in 1540. In the years 1532 and 1533, Ahmad effectively controlled the states and peoples of southern half of the Ethiopian region. He put all these regions under the hege -\nmony of Adal from his command centers at Debre Birhan, and in Wajj and Dawaro. Wolaita was the only state in the region which successfully resisted the Imam`s army. \nAhmad launched the last phase of his campaigns from the mid-1533 to 1535 against the \nnorthern provinces of the Christian highland kingdom. He put Tigray and the areas adjoin -\ning the Red Sea under his control, and made Aksum his center. The Sultanate of Adal had supremacy over the Ethiopian region and a large part of the Horn of Africa. The territory in both the south and the north was divided into provinces which were governed by rulers appointed by the Imam. By 1535, Ahmad and his army settled in Dembiya near Lake Tana making it his new center from where he ruled the empire until he was finally defeated and killed at the battle of Woyna Dega in 1543. \nThe Involvement of the Portuguese and Ottoman Turks\nThe conflict between Adal and the Christian highland Kingdom involved the Portuguese and Ottoman Turks. By then, these two maritime powers of the world were in a state of rivalry over the dominance of the Mediterranean and Red Sea regions.  In 1520 the Por -\ntuguese mission came to the court of Libne Dingill. Jao Bermudez came to Ethiopia as a member of this mission. When the mission departed for Portugal in 1526, he remained in the country. In 1535 when Imam Ahmad was in complete control of the Ethiopian region, King Libne Dingil sent a letter to the Pope of Rome and the King of Portugal in the hands of John Bermudez, requesting their military assistance."

Libne Dingil had already died in 1540 at the monastery of Debre Damo in Tigray, and was succeeded by his son, King Gelawdewos (r. 1540-59). The Portuguese troops entered the Christian highland kingdom through Massawa and continued their march to the interior to meet the king. On their march to the south, they encountered their first engagement with the Army of Adal in eastern Tigray. But the ensuing resistance forced the Portuguese to return to the north to Dabarwa on the Red Sea coast. \nImam Ahmad intended to prevent the Portuguese soldiers from joining the Christian troops \nunder King Gelawdewos. For that end, he shifted his command center to Deresge in Semien. From this place he led his army to attack the Portuguese in Saharti. However, with the help of their cannon, the Portuguese defeated the Imam`s army. The Imam himself was wounded and slightly escaped capture. Ahmad`s army was defeated in another engagement two weeks later. Then, he retreated further south to the area southeast of Lake Ashange.  The Portuguese also moved to the area south of the lake and awaited the coming of Gelawdewos. \nIn the meantime, the Imam turned to the Ottoman Turks for military assistance. The Ottomans \nresponded immediately by sending 900 troops armed with muskets and cannons. With this, Ahmad quickly marched to Wefla. In the battle that followed, the Portuguese suffered a crush -\ning defeat. Their commander, Christopher da Gama, was wounded, captured and killed. The remnants of the Portuguese retreated to the northwest of the country and met with Gelawde -\nwos towards the end of 1542. \nMeanwhile, Imam Ahamad committed a grave mistake by sending most of the Ottoman mus -\nketeers back to their home country. The rest of his army was also overstretched throughout \nthe vast empire. On the other hand, the Portuguese were furious about the death of their com-mander and sought to avenge it. The presence of the Portuguese musketeers amongst them boosted the morale of Gelawdewos`s army. In February 1543 Gelawdewos led the combined forces of Ethiopians and Portuguese and defeated the Imam`s army at the battle of Woyna Dega in Dembiya. Ahmad was shot by a Portuguese musketeer and died soon after. The Mus -\nlim army and the Imam`s wife, Bati Del Wambara, retreated south to Adal. The brief period of supremacy of Adal over the Ethiopian region and the Horn of Africa came to an end. \nThe conflict between the Christian highland kingdom and the Sultanate of Adal continued until 1559 when the army of Adal led by Emir Nur al-Wazir defeated the army of the Christian highland kingdom led by king Gelawdewos (r. 1540-59).

In the first place, the con -\nflicts caused huge material destruction, and the loss of human lives. Many churches and monasteries throughout the Christian highland kingdom were looted and burned to the ground. Invaluable religious documents and relics stored in these institutions were turned to ash.  Besides, the series of conflicts caused a severe reduction of population in both the highlands and lowlands because a large number of people lost their lives. Above all, the war weakened the power of the Christian highland kingdom. Imperial armies built over the preceding centuries were destroyed. Those armies stationed in tributary provinces were dismantled. This opened the way for the rivalry between the monarchy and the regional no-bility. Subsequently, regional lords began to challenge the authority of the kings. As a result, the Christian highland kingdom failed to regain its lost power and authority. \nThe military conflict was partly the cause of population movements in the region. Many \npeople were forced to change their settlement areas to avoid the conflicts. The movement of people from one area to another led to the intermixing of different ethnic and religious groups. For instance, Muslim lowlanders permanently settled in the highlands. This seems to have improved the ethnic and religious differences in the region. The military conflict disrupted the Zeyla trade. The trade routes became more and more unsafe for caravan mer-chants because of the chaotic situation caused by the military conflicts.

The Movement of the Somali, Afar and Argoba Peoples\nPopulation movements were common in the Ethiopian region during the period between the 1 4\nth and 16th centuries. The Somali, Afar, and Argoba population movements occurred \npartly as a result of the conflicts between the Sultanates and the Christian highland king -\ndom, and partly because of natural factors such as draught and famine. Repeated conflicts \nbetween the two sides obviously forced these peoples to change their settlement areas.\n1. The Somali \nPrior to the 16th century, Somali sub-groups moved into the interior of the Horn of Africa \nfrom the coastal areas of Zeyla, Berbera, Benadir and Mogadishu. Subsequently, they occu -\npied their present day territory both in Ethiopia and Somalia. During the wars between the \nSultanate of Adal led by Imam Ahmed and the Christian highland kingdom under King Libne Dingil (r. 1508-40), the Somali formed significant part of the army of Adal. In the course of the war, pastoral sections of the Somali also moved to the eastern highlands in search of water and pasture. \n2. Afar\nHistorical sources show that the Afar people have lived in north eastern Ethiopia, Djibouti and south eastern Eritrea since ancient times. Before the 16th century, due to drought and"

Like the Somali, territories inhabited by \nthe Afar were within the zone of conflict between the Sultanates and the Christian highland kingdom. During the conflict, due to their pastoral economy, the Afar obviously moved to relatively safer areas.  This helped them to survive the destructive effects of the conflict.  \nThe Afar were under the influence of the Sultanate of Ifat, and then of Adal. Like the Somali, \nduring the period of Imam Ahmed, they fought the wars on the side of the Imam, and Afar pastoral groups moved into the highlands of the Ethiopian region. \n3. The Argoba \nThe Argoba are one of the ancient inhabitants of the Ethiopian region who accepted Islam in an earlier time through religious leaders who came from Arabia. Linguists classify their language in the Ethio-Semitic language family. During the medieval period, the Argoba were agents of trade, Islamic expansion and Muslim state formations in the Horn. They had con-nections with Ifat, Walasma, Harar, and Hadya. \nMainly due to their location on the caravan trade routes and areas of conflict between the \nChristian highland kingdom and the Sultanates of the lowlands, the Argobas were perhaps most affected by the conflicts.  Trade and war may have been the main factors for their spread in the region between Southern Wollo and Harar. Today, in addition to the Argoba Zone in the Afar Regional State, there are some villages of the Argoba in Southern Wollo, Northern Shewa in Amhara, and Hararge in Oromia Regional States respectively. \n7 .5.2. The Oromo Population Movement\nThe Oromo are one of the ancient peoples of the Ethiopian region and the Horn of Africa. Linguistically, Afan Oromo belongs to the East Lowland Cushitic language family which consists of the Somali, Afar, Gedeo, Kambata, and so on. Available evidences show that the 16\nth century large scale Oromo population movement began from the Bale highlands. \nCauses of the Movement\nAt the time, the major part of the Oromo population lived in the highlands of Bale and practiced mixed farming. An increase in the number of cattle populations in the highlands of Bale began in the 1 4th century, resulting in a shortage of pasture land. The lowlands in the immediate south and southwest of the Bale highlands provided an excellent pasture, where young men took their cattle for grazing. Young men moved with their cattle to the"

In the course of time, these \nyoung men evolved into separate Oromo sub-groups with a predominantly pastoral eco -\nnomic life. Also, sedentary Oromo groups had already existed in the Sultanates of Sharka and Dawaro before the 16\nth century.\nWhen Imam Ahmad began his early campaigns in the 1520s, the southern frontier of the Christian highland kingdom was open to the northward movement of groups of Oromo. The movement of the Oromo rapidly increased during the period after the defeat and death of Imam Ahmad. As a result, between the 1550s and 1580s, the Oromo rapidly moved into the central, southeastern, western, southern, and some parts northern Ethiopian regions. \nDirections and Stages of the Movement\nOn the eve of their 16th century large scale movement, the Oromo were organized into two separate \nconfederacies called Borana and Barantu. The Borana confederacy consisted of various sub-groups of the Macha, Tulama, Guji and Southern Borana Oromo. The Barantu also consisted mainly of Karayu, Ittu, Marawa, Akkachu, Arsi, and Humbana.    \nIn the course of their movement and expansion, the Borana moved in the direction of the central \nand southwestern Ethiopian regions. Oromo groups belonging to the Borana branch also moved to the highlands of northern Kenya. On the other hand, the Barantu Oromo followed a north easterly direction and ultimately reached the Awash Valley, Harar, Wollo and other adjacent areas. \nThe 16\nth century movement of the Oromo into the highlands was first initiated by the Macha and \nTulama branches of the Borana Oromo in about 1522. They took a northward direction and passed \nthrough the area between Lake Abaya and Mount Walabu, and then headed in the direction of the Rift Valley Lakes region. In the course of their movement, the Oromo launched swift attacks on the states of Hadya, Bali, Sharkha, Dawaro and Fatagar. At this time, the army of the Christian highland kingdom under king Gelawdewos (r. 1540-59) operated in the area of Lake Ziway. But it failed to check the rapid advance of the Oromo who controlled the territories of these Muslim states in the 1550s.\nAt the beginning of the 1560s, the Macha and Tulama established their new center at Odaa Nabee, near Dukam, where the two held a common Chafee (assembly). From this center, they conducted periodic attacks on the old states of Wajj, Bizamo, Damot and Gafat. In so doing, they were encountered by the army under King Sertse Dingil (r. 1563-97) who scored a victory over them in 1572 in the land of the Maya around Wajj. But Sertse Dingil`s temporary success did not save these states from being over run by the Oromo. As a result, part of the population of Bizamo and Damot fled across the Abay River to settle in Gojjam."

The \nOromo began to attack this kingdom at the beginning of the 17th century, but resistance con -\ntinued throughout the century. Consequently, the Limmu branch of the Macha Oromo defeated Ennarya in about 17 10, and since then, the territory was renamed Limmu-Ennarya. South of the Gojeb River, another medieval kingdom of Kafa successfully repelled the attack of the Oromo, and curbed their movement to the south of the river. \nOn the other hand, the movement of Barantu Oromo followed a north easterly direction. The \nArsi moved from the highlands of Bale into the Lake Ziway area and settled in their present territory of the same name. In addition, the Karayu left the upper course of the Wabi Shabale River and moved eastwards to their present territory in the eastern lowland. The Ittu, Humbana (Anniya and Afran Qallo) and other eastern Oromo branches moved to their present territory of Hararghe. The Guji also moved to the south and settled in their present territory. \nConsequences of the Movement\nThe centuries long population movement of the Oromo had a number of consequences which equally affected both the Oromo and the other states and societies of the period. To begin with, the movement brought the various branches of the Oromo into contact with the various other peoples of the Ethiopian region. \nThe medieval kingdoms and sultanates of the region were the first to be affected by the popu -\nlation movement. The Christian kingdom was restricted to the regions north of the Abay River. \nSimilarly, in the east, the Sultanate of Adal was reduced to the city of Harar surrounded by the Jugol wall. In the southern and south western parts of the Ethiopian region, the states of Bali, Hadya, Fatagar, Dawaro, Damot, Gafat and Bizamo were either destroyed or highly influenced by the Oromo. \nThe communities who accepted the Oromo were treated kindly. Their property would not be \nlooted. Instead, they were adopted as members of a particular Oromo sub-group through the institution of Moggassa and enjoyed every right adoption entailed. On the contrary, those who resisted were harshly treated, their property was plundered and parts of their populations were forced to flee from their ancestral territories. The good examples in this case were the peoples in the states of Damot and Bizamo.  \nThe movement eventually resulted in the exchange of socio-cultural values and institutions \nbetween the Oromo and the people with whom they came into contact. Several non-Oromo ethnic groups adopted the Gadaa system. The Oromo also took various socio-cultural \nele-"

Others adopted the religion of Islam particularly in the eastern part of the Ethiopian region. \nThe movement of the Oromo into very wide areas of the Ethiopian region weakened their \nindigenous political system. The Gadaa system functioned well in a geographically limited territory. In this condition, it was impossible for the different branches of the Oromo to live under one Gadaa assembly. Different centers of assembly sprang up in different areas. Environmental differences also brought about slight differences in the naming of Gadaa grades. \nNevertheless, though the Oromo established various Gadaa centres, they have been \ngoverned by the same Gada values due to the existence of the Gadaa federation system \nwhich has been strengthened for a century by Muda ceremonies .  \nFinally, changes in the economic life of the Oromo also affected the Gadaa system. In the territories where they settled, the Oromo adopted a sedentary mixed farming economy that led to the formation of social classes. They were also involved in long distance trade. During the first half of the 19\nth century, acute competition and constant wars over the control of \ntrade and trade routes led to the rise of powerful warlords who began to challenge the authority of Gadaa officials. The wealth from agriculture and trade enabled some Abbaa Duulaa to build their own private armies for further control of land, markets and trade routes. They imposed their authority on their own sub-groups and then on others. Step by step, the power of Gadaa declined to control the ambitious Oromo war leaders who stayed in power longer than what was set in the Gadaa cycle and eventually became Mootii (king). \nThe Gadaa System of the Oromo\nThe Gadaa system is an indigenous democratic socio-political institution of the Oromo. In the past, the system regulated the entire political, economic, social and religious life of the Oromo. The Gadaa system was inscribed by UNESCO in 2016 as an intangible World Cultural Heritage of humanity at its 1 1\nth intangible world heritage .\nUnder the Gadaa system newly born generations of Oromo children are expected to pass through a series of Gadaa grades that succeded each other every eight years in assuming military, economic, political and ritual responsibilities. Each member of the Gadaa grade performed in different capacities \nto the society as a whole."

The first forty years were the Gadaa of the father, and had particular names. The second forty years were the Gadaa of the son, and also had their own names. The newly born infant boy always enters the system of grades exactly forty years (five Gadaa grades) behind the father regardless of the age of the father. The move-ment of forty years was cyclical, repeating itself after every eighty years. \nThe Gadaa government called Chaffee (Assembly) was also set up by officials elected from \namong the members of the Gadaa. The Chaffee functioned at local, regional and central levels based on democratic principles. Gadaa officials were elected on the basis of their ability. The qualifications for election include oratory, knowledge of history and traditions of the society, past military achievements with recognizable potential for future leadership. The highest authority in the Gadaa government was vested in the Abbaa Bokku or Abbaa Gadaa (father of the Gadaa or spokesperson). The Abbaa Gadaa was just first among equals. There were various other officials, including Abbaa Sera (the chief judge) and Abbaa Duulaa (commander of the army). In addition, a council of retired Gadaa officials assisted the Abbaa Bokku in running the government. \nThe elected Gadaa officials ruled the Oromo in accordance with the laws of the Gadaa \nsystem for eight years. The government’s independent executive, legislative and judicial branches were a way of balancing power. Corrupt or dictatorial leaders would be removed from power through a process called “buqqisu” (removal) before the official end of their term. \nOromos women`s participation in the Gadaa system is realized by a parallel institution \nknown as Siinqee.

Haadha Siinqee (mother of Siinqee) is one of the members of the Gadaa, and participates in the peace making pro -\ncesses along with the legal experts and elders. \nThe Gadaa system functioned among the Oromo for many centuries even after their move -\nment and expansion throughout the Ethiopian region since the early decades of the 16\nth \ncentury. However, the system lost many of its traditional elements over time, and eventually \ndeclined. Several internal and external factors contributed to the decline of the Gadaa system. These were the emergence of powerful Abbaa Duulas (war leaders) who gradually became Mootii (king), involvement of the Oromo in long distance trade, the expansion of Islam among the Oromo, interactions with the monarchical Omotic states, and, later on, missionary activities and the influence of the hierarchical system of the Ethiopian Empire state.\nConsequently, the Gadaa system became reduced to ritual and ceremonial activities as it \nis practiced by part of the Oromo. However, some Gadaa expressions and psychological traits remain intact in current Oromo socio-cultural life. The Gadaa system is a model that shows the ways in which societies in the past tried to govern themselves democratically. The system set limits on Gadaa rulers and guaranteed the rights to be enjoyed by all members of Oromo society. The democratic nature of the system preserved the unity of the Oromo and sustained its internal peace for centuries back. \nMoggassa and Guddifacha\nMoggassa and Guddifacha were the institutions practiced by the Oromo during their cen-\nturies of movement and expansion. Moggassa means adopting a new Oromo or non-Oro -\nmo sub-group or any other social group as a body (in mass) by a ceremony of oath held in the presence of the Abbaa Gadaa. Based on this institution various Oromo sub-groups ad-opted quite a number of people. Adopted Oromo sub-groups or any other group became collectively Ilma Gossa (sons of the sub-group) and were entitled to all the socio-economic and political rights adoption entailed. \nThe Oromo’s adoption of a growing number of groups of people expanded their numbers \nand, as a result, their military potential to battle the enemy.

The \nwar and peaceful interactions among several of them mainly revolved around the need to monopolize the Zeyla trade. The Zeyla trade created a sense of economic interdependence among the various states and peoples of the Ethiopian region. Along with trade items they exchanged social and cultural values. At the same time, the competition for control of trade led to prolonged wars between the states of the region. For a time, most of the states of the region were reduced to the status of tribute paying provinces of the Christian highland kingdom, where powerful Kings stationed military garrisons. This condition continued until the last quarter of the 15\nth century. \nThe 16th century was known in Ethiopian history for two great events, such as the wars \nbetween the Sultanate of Adal and the Christian highland kingdom, and the Oromo popu -\nlation movement.

The kingdom existed between the Gibe and the \nupper course of the Omo Rivers or to the north east of the kingdom of Kafa.

Trade and handicrafts (weaving and iron work) played a secondary role in the \neconomy of the Yem people.  \nThe Kingdom of Kafa\nThe medieval kingdom of Kafa was located south of the Gojeb River. The time when the kingdom came into existence is not clearly known. There is evidence about the rise to prominence of the Kingdom of Kafa in the 1 4\nth century. The people of Kafa call themselves \nKafecho. They claim that they have descended from a royal clan called Minjo. The Minjo dynasty has ruled the kingdom since about 1390. The crown of Kafa was hereditary in the Minjo clan. The kings of Kafa had crown names and used a title called Tato. \nThe kingdom was divided into provinces which were ruled by provincial governors. The \ncentral government was headed by the Tato (king) who had absolute power in the kingdom. He was assisted by a Council of Seven called Mikkerecho. The members of the council were nominated from among the influential clans of the kingdom, and it had a very strong power in the state system of Kafa. Bonga was the capital of the kingdom. The Kingdom is known for its natural and human made defense systems. The northern frontier of the kingdom was defended by the Gojeb River. All along the territories of the kingdom, watch towers were secretly erected at high points to watch and detect the approach of the enemy. The king -\ndom also had an old tradition of digging trenches along its frontiers for defensive purposes. One of the notable defense trenches is called ‘Hiriyoo’ or defense ditch. In times of war, the warriors formed the nucleus of an army, which was joined by all able-bodied men of the kingdom. \nKafa was a very resourceful kingdom. Its dense forests and land in general were properties \nof the king. The kingdom’s economy was based on agriculture and supplemented by trade. The people paid tax in cattle and musk which was collected by assigned tax collectors called Tate Kisho (the hands of the king). Trade was another source of income for the kings of Kafa. The major trade items from Kafa were ivory, cattle, musk, slaves, and later on, coffee as well. Merchants paid taxes and custom dues at the gates of the kingdom. \nWith such a strong political organ, defense and economy, Kafa existed as an independent \nstate for a long period of time. It successfully resisted the Oromo expansion during the 17\nth \nand 18th centuries. In the 19th century, Kafa`s powerful kings extended the territories of the \nkingdom to the south, south west and northeast directions.

After the heavy war with Menilek II’s army headed by Ras Wolde Giyorgis, the last king of Kafa, Tato Gakki Sharecho, was captured and taken to Addis Ababa and led his exile life until his death. In the end, the kingdom was incorporated into the Ethiopian Empire in 1897 .\nThe Kingdom of Shekka\nThis kingdom existed to the west of Kafa kingdom and east of the Baro River. Two dynasties ruled over Shekka. The Batto dynasty ruled the kingdom until the end of the 16th century, when the Bushasho dynasty took over. The first Bushasho kings traced their origins to the neighbouring Kingdom of Anfillo. The kings of Shekka, like Kafa, had crown names and used the royal title of Tato. The territory was divided into six provinces whose governors were also councilors of the Tato. Christianity is believed to have been introduced to Shek -\nka from the north in the late 16\nth century by King Sertse Dingil (r. 1563-97). Shekka was \nfrequently at war with the expanding Macha Oromo until the late 19thcentury, to whom \nthey lost many territories. The kingdom also had close economic, political, and historical \nrelationshipswith the kingdoms of Ennarya, Kafa and Anfillo. Gecha in Anderacha was the capital of the kingdom in most of its history. \nAccording to tradition, during the 19\nth century, the Kingdom of Shekka was ruled by five \nTato (kings). They were Bedi Nechochi (r. 1800-05), Techi Nechochi (r. 1805-20), Geli \nGawochi (r. 1820-50), Deji Gawochi (r. 1850-87) and Techi Gawochi (r. 1887-1898). \nThe Kingdom of Wolaita\nThe medieval Omotic Kingdom of Wolaita existed south of the Sultanate of Hadya. The \nkingdom had strong historical connections with the medieval kingdom of Damot. Beginning in the early years of the 1 4\nth century, Wolaita was first ruled by the Wolaita Malla dynasty. \nMotalami, who was initially king of the kingdom of Damot, was the founder of this dynasty. Wolaita became a tributary of the Christian highland kingdom during the reign of Amde Tsiyon (r. 13 1 4-44) and paid tributes in horses to Yeshak (r.1 412-30).\nThe Wolaita Malla dynasty was replaced by the Tigre dynasty in the 15\nth century. The new \ndynasty extended its influence to the neighbouring peoples like Gamo, Kucha, Boroda, and \nDawuro. Dry stone defensive walls were erected along the borderlines of the kingdom. They 8.1.1.2.

The kingdom successfully \nresisted both the forces of Imam Ahmad and the Oromo population movement.\nThe kings of Wolaita used the royal title of Kawo. The king had absolute power over the \nlives and property of his people. The kingdom also had a warrior class called ‘Goqa”. Agri -\nculture was the basis of the economy of Wolaita. All land in the kingdom was considered the property of the Kawo (king). Trade and handicrafts were auxiliary economic activities in the kingdom.\nIn the early 19\nth century, the center of the kingdom was transferred from Didaye hill in \nKoysha Lasho in the northwest to Damota hill near present day Wolaita Sodo town. The \nKingdom was very strong particularly during the reign of Kawo Gobe (r. 1848-88). He was succeeded by his grand son namely Kawo Tona Gaga (r. 1888-1894), who was a deter-minant warrior and the last king of Wolaita before it was incorporated into the Ethiopian Empire in 1894.\nThe Kingdom of Dawuro \nDawuro lived along the Omo river basin since early times. The territory of their kingdom \nwas bordered in the north, east and south by the Gojeb and Omo rivers; and in the west by the highlands of Kafa. One of their multiple traditions traces the origins of the Dawuro to the medieval Sultanate of Dawaro. By 1700, the Kawuka dynasty created a big state by uniting a great number of petty chieftains of the territory. From among the Dawuro Kati (kings), Kati Irashu and Kati Halala were famous. According to Dawuro tradition, Kati Halala was the grandson of the King of Kafa. During his reign, Dawuro incorporated Konta. \nSince the 16\nth century, the Dawuro have erected a series of borderline dry-stone defensive \nwalls, the last of which was erected by Kati Halala during the second half of the 18th century. \nBecause of this, the defensive walls of Dawuro are traditionally called Kati Halala Kalla (the \nwalls of Kati Halala). \nThe Kingdoms of Gamo and Gofa\nThe Kingdom of Gamo:-  the Gamo inhabited the area between Lake Chamo and Abaya \nin the north and the Gughe mountain and beyond in the south. According to tradition, the \nname Gamo means “lion”. In the highland areas enset was the staple food, and additionally, cereals such as barely, wheat, teff, peas, beans and cabbage were produced. In the lowlands, the Gamo cultivated food crops such as maize and sweet potatoes. The scattered settle -"

The Darie also had its own place of assembly to discuss communal issues and resolve disputes. Nomination to be a member of the assembly was carried out through election and genealogical seniority. \nThe kingdom of Gofa:- the Gofa people inhabited the region bordered by the Omo River in \nthe west, and the kingdoms of Dawuro and Gamo in the east.  Agriculture (animal rearing \nand crop cultivation) was the base of the economy of the Gofa people. Iron bars served as the main local currency of the kingdom. Gofa was an independent kingdom with sacred kings whose royal court was in Lote. The system of administration of the kingdom had dual structure consisting of a “landed chief” (kawo or Kati) in the highlands and a “rain king” (ira-kati) in the lowlands responsible for rainfall. The Kawo or Kati (king) had a number of advisers and administrators below him. The Gofa had an intricate customary legal system known as Woga. \nSince the mid-17\nth century, the Gofa kingdom expanded south wards from its core area \ncalled Wurki near the Omo River. The biggest expansion of the kingdom was carried out in \nthe late 18th century during the reigns of Gamo and Ole.  The last king of the Gofa, kawo \nKamma, lost his life in 189 1 while fighting aginst the imperial army of Ethiopia. \nOther Omotic peoples including the Zayse, Basketo, Oyda, Kara, Malle, and Kore had more \nor less similar socio-economic and political structures based on the Kati or kawo system of governance. \nActivity 8.1 \n1.

The Sera and \nWoma institutions had various roles in resolving conflicts over property, marriage and homi -\ncide at village level. \nSidama: - Woma (village level governance) was the cultural and ritual leadership in Sidama \nsociety. Members were selected on the basis of their ability to bring peace, wisdom and cau -\ntion. “Sera” (social constitution) is the customary law of the Woma. \nIn order to enforce the Sera, the Sidama was also divided into generation-sets called Luwa \ninstitution. It is an age grade system where each grade rotates every 8 y ears. The number \nof years of rotation varies from one Sidama sub group to another. The rotation of grades \ntakes place on the day of Fiche Chamballalla (New Year), which has been registered as In -\ntangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2015. The Luwa indigenous form of \ngovernance has much resemblance with the Oromo Gadaa system. In the Luwa institution, there are five rotating grades. These are sequentially Wawassa, Darara, Mogissa, Hirbora, and Fullassa. A male member belongs to certain Luwa at birth. The son becomes a member of the Luwa following Luwa group of his father. Therefore, these sequences show a father-son relationship, i.e., Wawassa is father of Darara; Darara is the father of Mogissa and the like. \nKambata: -  The indigenous governing institution of the Kambata people is called Sera. It served \nas a basis for political administration, social interaction, and means of conflict resolution within the territory of Kambata. Relations between individuals, clans and territorial units are regulated by the Sera. Administrative and judiciary duties were also carried out at the higher level by a council called Hambarcho. The council had seven members representing the seven clans of the \nKambata people. \n Compare and contrast the Oromo Gadaa system with the Sidama or other`s indigenous \ngovernance systems?\nLuwa officials such as “Gadanna” (leader) and “Jalawa” (assistant) stayed in power for eight \nyears. Societal recognition is an important criterion for being elected as a Chimesa (pl. Chimey -\nye), which meansa leader with authority. These elderly officials had the authority to enforce the “Sera” (constitution) of the Sidama nation. In the past, the Luwa institution had two important objectives. They were recruiting and five months of military training of capable Sidama for the nation`s defense, and the nomination of potential candidates for Gadanna and Jalawa elections.  Despite the fact that the Sidama society has its own customs of honoring elderly women, they were prohibited from becoming respected elders with authority and responsibility for the na -\ntion’s defense."

They also share a very close language with Sidama. The major economic activity of the Gedeo was the cultivation of enset.  In the past, the Gedeo had an indigenous administrative system known as ballee (council of elders) that worked with the age classes and ranking. The ballee had seven grades with a ten years period each creating a 70-year cycle. It provided the members of the Gedeo society with secular and ritual leadership. The promotion to the next age set and the transfer of power of the Abba Gadaa of the Gedeo was carried out through a ceremony.  \n \nThe Konso people are one of the Cushitic language speakers in the southwest. Their language is called Affa Konso (Konso language). Agriculture was the major economic activity of the Konso. The Konso had a peculiar culture of soil conservation techniques notably the construction of terraces, wooden carvings and stone enclosures. \nUntil the late 19\nth century, there was no central authority among the Konso. Each village (sub \ngroup) was ruled by a council of elders called Hayyota who were selected through direct par -\nticipation of male members of the village.

The representatives of the sub groups of Sabat Bet and Kestane Gurage assembled at a common place of assembly to agree on the fundamental rules governing their communities.

The major factors that accounted for this transformation were the revival of long-distance trade and the spread of Islam into the region that have significantly declined the power of Gadaa government. In addition, the rise of powerful Abbaa Duulaa (war leaders) endangered the Gadaa system. With sufficient wealth from extensive agriculture, tribute, taxation, trade, and booty successful military leaders were able to maintain permanent military forces with which they made themselves Mootii (kings). The combination of the above factors was responsible for the decline of the Gadaa system and rise of the monarchal form of governments in the Gibe region. \nFive Oromo monarchical states ruled by their own Mootii (king) emerged around the Gibe \nRiver. They were Limmu-Enarya, Jimma-kakka, Gera, Gomma, and Gumma. They are some -\ntimes called the “Gibe Monarchies”. The Gibe states were located along the trade routes of which accounted for their rise and prosperity. The most important trade items originated from these states include ivory, musk, spices, precious skins, slaves, gold and coffee. Trade was conducted with the neighbouring Omotic states as well as long-distance traders from northern Ethiopian region.\nThe earliest of the Gibe states was Limu-Ennarya which was built around 1800 on the \nmedieval Omotic kingdom of Ennarya by the Limmu branch of the Macha Oromo. Its first king was Bofo or Abba Gomol I (r. 1800-1825) renamed after his war horse. Its capital was Saqqa. Limmu-Ennarya became powerful because of its control over long distance trade routes of the region. It reached the height of its power during the reign of Ibsa or Abba Bagibo (r.1825-1861).\nGumma was the second state to be formed in the Gibe region. The famous warrior, Oncho \nJilcha (r. 1810-30), completed the process of state formation in Gumma around 1810. Un -\nder him, Gumma was at wars with its neighbours particularly with Limmu-Ennarya. Similarly, Abba Manno (r. 1820-40) completed the earlier process of state formation of Gomma. Gomma was the earliest of the Gibe states to be Islamized by the 1830s. Islam served to him as an ideological justification to strengthen Abba Manno`s dynasty in place of the Gadaa system.\nJimma-Kakka was the other Gibe state which was established about 1830 by the famous \nwarrior named Sanna. He was the son of a famous Abbaa Duula named Abba Maggal. A skillful warrior and diplomat, Sanna, controlled trade and trade routes and made Jimma a powerful kingdom.

By the middle of the 19th century, Jimma-Kakka became the \nstrongest rival of Limmu-Enarya. Its capital was Hirmata. The kingdom came to be popularly identified as Jimma-Abba Jiffar. \nFinally, the state of Gera was founded by a famous warrior named Tullu Gunji about the \nmiddle of the 1830s. Tullu was a popular king, and fought against the states of Kafa, Gom -\nma and Gumma. After his death, Abba Baso became the king of Gera. He ruled Gera until about 1838 when he was overthrown and exiled to Jimma by his brother, Abba Rago. \nThe Leeqaa States\nIn the present day Wallaga, east of the Didessa River, the Leeqaa group of the Macha Oromo \nunderwent a similar socio-economic and political transformation. There were several Leeqaa Oromo groups. The two main groups - Leeqaa Naqamtee and Leeqaa Qellam - formed their own polities of the same name about the mid-19\nth century. Here, like the Gibe region, the \nauthority of Gadaa officials was increasingly challenged by powerful Abbaa Dulaa.One of these Abbaa Duulaa was Bakaree Godana. He unified a number of Leeqaa families around Naqamtee and established an agriculturally resourceful polity. His base was at Wacha (the nucleus of Naqamtee). His son and successor, Moroda Bakaree (r. 1868-89), extended his family`s influence and power over the Leeqaa groups and even beyond to the Sibu group through a combination of war and diplomacy. He was succeeded by his son, Kumsa Mo -\nroda in 1889. \nSimilarly, to the south west of Leeqaa Naqamtee, Abbaa Duulaa Tulluu unified the Leeqaa \nQellam Macha Oromo groups.  Tulluu established a strong polity based on the rich agri -\ncultural resoures of the region and trans-frontier gold trade with the Sudan. Trade was also conducted with the neighbouring Sheikhdoms of Aqoldy (Assossa) and Benishangul. The dynasty was further consolidated by Tulluu`s son and successor, Dejjazmach Jootee Tulluu.\n \nThe Benishangul (Berta) and Gumuz were the two indigenous inhabitants of the Benishan-gul-Gumuz region along the Ethio-Sudan border. During the 19\nth century, the Benishangul \nestablished three important Muslim Sheikhdoms along the Ethio-Sudanese border. They were Assossa (Aqoldi), Benishangul and Khomosha. The main factors for the rise of these Sheikhdoms were the influence of Islam from the the Sudan and trans-border trade.

Fishing, gathering and hunting are their supplementary economic activities. The Nuer practiced pastoralism, which was the backbone of their economy, supplemented by crop production. Social status in the Nuer community was determined by the number of cattle owned. The Majang combine shifting cultivation with hunting and gathering. \nThe Anywaa had an indigenous administrative system whereby each village was ruled by a \nKwaari (village headman) and a Nyiye (noble). The population of each village, consisting of several hundred people was the largest political unit. Both are hereditary offices, and while village headmen are from different lineage, nobles belong to a single royal lineage.\nThe Nuer political system lacked formal authorities to compel and bring social order.

It was registered by UNESCO as World Heritage Site in 2006. In 1577 , the pressure of the advancing branches of Barantu Oromo forced the Sultans of Adal to shift the political center from Harar to Aussa in the north east of the Awash Valley. \nThe Emirs of the Harari people continued to pay annual tribute to the Sultans of Aussa until \nthe mid-17\nth century.

Many foreigners including Arabs, Persians, Turks, Armenians and the Greeks lived in the city. On the contrary, the Emirs of Harar were suspicious of Europeans. Europeans who tried to enter the city were often imprisoned or killed. It was only the British national named Richard Burton who, disguised as an Arab, was able to stay in the city for ten days in 1855. On his return to Europe, this traveler disclosed the wealth of the city and its strategic importance to the outside world.

But historical evidences show that in its early history, the Ogaden was inhabited by a now extinct people called Harla. The Harla were related to both the Harari and the Somali peoples. There are ruins of their stone built houses at several places in the Ogaden and other areas of the region. Between the 1 4\nth and 16th centuries, the Ogaden region was under the influence \nof the Sultanates of Ifat and later Adal. By the beginning of the 16th century, all the Somali \nhad already adopted Islam through Muslim merchants who settled around market places of the region. Troops conscripted from among the Somalis by Imam Ahmad, played significant roles in his fight against the Christian highland kingdom. Many of their sub-groups have also intermarried with the Oromo. 8.1.3.3. The Somali People"

Still the period was charac -\nterized by political instability in the kingdom.\nSeveral factors accounted for the interplay betwee\nn instability and attempt at consolidation \nin the kingdom throughout the second half of the 16th and early decades of the 17th century. \nTo begin with, the Oromo continued their expansion and occupied much of the area south \nof the Abay River during the period. Consequently, the Christian highland kingdom was forced to shift its political center from the Shewan highlands first to Mengiste Semayat in East Gojjam and then to Dembiya near Lake Tana during the reign of Minas (r. 1559-63). \nNB: See unit seven for the details about the Oromo population movement and the attempts \nof the rulers of the Christian highland kingdom to check their further northward advances. \nSecondly, the Ottoman Turks occupied the port of Massawa in 1557 , and established several \nposts along the Red Sea coast. They started to advance into the interior and occupied Debarwa which was the political center of the Red Sea coastal region. In 1578, the ruler of the coastal ter -\nritories, Bahire Negash Yeshaq, openly rebelled against king Sertse Dingil, and sided with the Ot -\ntoman Turks. In the next year, although the king managed to defeat Yeshaq, he could not dislodge the Ottomans from the coastal areas, which remained in their hands for the next 300 \nyears. 8.2.1.

            "text": "220Grade 1 1\nPageThe third factor of instability in the Christian highland kingdom was the rivalry between the \nmonarch and the different warlords who sought to put their own candidate on the throne. This was mainly seen soon after the coming to power of Sertse Dingil and following his death. The king`s cousin, Hamelmal, rebelled in Western Shewa at the head of a large army in the first three years of the reign of Sertse Dingil. Though Hamelmal soon became loyal to the young king, another warlord of the period by the name of Fasilo staged a rebellion in 1566 in the kingdom of Damot. At one point, Fasilo even attacked Sertse Dingil himself who narrowly escaped death. The rebellion of Fasilo continued until the beginning of 1567 when his soldiers deserted him and surrendered to the king.\nThe death of Sertse Dingil in 1597 was also followed by political disorder and bloody civil \nwars among three power contenders in the years from 1597 to 1606. They were Ya`eqob (r.1597-1603; 1604-06), Ze Dingil (r.1604), and Susinyos (r.1607-32), who assumed power one after the other. In 1607 , Susinyos, assisted by the Oromo contingent, assumed power. The Oromo supported him because he spent several years with them. Though the succes -\nsion problem was solved with his coming to power, the introduction of Catholicism brought about another period of instability in the Christian highland kingdom caused by the religious controversy between the clergies of the Orthodox Tewahido Church and the Jesuit mission -\naries.\nDespite the instabilities of the period mentioned above, the Christian highland kingdom \ntried to consolidate itself from its base in Dembiya around Lake Tana. The provinces under its control by this time were Dembiya, Gojjam, Begemdir, Lasta, Simen, and Tigray. The Lake Tana area, both in Dembiya and Gojjam, was an agriculturally fertile region. The region was important for the state to collect tributes and settled troops as local governors.  Further, trade revived in the kingdom.   Urban centers flourished along trade routes, and around palaces. There was a tendency for more static royal camps during the period. King Sertse Dingil had his capital in Emfraz where he built a palace at Guzara. \nKing Susenyos shifted his capital first to Gorgora and then Denqez west of Lake Tana, where \nhe constructed palaces. Around 1612, he also made Yibaba in Gojjam his secondary seat of power, at which he built a small palace. Jesuit missionary centers particularly Gorgora also constituted the nucleus of several towns in the region. This new stage of urbanization in the Christian highland kingdom was a prelude to the rise of Gondar as a permanent capital of the kingdom around 1636."

Why was he successful?\nAfter the end of the supremacy of Adal over much of the Ethiopian region in 1543, Portugal and the Pope of Rome wanted to convert the Ethiopian king and his people to Catholicism. Portugal allegedly claimed that, in return for military assistance, King Libne Dingil have promised in his 1535 letter to the king of Portugal to give a third of his king -\ndom and to be converted, together with his people, to Catholicism.\nSurvivors of the Portuguese troops stayed in the country. In the meantime, Jesuit mis-\nsionaries came to Ethiopia as fathers, patriarchs and bishops, their ultimate goal being to convert the people to Catholicism.  The Jesuits were members of the Society of Jesus, founded in Spain in 1540 by Saint Ignatius of Loyola as part of the Counter Reformation Movement.\nOn having understood the arrangement made in Europe for his conversion, King Gelawde -\nwos wrote a letter of objection to the Portuguese governor of India. The governor, on \nhis part, sent a young Catholic priest by the name Rodríguez to Gelawdewos so as to persuade him. Soon after his arrival, the young Jesuit priest openly criticized the Ortho -\ndox Christian practices such as circumcision, food taboos, fasting and the observance of Saturdays as heresies. However, Gelawdewos rejected the demand for his conversion and Rodriguez returned to Goa (India)."

The bishop arrived at the court of the monarch in 1557 and made repeated attempts to convert Gelawdewos.  But Oviedo failed to convince the king. Indeed, the king wrote a book called “Confessions of Gelawdewos,” in which he defended the practices of the Orthodox faith.\nAfter the death of Gelawdewos in 1559, Oviedo moved to the north and joined Bahire \nNegash Yeshaq, who had rebelled first aginst King Minas, and then Sertse Dingil. Later, he went to Goa, and died in 1597 without any success in his mission. In 1603 a new bishop named Pedro Pa`ez arrived at Massawa. But, before he reached the royal court, Ya`ekob was deposed and replaced by Ze Dingil. Ze Dingil was fully aware of the political prob-lems faced by his predecessors. Therefore, he was determined to get rid of the disloyal soldiers and their commanders, as well as the clergy, whom he thought were the sources of the weaknesses of the monarchy. When Pa`ez understood this attitude of the king, he directly told Ze Dingil that if he agreed to be converted to Catholicism, he could get Por -\ntuguese military assistance with which he could deal with his enemies, and consolidate his political power. Soon Ze Dingil began to take measures like banning the observance of Saturdays to satisfy the demands of Pa`ez.\nHowever, Pa`ez advised the king to be cautious, and not to take hasty measures that might \nlead to failure. Whatever the case, Ze Dingil had already been suspected of being secretly converted, and consequently, he faced strong opposition from the Orthodox Church, which accused him of being converted to Catholicism. In the civil war that followed, Ze Dingil was killed in 1604. In the same year, Ya’ekob was restored to power, and Pa`ez continued the same deal with him, but Ya`ekob was killed in 1607 .\nYa`ekob was succeeded by Susinyos (r.1607-32). The reign of Susinyos saw the success of \nthe long effort of the Jesuit bishops. Pa`ez was particularly successful in converting many influential dignitaries of the kingdom, including King Susinyos. Just like his immediate predecessors, Susinyos leaned towards Catholicism in order to get Portuguese military assistance. Therefore, the Jesuits got freedom to preach and recruit converts even in the court itself. The first important convert was Susinyos’s brother, Ras Si’ile Kristos, who was publicly baptized in 161 1, followed by many others.\nBeginning in 1612, a series of public debates on Catholic principles were held in the \ncourt. The debate was chaired by Susinyos himself. In the debate, the Catholics were represented by Si`ile Kristos. In the meantime, the Orthodox Church practices such as"

The Orthodox clergymen who stood against Catholicism also faced mistreatment in the court. All these measures brought about the rebellion of the peasants headed by the clergy and the nobility. In 1622, Susinyos himself was officially converted to Catholicism and made Catholicism the official state religion. A few months later, Paez died. In June 1625 Alfonso Mendez arrived to Ethiopia. \nThe first peasant rebellion against Susinyos and Catholicism broke out in 1617 , and \nfrom 1626 to 1632 Susinyos fought many battles. This was mainly because of the hasty imposition of the new religion on the peasants. Besides, many of the long established Ethiopian Christian practices were banned. For these reasons, both the peasantry and the clergy joined the rebellion to defend their religion. \nEventually, Susinyos came to understand that he could not suppress the opposition eas -\nily. In the meantime, the Portuguese soldiers and firearms which he had hoped to obtain \nfrom Portugal failed to arrive. Therefore, he realized that he had simply incurred the enmi -\nty of his people and the clergy in vain. He understood that in an attempt to build a strong and peaceful government using Catholicism, he was leading the country to a bloody civil war. So, after his last battle that took place in 1632, he decided to abandon Catholicism. In the same year, he abdicated in favour of his son, Fasiledes, whose first measure was the restoration of the Orthodox Church to its former position. In the reaction that followed, many Catholic converts were killed. The first victim was Ras Si’ile Kristos, who was publicly hanged. In 1632, Fasiledes also ordered the expulsion of the Jesuit missionaries from the country. \nThe doctrinal controversies mentioned above endangered the Orthodox Church in the \nsubsequent centuries. The religious controversy also had a long-term consequence on the foreign relations of the Christian highland kingdom. It was believed that the bloody civil war was caused by the interference of external forces. Therefore, to avoid similar problems in the future, Fasiledes made an alliance with the Muslim states on both sides of the Red Sea. He signed treaties with the Imams of Yemen and the Pashas of Swakin and Massawa, who agreed to prevent or report the coming of any European to the Christian highland kingdom. Thus, Fasiledes introduced the closed-door policy, which was to continue until the beginning of the 19\nth century. During this long period of isolation, only two Europe -\nans succeeded in reaching the Christian court at Gondar. They were the French physician named Charles Jaques Poncet (1699) and the Scottish traveler, James Bruce (17 69-7 1)."

The prosperity of Gondar mainly benefited the \nruling class, who led a luxurious life in the splendid palaces and castles. Unfortunately, \nthe prosperity and glory of Gondar did not last long. Even though it was far removed from threat, Gondar was also equally far from the center of the Christian kingdom. From the time of its foundation, the kingdom had lost control over the central and outlying territories. This paved the way for the steady growth of regionalism and the increasing independence of the great regional lords.\nGondar experienced a period of glory and splendor particularly during the reign of its \nfirst three kings. They were Fasiledes (r.1632 - 67), Yohannis I (r.1667-82) and lyasu I (r.1682-1706). Of the three, the most powerful was Iyassu I, also nick-named Iyasu the Great. He was the last powerful king who made campaigns southward across the Abay River to regain the former provinces of the kingdom. Iyasu also campaigned to Shewa, where he collected annual tribute. However, he recognized the power of the rulers of Shewa. The reign of Iyasu was also important in several other respects. During his reign, a traditional civil code, the Fitha Negest, was revised. Land laws were amended. Taxes and customs were also reorganized. The reforms promoted the development of trade through which the king strengthened his relations with Egypt.\nTowards the end of his reign, Iyasu I himself violated the closed-door policy introduced \nby King Fasiledes. As the king suffered from a skin disease, he invited the French physi-cian, Jaques Poncet, who cured him in 1699. This was followed by the visit of two Jesuits and one Franciscan missionary. The king also sent a delegation of seven young Christians to the Pope of Rome. This move, however, has aroused suspicion among the clergy. In the face of mounting opposition, Iyasu had no alternative but fled to an island in Lake Tana where he was pursued by assassins who murdered him. On his death, his son, Tekle Haymanot (r. 1607-08), took the throne.\nThe death of Iyasu I was followed by a period of political disorder resulting from power \nstruggles. Murder and assassination of the kings became common. Because of this, the kings could not stay long on the throne. They were either murdered or poisoned to death by their political rivals. This was the fate of five kings who reigned between the murder of Iyasu I, in October 1706, and the beginning of the reign of King Bekaffa (r. 1721-30) in 1721. The kings became too weak even to defend their own capital city, Gondar, which was occasionally plundered by bands of robbers and bandits."

The controversy was the legacy of a religious conflict between the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. The reign of Bekaffa was relatively more peaceful than those of his predecessors. During his reign, the kingdom enjoyed a short period of political stability. Bekaffa was admired for his efficient administration. But his reign witnessed the beginning of the autonomous development of Shewa, which continued to be ruled by an independent line of rulers for more than a century.\nBekaffa was succeeded by his young son, Iyasu II also known as “Iyasu the little” (r. \n1730-1755). He was made king under the regency of his mother, Etege Mintiwab, who came from Qwara and became another prominent woman in the politics of the Chris -\ntian Kingdom, after Queen Elleni. At the time, growing power, of the regional lords had already become a threat to the power of the Christian kings. But Mintiwab succeeded in securing the power of her son through the support she got from the lords and chiefs of Quara, who were her kinsmen. The political elite organized by Mintiwab were known as the Quaregnoch, named after their place of origin. In particular, in 1732, she brought her brother, Welde Leul, to the court of Gondar and appointed him as Rasbitweded (the equivalent of prime minister). Using his support and her kinsmen, she concentrated full power in her own hands and exercised a strong political power. \nAfter a short while, however, the influential position held by the lords and chiefs of \nQuara in the court incited strong opposition from the lords of other provinces. Iyasu II himself was tired of the growing power of his mother’s kinsmen. So, he decided to get rid of them and be replaced by allies from Oromo lords, particularly the Wollo Oromo chiefs. Iyasu’s father, Bekaffa, had earlier spent some years of exile with the Wollo Oromo chief called Amizo. Consequently, Bekaffa maintained good relations with this Oromo family, some of whom he had invited to his court. Iyasu extended his relations with the Oromos further by marrying Wabi who was baptized as Bersabeh. This event marked the active involvement of the Wollo Oromos in the politics of the Christian highland kingdom.\nIyasu II was succeeded by his son, Iyo`as (r.1755-17 69), who was born to Wabit (Bers -\nabeh). During his reign, the influence of the Oromo further increased. And the Quareg -\nnoch family, who felt dominated by the Yejju Oromos, began to challenge the rule of \nIyo`as. The growing threat to his power forced the young king to depend more and more on the support of his maternal kinsmen. Accordingly, he invited his Oromo cousins, two powerful brothers of Bersabeh by the name of Lubo and Birile who arrived in Gondar"

Oromo language became a language frequently spoken in the court of Gondar. \nAt this point, it would be interesting to provide a few lines about Etege Mintiwab. She \nwas one of the few successful women political elites in Ethiopia who exercised real power for many years. Her successes were the result of several factors. In the first place, she combined natural beauty with personal skills to manipulate political developments which were, indeed, found in good harmony in her personality. Among other things, so as to prevent the usual disorder that usually broke out following the death of a reigning monarch, she managed to keep the death of her husband, Bekaffa, a secret. In the mean -\ntime, she summoned her close relatives from Quara and gave them important posts so that revolts could be quickly suppressed.  \nSecondly, Mintiwab concluded effective political marriage alliances with the houses of \nthe most influential lords of Begemder, Gojjam, Wollo (Yejju Oromo) and Tigre. These political marriages, except the one concluded with the Yejju Oromos, further strength-ened the influence of Mintiwab. Though the marriage between Iyasu II, her son, and Wabit, an Oromo, did not initially prevent Mintiwab from achieving her objective, after the death of Iyasu II, it resulted in a long period of rivalry and war between the Quareg -\nnoch and the Yejju Oromos that claimed the lives of many people. However, for the first time in the history of Ethiopia, the Oromos were integrated into the families of the coun -\ntry’s power elites. The third factor that sustained the influence of Empress Mintiwab for such a long period of time was her concern for the society. As was the tradition before her, Mintiwab won the acceptance of the clergy and the people by constructing churches that received generous gifts and land grants as gults. Worth mentioning are Debre Tsehay Qusquam in Gondar and Narga Sellassie in Lake Tana.\nThe growing influence of the Wollo Oromo further aggravated the opposition of the \nalienated Amhara ruling elites. Mintiwab took part in the opposition against her grand -\nson. After the death of Rasbitweded Welde Leul in 17 67 , a struggle for power between the two opposing factions, namely the relatives of Mintiwab and those of Bersabeh, grew tense. Finally, to resolve the problem and to maintain her position through his help, Mintiwab invited the powerful Tigrean lord, Ras Michael Sehul, to become the guardian of the king. Ras Michael arrived in Gondar in 17 68 with large Tigrean forces and sup -\npressed the opposition brutally. Then, he made himself Rasbitweded and guardian of the reigning king, Iyo`as.

Several other kings also faced similar defeats at the hands of the expanding Oromo. \nThe establishment of the city of Gondar as a permanent capital was another factor for \nthe erosion of the traditional power and authority of the monarchy. Before its establish -\nment, the kings lived in mobile capitals and moved along with their army and retinue constantly from one district to another. In the absence of an effective administrative structure and garrisoned army, this ensured the loyalty of the regional lords. But, after the establishment of Gondar, the kings remained in the city for an indefinite period of time and neglected the provinces. In the meantime, the regional lords built up their power which threatened the traditional authority of the monarchy. Some of the powerful lords such as Welde Sillassie of Tigray and the rulers of Shewa even ignored the very existence of the highest authority and made their regional power hereditary. Such regional lords began to defy the authority of the kings who tried to assert their power. \nDuring the Zemene Mesafint, the kings at Gondar virtually lost their traditional power \nand authority. The last king, with some aspect of power was Tekle Giyorgis. But he was enthroned and dethroned six times from 1789 to 1800. Because of this, the Christian tradition has nicknamed him Fitsame Mengist (the end of the kingdom). The successors of Tekle Giyorgis became mere puppets in the hands of regional governors and warlords. The lives of the kings were secluded in the castles of Gondar and they did not have military force. Their income consisted of custom duties and fines collected from part of the city of Gondar only and the charity of some pious peoples of the city. To cite one example, in 1832, the annual income of the king at Gondar was 300 Maria Theresa Thalers (Austrian unit of currency in use at that time in Ethiopia). In contrast, in 1816, the annual income of the Tigrian lord, Ras Welde Sellassie was 75,000, while in 1840; King Sahle Sellassie of Shewa had an annual income of 85,000 Maria Theresa Thalers. \nIn short, the kings lived in poverty without any power or authority. The actual rulers \nof the Christian kingdom were regional governors, the Rases and Dejjazmaches of the various provinces. They maintained their own army and kept the tribute and revenues of their provinces. Nevertheless, even the regional lords were not secure and did not retain power for long. The decisive factors in securing regional power for long and contending"

They were the king \nmakers. Therefore, the main aim of the struggle among the leading regional lords was to secure the title of Rasbitweded. But, before assuming this position, one had to increase his domains and become powerful in order to contend for that position. Because of this, the struggle was conducted at various levels and the country turned out to be a center of civil wars. Moreover, the struggle was further aggravated by religious doctrinal disputes within the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Therefore, the Church was unable to play its traditional role of unifying diverse groups under one central government.\nSeveral regional lords were involved in the struggle for the title of Rasbitweded. But only \na few were successful. The first powerful regional lord who held this position after the death of Ras Welde Leul was Ras Micha’el Sehul of Tigray. However, after his downfall in the early 1770s, the position was totally monopolized by the Yejju Oromo who estab -\nlished the Yejju or Werre Sheh dynasty in 1786. The first Yejju Oromo lord who became Rasbitweded and founded the dynasty was Ali Gwangul, also known as Ali the Great (Ali I). After him, six members of his family held the title one after the other. Among these Yejju lords, the leading representatives of the family were Ras Gugsa and Ras Ali Alula (Ras Ali II). In this manner, the hegemony of Yejju Oromo was established over the central regions of the kingdom, including the city of Gondar, which they ruled from their residence at Debre Tabor. Regarding the political geography of the kingdom, there was further political disintegration which gave rise to additional political units. The major re -\ngional divisions of the period were Tigray in the north; Simien, Dembiya, Begemdir, Lasta, Amhara, Yejju and Wollo in the center; and Gojjam and Shewa in the south. All political units did not have equal status. Based on their resources and the power of their regional lords, their status was different. \nThe political disintegration had its own impact on foreign relations. The most powerful \nregions conducted their own foreign affairs independently of Gondar. One such region was Tigray, which made use of the port of Massawa for its external dealings. The Tigrian lords did not allow foreign envoys to proceed beyond their domain. Such envoys often departed with the conviction that the Tigrian lords were the kings of the Christian high -\nland kingdom. Similarly, Shewa conducted its own foreign relations via Aussa and Tajura independently."

This threat came from Egypt \nafter the rise of Muhammad Ali, who extended Egypt`s rule over the Sudan in 1821. From the Sudan, the Egyptians began to encroach on the western frontiers of the Christian highland kingdom. The Egyptian occupation of Sudan, and the general political situation in Ethiopia laid fertile grounds for Egyptian expansion. The Egyptian threat coincided with a period of economic, political and religious crisis in Ethiopia. As a result of this, the responsibility of checking Egyptian expansion fell on the shoulders of local chiefs and peoples. Among the local notables who fought against Egyptian aggression were Dejjazmach Wube of Semien, Dejjazmach Kinfu and Kasa Hailu (later, Emperor Tewodros II) of Quara. However, it was only after the era of the princes was over that Egyptian aggression became more serious. \nThe immediate consequences of the political disorder of the period mainly affected the \nlives of the peasantry. The peasantry was forced to fight the endless wars of the provincial lords. What the peasants produced was also plundered by the regional army. At times, their farms became battlefields. As a result, many people abandoned their normal pro -\nfessions and became shiftas (bandits). Such groups also relied mainly on the peasantry for their supply. The merchants were also unable to conduct trade peacefully. They were either robbed by bandits or forced to pay taxes at several kellas (custom posts) by the regional lords. The traditional handicrafts were also disrupted. On the whole, the wars of the Zemene Mesafit caused decline in agricultural production, stagnation in trade and the collapse of handicrafts, which impoverished the people of the region where most of the wars were fought. In one way or another, the country’s backwardness is attributed to such periods of political instability. \nThe ZemeneMesafint came to an end in 1855. The man who initiated the process of \nrestoring the power and authority of the monarchy was Emperor Tewodros II. Tewodros began his career as a bandit in Quara, Dembiya. At the time, his name was Kasa Hailu. Dejjazmach Kasa got rid of the powerful regional lords in four major battles. At the battle of Gur Amba in November 1852, he defeated Dejjazmach Goshu Zewde of Gojjam, and in April 1853, four vassals of Ras Ali II fell at the battle of Gorgora Bichen. The next vic -\ntim was Ras Ali II himself, the then Rasbitweded who was defeated at the battle of Ayshal in June 1853. The last powerful regional lord, Dejjazmech Wube of Tigray and Semien, was defeated at the battle of Deresge in 1855. In the same year, Kasa was crowned emperor by the name Tewodros II (r. 1855-1868) at the church of Deresge Mariyam."

They were called \nAbegazoch which was a common title for the Shewan governors. These administrative units were Yifat, Menz, Ankober and Merhabete. They were further divided into sub-units. For instance, Yifat was comprised of Yifat proper, Gidim and Ephrata; Menz contained Mama Midir, Lalo Midir and Gera Midir; and Merhabete included Gishe and Antsokia in the north and Moret in the south. \nAsfawossen died in 1808 and his son and successor, Wossenseged (r. 1808-1813), strove \nto strengthen his administration instead of territorial expansion. He established marriage ties with the surrounding Oromo in order to strengthen the friendship with them. Moreover, he followed a policy of religious toleration and social equality as a means of forging unity among the heterogeneous population of his kingdom. Wossenseged was the first ruler of the kingdom to assume the title of Ras. He died in June 1813, and was was succeeded by his brother, Sahle Selassie (r. 1813-1847). \nSahle Selassie was the first Shewan ruler to assume the title of Nigus (King). The power \nof Shewa reached its climax during his reign. He expanded the kingdom to the south and southwest directions. He rebuilt the church of Debre Birhan Selassie. He also appointed powerful chiefs, and arranged marriage ties with the neighboring Muslim and Oromo chiefs. \nNigus Sahle Selassie had a strong desire to make Shewa a modern and powerful kingdom \nand to acquire firearms. To this effect, he made independent contacts with the outside world through Aussa and Tajura. It was during his reign that Europeans first reached the kingdom.

He approached foreigners with a warm reception in his court and then informed them of his interests in medicine, craft and art, in the construction of towns, bridges, and mechanical devices. Moreover, he requested these Europeans for guns and masons. In the 1840s, he concluded a treaty of trade and friendship with Rochet d’ Hericourt and Major Harris, the French and British envoys respectively. \nShewa under Sahle Sellassie was greatly expanded and reached the highest degree of auton -\nomy.

One of \nthese, triumphed first in Britain and then spread to other European countries and to the United States of America, was the Industrial Revolution that brought about major political, economic, and social changes across the globe. The economic, social, and technological changes that made the Industrial Revolution possible will be given central importance. A good deal of space will also be given to look at the favourable conditions that enabled Brit -\nain to begin it first.

Special attention will be given to the extent to which the Industrial Revolution transformed the role and status of women. The second kind of revolution that we will consider in this unit is political revolution. Here, we will focus on the causes, courses, and consequences of the American and French revolutions. Last but not least, we shall look into the period of Napoleon Bonaparte: the reforms he introduced, the several wars he fought and their causes, his positive achievements, and the limitations of his rule.

Before the Industrial Revolution, people wove \ntextiles by hand in workshops. During the Industrial Revolution, machines began to replace manual labour. From England, the Industrial Revolution spread to Europe and North Amer -\nica. The important industries which were transformed by the Industrial Revolution were textiles, iron, mechanical engineering, chemical manufacturing and transportation mainly the steam ships and railways.\nThe Agricultural Revolution of the early 18\nth century paved the way for the industrial revo -\nlution.  By 1700, wealthy landowners began buying much of the land that village farmers \nhad once worked. Wealthy landowners enclosed their land with fences. The increase in their landholdings enabled them to cultivate larger fields. They also dramatically improved farming methods, which amounted to an agricultural revolution. Within these larger fields, called enclosures, landowners experimented with more productive seeding and harvesting methods to increase crop yields. Large landowners forced small farmers to become tenant farmers or to give up farming and move to the cities. \nScientific farmers saw that the usual way of sowing seed by scattering (broadcasting) it \nacross the ground was wasteful. Many seeds failed to take root. They solved this problem with an invention called the seed drill in about 1701. It allowed farmers to sow seeds in well-spaced rows at specific depths. A larger share of the seeds took root, increasing crop yields. \nThe process of crop rotation has proved to be one of the best developments by the sci-\nentific farmers. Livestock breeders improved their methods, too.As food supplies increased and living conditions improved, England`s population increased. An increasing population 9.1. The Industrial Revolution"

As farmers lost their land to \nlarge enclosed farms, many became factory workers.\nWhy did the Industrial Revolution Begin in England?\nIn addition to a large population of workers, England had extensive natural resources. In -\ndustrialization, which is the process of developing machine production of goods, requires \nsuch resources. These natural resources included water power and coal to fuel the new ma -\nchines, iron ore to construct machines, tools, and buildings, rivers for inland transportation, and harbors from which merchant ships set sail. \nBesides, Britain had an expanding economy to support industrialization. Business people \ninvested in the manufacture of new inventions. Britain`s highly developed banking system also contributed to the country`s industrialization. People were encouraged by the availabil -\nity of bank loans to invest in new machinery and expand their operations. Growing overseas trade, economic prosperity, and a climate of progress have led to an increased demand for goods. \nBritain`s political stability gave the country a tremendous advantage over its neighbors. \nThough Britain took part in many wars during the 1700s (18\nth century) none occurred \non British soil. Their military successes gave the British a positive attitude. Parliament also passed laws to help encourage and protect business undertakings. Britain, therefore, had all the factors of production, (land, labor and capital), that the Industrial Revolution required. \nInventions Spur Industrialization\nNew inventions have revolutionized industry. Britain`s textile industry supplied the world \nwith wool, linen, and cotton cloths. This industry was the first to be transformed. Cloth merchants boosted their profits by speeding up the process by which spinners and weav -\ners made cloth. Several major inventions have modernized the cotton industry. In 1733, a machinist named John Kay made a shuttle that sped back and forth on wheels. This flying shuttle, a boat-shaped piece of wood to which yarn was attached, doubled the amount of work a weaver could do in a day. Around 17 64, a textile worker named James Hargreaves invented a spinning jenny, which allowed one spinner to work eight threads at a time.  \nAt first, textile workers operated the flying shuttle and the spinning jenny by hand. Then, \nRichard Arkwright invented the water frame in 17 69. This machine used the waterpower from rapid streams to drive spinning wheels. In 1779, Samuel Crompton combined features"

The spinning mule \nmade thread that was stronger, finer, and more consistent than earlier spinning machines. Run by waterpower, Edmund Cartwright’s power loom sped up weaving after its invention in 1787 . The water frame, the spinning mule, and the power loom were bulky and expensive machines. They took the work of spinning and weaving out of the house. Wealthy textile merchants set up the machines in large buildings called factories. Factories needed water -\npower, so the earlier ones were built near rivers and streams.\nFigure 9.1.  Arkwright`s First Spinning Frame                              The Steam Engine\nEngland`s cotton came from plantations in the American South in the 1790s. Removing seeds from the raw cotton by hand was hard work. In 1793, an American inventor named Eli Whitney invented a machine to speed up the job. His cotton gin multiplied the amount of cotton that could be cleaned. \nImprovements in Transportation \nProgress in the textile industry encouraged other industrial improvements. The first of such development, the steam engine, stemmed from the search for a cheap, convenient source of power. As early as 1705, coal miners were using steam powered pumps to remove water from deep mine shafts. But this early model of a steam engine wasted great quantities of fuel, making it expensive to run.  \nJames Watt, a mathematical instrument maker thought about the problem for two years. In \n17 65, Watt figured out a way to make the steam engine work faster and more efficiently while burning less fuel. An American inventor named Robert Fulton ordered a steam en -\ngine from an early British engineering and manufacturing firm. He built a steamboat called"

The Clermont later transported \npassengers. \nIn England, water transportation improved with the creation of a network of canals, or hu -\nman-made waterways. British roads improved, too, thanks largely to the efforts of John Mc \nAdam, a Scottish engineer. Private investors formed companies that built roads and then operated them for profit. \nSteam-driven machinery powered English factories in the late 18\nth century. A steam engine \non wheels (the railroad locomotive) drove English industry after 1820. In 1804, an English \nengineer named Richard Trevithick invented a steam-driven locomotive. Other British engi -\nneers soon built improved versions of Trevithick`s locomotive. One of these early rail road engineers was George Stephenson. In 1821, he began work on the world`s first railroad line, which began work the next year. \nThe invention and perfection of the locomotive had at least four major effects. First, rail -\nroads prompted industrial growth by giving manufacturers a cheap way to transport ma -\nterials and finished products. Second, the railroad boom created hundreds of thousands \nof new jobs for both railroad workers and miners. Third, the railroads increased England`s agricultural and fishing industries, which could transport their products to distant cities. Fi -\nnally, by making travel easier, railroads encouraged country people to take distant city jobs. \nThe Industrial Revolution affected every part of life in Great Britain, but with many problems. \nEventually, industrialization led to a better quality of life for most people. But the change to machine production initially caused human suffering. Rapid industrialization brought plen -\ntiful jobs, but it also caused unhealthy working conditions, air and water pollution, and the problems of child labor. It also led to rising class tensions, especially between the working class and the middle class.\nThe pace of industrialization has accelerated rapidly in Britain. By the 1800s, people could \nearn higher wages in factories than on farms. With this money, more people could afford to heat their homes. They wore better clothing, too, woven on power looms in England`s industrial cities. \nFor centuries, most Europeans had lived in rural areas. After 1800, the balance shifted \ntoward cities. This shift was caused by the growth of the factory system, where the manufac -\nturing of goods was concentrated in a central location. Most of Europe`s urban areas have at least doubled in population; some have even quadrupled. This period was a period of"

As a result, the average worker spent 1 4 hours a day on the job, 6 days a week. Industry also posed new dangers for workers. Factories were seldom well lit or clean. Machines injured workers. And there was no government program to provide aid in case of injury. The most dangerous conditions of all were found in coal mines. Frequent accidents, damp conditions, and the constant breathing of coal dust made the average miner`s life span ten years shorter than that of other workers. Many women and children were em -\nployed in the mining industry because they were the cheapest source of labor.\nClass Tensions Grow\nThough poverty gripped Britain`s working classes, the Industrial Revolution created enor -\nmous amounts of wealth in the nation. Most of this new money belonged to factory own -\ners, shippers, and merchants. These people were part of a growing middle class, a social class made up of skilled workers, professionals, business people, and wealthy farmers. \nThe new middle class transformed the social structure of Great Britain. In the past, land -\nowners and aristocrats had occupied the top position in British society. Now some factory \nowners, merchants, and bankers grew wealthier than the landowners and aristocrats. Yet, im -\nportant social distinctions divided the two wealthy classes. The upper middle class consist -\ned of government employees, doctors, lawyers, and managers of factories, mines, and shops. The lower middle class included factory overseers and such skilled workers as toolmakers, mechanical drafters, and printers. These people enjoyed a comfortable standard of living. \nDuring the years 1800 to 1850, however, laborers, or the working class, saw little improve-\nment in their living and working conditions. They watched their livelihoods disappear as machines replaced them. In frustration, some smashed the machines they thought were putting them out of work. One group of such workers was called the Luddites. They were named after Ned Ludd. Ludd, probably a laborer, was said to have destroyed weaving ma-chinery around 1779. The Luddites attacked whole factories in northern England from 181 1 to 1816, destroying labor saving machinery. Outside the factories, mobs of workers rioted, mainly because of poor living and working conditions."

Workers breaking machines during the Luddit Movement in England.\nDespite the problems that followed industrialization, the Industrial Revolution had a num-\nber of positive effects. It created jobs for workers; contributed to the wealth of the nation; fostered technological progress and invention; and greatly increased the production of goods and raised the standard of living. Perhaps most importantly, The industrial revolution provided the hope of improvement in people`s lives. Other benefits included healthier diets, better housing, cheaper, mass-produced clothing, and expanded educational opportunities.\nIn industrialized countries of the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution opened a wide gap \nbetween the rich and the poor. Business leaders believed that governments should stay out of business and economic affairs. Reformers, however, felt that governments needed to play an active role in improving conditions for the poor. Workers also demanded more rights and protection. They formed labor unions to increase their influence. \nThe Philosophers of Industrialization\nThe term laissez faire refers to the economic policy of letting owners of industry and busi -\nnesses set working conditions without interference from the governing bodies. This policy \nfavours a free market economy. The term is French for “let do,” and by extension, “let people do as they please.” Laissez-faire economics stemmed from the French economic philoso -\nphers of the Enlightenment. They criticized the idea of nations growing wealthy by placing heavy tariffs on foreign goods. These philosophers believed that if the government allowed free trade—the flow of commerce in the world market without government regulation—the economy would prosper. Adam Smith was one of these who defended the idea of a free market economy in his 177 6 book entitled The Wealth of Nations. According to Smith, economic liberty guaranteed economic progress. As a result, the government should not in -\nterfere. Smith`s arguments rested on what he called the three natural laws of economics: the"

Laissez-faire thinkers opposed government efforts to help poor workers. They thought that creating minimum wage laws and better working conditions would trouble the free market system, lower profits, and undermine the production of wealth in society. \nThe Rise of Socialism\nIn contrast to laissez-faire philosophy, which advises governments to leave business alone, \nother scholars believe that governments should intervene. These thinkers believed that wealthy people or the government must take action to improve people`s lives. French re-formers such as Charles Fourier and Saint-Simon sought to counterweight the ill effects of industrialization with a new economic system called socialism. In socialism, the factors of production are owned by the public and operate for the welfare of all. Socialism grew out of an optimistic view of human nature, a belief in progress, and a concern for social justice. It argues that the government should plan the economy. Advocates argued that government control of factories, mines, railroads, and other key industries would end poverty and pro-mote equality. They believed that public ownership would help workers, who were at the mercy of their employers.  \nThe writings of a German journalist named Karl Marx introduced the world to a radical \ntype of socialism called Marxism. Marx and later Friedrich Engels defined their ideas in a pamphlet called The Communist Manifesto published in 1848. Marx and Engels said that human societies have always been divided into opposing classes. In their own time, these were the middle class “haves” or employers, called the bourgeoisie, and the “have-nots” or workers, called the proletariat. While the wealthy controlled the means of producing goods, the poor performed hard labor under terrible conditions. This situation resulted in conflict. According to Marx and Engels, the Industrial Revolution enriched the wealthy and impov -\nerished the poor. \n     \n Activity 9.1\n1.

The French also colonized \nparts of North America throughout the 1600s and 1700s.In 1754, war erupted between \nthe English and the French. The conflict was known as the Seven Years War. The fighting lasted until 17 63, when Britain and her colonists emerged victorious. \nThe victory, however, only led to growing tensions between Britain and its colonists. In order \nto fight the war, Great Britain had spent a huge sum of money. Because American colonists benefited from Britain’s victory, Britain expected the colonists to help pay for the costs of the war. In 17 65, Parliament passed the Stamp Act. According to this law, colonists had to pay a tax to have an official stamp put on wills, deeds, newspapers, and other printed ma -\nterial. American colonists were outraged. They had never paid taxes directly to the British government before. Colonial lawyers argued that the stamp tax violated colonists’ natural rights, and they accused the government of “taxation without representation.” In Britain, citi -\nzens agreed to pay taxes through their representatives in Parliament. The colonists, however, had no representation in parliament. Thus, they argued they could not be taxed. \nOver the next decade, hostilities between the two sides increased. Some colonial leaders \nfavored independence from Britain. In 1773, to protest an import tax on tea, a group of colonists dumped a large load of British tea into Boston Harbor. George III, enraged by the “Boston Tea Party,” as it was called, ordered the British navy to close the port of Boston. Such harsh tactics by the British further worsened relationships. \nIn September 1774, representatives from every colony except Georgia gathered in Philadel -9.2. The American War of Independence"

On April 19, 1775, British sol -\ndiers and American militiamen exchanged gunfire in Lexington, Massachusetts. The fighting spread to nearby Concord. The Second Continental Congress voted to raise an army and organize for battle under the command of a Virginian named George Washington. The American Revolution had begun. \nFigure 9.3 George Washington\nThe Revolution in America was influenced by the Enlightenment, also known as the age of reason. Colonial leaders used Enlightenment ideas to justify independence. The colonists had asked for the same political rights as people in Britain, they said, but the king had in -\nflexibly refused. Therefore, the colonists were justified in rebelling against a tyrant who had broken the social contract. On July 4, 177 6, the Second Continental Congress issued the Declaration of Independence. From this time on, Americans celebrate July 4\nth as a national \nholiday every year. This document, drafted by the political leader, Thomas Jefferson, was firmly based on the ideas of John Locke and the Enlightenment. The Declaration reflected these ideas in its well-expressed argument for natural rights. “We hold these truths to be self-evident,” states the beginning of the Declaration, “that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Since Locke had asserted that people had the right"

The document ended by declaring the colonies’ separation from Britain. The colonies, the Declaration said, “are liberated from all allegiance to the British crown.” \nThe British were not about to let their colonies leave without a fight. Shortly after the \npublication of the Declaration of Independence, the two sides went to war. At first glance, the colonists seemed destined to go down in quick defeat. Washington’s disparate, poorly trained army faced the well-trained forces of the most powerful country in the world. In the end, however, the Americans won their war for independence.\nFigure 9.4 Declaration of Independence, July 4, 177 6\nSeveral reasons explain the colonists’ success. First, the Americans’ motivation for fighting was much stronger than that of the British. Second, the overconfident British generals made several mistakes. Third, time itself was on the side of the Americans. The British could win battle after battle, as they did, and still lose the war. Fighting an overseas war, 3,000 miles from London, was terribly expensive. After a few years, tax-weary British citizens called for peace. Finally, the Americans did not fight alone. Louis XVI of France had little sympathy for the ideals of the American Revolution. However, he was eager to weaken France’s rival, Britain. French entry into the war in 1778 was decisive. In 1781, a combined force of about 9,500 Americans and 7 ,800 French trapped a British army commanded by Lord Cornwallis near Yorktown, Virginia. Unable to escape, Cornwallis eventually surrendered. The Ameri -\ncans won their independence."

The privileged people on \nthe other hand did not pay taxes and were treated well. Before the revolution, the French people were divided into three estates. The First Estate was made up of high-ranking mem -\nbers of the Catholic Church. The Second Estate was comprised of the nobility. The First and the Second Estates were the privileged classes. The Third Estate, which was made up of peasants in the countryside, artisans, city workers, and wealthy bourgeoisie merchants in the cities, was the unprivileged class, but the majority. \nFigure 9.5 Convocation of the Estates General\nFrance’s economy under the Old Regime was based primarily on agriculture. Peasant farm-ers of France bore the burden of taxation. Before the revolution there were years of poor harvests that put peasants in trouble with paying their regular taxes. The Bourgeoisie, who often managed to gather wealth, were upset that they paid taxes while nobles did not. Again France was bankrupt because the king (Louis XVI) lavished money on himself and residences like Versailles. Queen Marie Antoinette, his wife, was seen as a wasteful spender. Besides, the government found its funds depleted as a result of wars including the funding of the American Revolution. Deficit spending – a government spending more money than it takes in from tax revenues, greatly damaged the economy of France. What was worse was that the privileged classes would not submit to being taxed.\nThe French Revolution drew heavily on the intellectual movement of the Enlightenment, \nwhich was also known as the Age of Reason. Philosophes were secular in thinking-they used reason and logic, rather than faith, religion, and superstition, to answer important questions. They applied reason and logic to determine how governments are formed; they tried to figure out what logical, rational principles work to tie people to their governments. Again, they questioned the divine right of kings."

At this time, the royal family sought help from Austria. In June, 179 1, they were caught trying to escape to Austria. Nobles who fled the revolution and lived abroad hoped that, with foreign help, the Old Regime could be restored in France. Church officials wanted Church lands, rights, and privileges restored.

Louis XVI was guillotined on January 21, 1793 to be followed, on October 16, 1793, by Marie Antoinette, his wife. The three most memorable Jacobins were Georges Danton, Maximilien Robespierre, and Jean Paul Marat. \nAs the coalition against the French mounted, the Convention drafted Frenchmen into the \narmy to defeat the foreign coalition. Rouget de Lisle wrote the “Marseillaise,” the French national anthem. It inspired troops as they were led into battle.  After two years of fighting, the external coalition was defeated. France had gained, rather than lost, territory. Despite military successes, the Convention continued to face problems domestically.

The first part of his rule was known as the Consulate period that lasted from 1799 to 1804. As First Consul, Napoleon behaved more like an absolute ruler.He sought to govern France by demanding loyalty to the state, rewarding ability, and creating an effective hierarchical bureaucracy. Napoleon may be thought of as the last and most eminent of the enlightened despots. During this initial phase of his rule, Napoleon introduced important reforms. \nPerhaps the longest lasting legacy of Napoleon’s rule is the Napoleon Code, which pro -\nvided legal unity. This was the first clear and complete codification of French Law. The law \nincluded a civil code, code of criminal procedure, a commercial code, and a penal code. It emphasized the protection of private property. This in turn gave rise to a strong central government and administrative unity. Many achievements of the Revolution such as equality before the law (no more estates, legal classes, privileges, local liberties, hereditary offices, guilds, or manors), freedom of religion, secularism (separation of state and religion), prop -\nerty rights, and the abolition of serfdom, were made permanent.  \nWomen gained inheritance rights but were denied equal status with men (except inheritance \nrights). Women and children were legally dependent on their husband or father. Divorce was more difficult to obtain than during the Revolution. Women could not buy or sell property or begin a business without the consent of their husbands. The income earned by wives went to their husbands. Penalties for adultery were far more severe for women than for men. \nAnother major reform was the value placed on talent to improve careers. Citizens were the -\noretically able to rise in government service purely according to their abilities. However, new \nimperial nobility was created to reward the most talented generals and officials. Wealth de -\ntermined status. The middle class benefited significantly. The government rewarded wealthy people who effectively served the state with pensions, property or titles. \nThe third major reform was in the area of religion. An agreement known as the Concordat \nof 1801was made with the Catholic Church. In this agreement, Napoleon sought to weaken the power of pro Burbon monarchs. He again believed in the power of religion in making people accept economic inequality. Some other provisions include the church would never laid claims pre-revolutionary property, the replacement of disloyal clergy with those who supported the state, and freedom of worship."

The government established sound currency and public credit. Economic reforms stimulated the economy by providing food at low prices and increasing employe-ment, lowering taxes on farmers, and tax collections became more efficient. \nEducational reforms were based on a system of public education under state control. In \nthe area of intelligence, Napoleon introduced a spy system that kept thousands of citizens under continuous surveillance. Oppositions were ruthlessly suppressed and suspects were thrown in prison, if not executed without valid evidence. The major drawbacks of Napo -\nleon’s reforms include severe inequality for women, workers were not allowed to form trade unions, the state repressed liberty, subverted republicanism, and restored absolutism in France through the creation of a police state, and he practiced nepotism by placing his relatives on the thrones of nations he conquered.\nDuring the era of the Consulate, Napoleon fought many short wars with the major Euro -\npean powers, like Britain, Austria, Sardina, and Russia. However, many of these wars were \nmade with Britain. It was not until 1813 that these major European powers came together to fight against France. Only gradually, after Napoleon had conquered Italy, did they decide Napoleon had to be defeated for a peaceful Europe. The first of such wars was the Battle of the Niles fought in North Africa in 1879, in which the British scored a victory. However, Napoleon scored a victory in Europe and gained territories both from Austria and Italy. However, his attempt to suppress a slave rebellion in Saint Domingue, Haiti, in 1804 was a fiasco as the latter defeated the French and achieved independence. In the next year, 1805, France sold the Lousinian territory to the United Stated of America.\nThe period from 1804 to 181 4 was known as the Empire period characterized by repeated \nwar and defeat. In an attempt to prevent a probable return of the Bourbons to power, on December 2, 1804, Napoleon made himself emperor of France. He viewed himself as a champion of freedom for subject peoples who were under absolute rulers of Europe, which in the process enlarged the French empire. Beginning in 1805, Napoleon engaged in con -\nstant warfare. Eventually, Napoleon achieved the largest empire since Roman times.France extended to the Rhine, including Belgium and Holland, the German coast to the western Baltic, and the Italian coast extended down to Rome."

In 1805, he decided to invade Britain. This move was seen as a major threat to the balance of power in Europe. As a result, Austria and Tsarist Russia came on the side of Britain. On October 21, 1805, the British navy destroyed the French and Spanish armies at the battle of Tra -\nfalgar. However, temporal defeats here and there did not prevent him from establishing a huge empire in Europe. By the treaty of Tilsit, signed in June 1807 , Prussia and Russia lost a considerable number of territorial claims. Once placed in his hands, Napoleon sought to reorganize Germany. He brought 15 states together and named the Confederation of the Rhine, which indirectly assisted the unification process.\nAfter his defeat at the battle of Trafalgar, Napoleon sought to damage the economy of Brit-\nain. To this end, he introduced the Continental System, which closed ports on the continent to British commerce. In 1812, The United States of America came to support the causes of Britain. America’s concern for British commerce coupled with incipient infrastructural development made the Continental System a failure.\nThe events that unfolded after 1808 were not good for Napoleon. From 1808 to 1812, \nhe had to fight against the Spainiards who rejected the candidacy of Napoleon’s brother for the Spanish throne. In the ensuing war, Napoleon met with defeat. In 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia in which he suffered a major defeat.  In the years 1813/’1 4, Napoleon had to fight a coalition of Russian, Prussian, Austrian and British armies. In October, 1813, Na -\npoleon was finally defeated by the coalition force at the battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of Nations.

The Quadruple Alliance was created in March, 181 4. Accordingly, each power agreed to provide 150,000 soldiers to enforce peace terms.Napoleon abdicated as emperor on April 4, 181 4 after allied armies entered Paris. The Bourbons were restored to the throne under the person of Louis XVIII. By the Treaty of Paris signed on May 30, 181 4, France surrendered all territory gained since the Wars of the Revolution began in 1792.\nThe Quadruple Alliance agreed to meet in Vienna to work out a general peace settlement. \nAccordingly, the Congress of Vienna was held from September 181 4-June 1815 where rep -\nresentatives of the major powers of Europe, including France, met to redraw territorial lines and to try to restore the social and political order of the old regime.Klemens Von Metter -\nnich represented Austria.He epitomized a conservative reaction to the French Revolution and its aftermath and opposed the ideas of liberals and reformers because of the impact such forces would have on the multinational Hapsburg Empire. England was represented by Lord Castlereagh.He sought a balance of power by surrounding France with larger and stronger states.Prussia sought to recover Prussian territory lost to Napoleon in 1807 and gain additional territory in northern Germany (e.g. Saxony).Tsar Alexander I represented Russia.He demanded a “free” and “independent” Poland, with himself as its king.France later became involved in the deliberations and was represented by Talleyrand, the French Foreign Minister. \nThe principles of settlement include legitimacy, compensation and balance of power. Legit -\nimacy meant returning to power the ruling families deposed by more than two decades of \nrevolutionary warfare. Accordingly, the Bourbons were restored in France, Spain, and Naples. Dynasties were restored in Holland, Sardinia, Tuscany and Modena.The Papal States were returned to the pope.\nCompensation meant territorially rewarding those states which had made considerable sac -\nrifices to defeat Napoleon. Accordingly, England received naval bases (Malta, Ceylon, Cape \nof Good Hope). Austria recovered the Italian province of Lombardy and was awarded adja -\ncent Venetia as well as Galicia (from Poland), and the Illyrian Provinces along the Adriatic. Russia was given most of Poland, with the Tsar as king, as well as Finland and Bessarabia (modern-day Moldova and western Ukraine). Prussia was awarded the Rhineland, 3/5 of Saxony, and part of Poland, and Sweden received Norway. The balance of Power arranged the map of Europe so that never again could one state upset the international order and cause a general war."

He controlled power for one hundred days, from March 20 to June 22, 1815.The Hundred Days began on March 1, 1815, when Napoleon landed in the south of France and marched with large-scale popular support, into Paris.He seized power from Louis XVIII, who fled Paris.

However, his advance was fi -\nnally halted at the battle of Waterloo, Belgium, fought in June 1815, by England’s army led by the Duke of Wellington and Prussian forces.

Explain briefly the important decisions that were made at the Congress of Vienna.\n5. Which reforms of Napoleon do you appreciate most? Why?\nummary Before it became evident in other parts of Europe and America, it was in Britain \nthat the Industrial Revolution first triumphed. We call it a revolution because it consider-\nably transformed the political and economic statures of states and significantly changed \nthe lives of human beings. Intrestingly enough, it brought about major changes in the role \nand status of women. New ideas such as government based on the consent of the people, \nfreedom of speech, liberty, equality, and fraternity, separation of power and the power of \nreason, and secularism propounded by the philosophes of the period of the enlighten-\nment were at the roots of the revolutionary movements in America and France. One major \noutcome of the revolutionary movements of the period was constitutionalism, which pro-\nfoundly assisted the democratization process of the political system of the modern world."
