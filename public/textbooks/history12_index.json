Many historians agree that fully fledged capitalism emerged in North -\nwestern Europe, especially in Great Britain and the Netherlands, from the 16\nth to \n17thcenturies, when mercantilism was established. Mercantilism is defined as the \ndistribution of goods that are bought at a certain price and sold at a higher price in order to generate profits. The ethics fostered by the Protestant Reformation of the 16\nth century helped to consolidate capitalism in the Western world. Moreover, \ncapitalism enjoyed the benefits of the rise of strong nation states in Europe. These nation-states succeeded in supporting the development of capitalism through reg-ulations, uniform monetary systems, public investment, etc. and eventually made \npossible the shift from public to private initiative.

They believed that a state could \nonly increase its wealth at the expense of another state’s wealth while the amount of the world’s wealth remained constant. As a result of the decline in mercantilism, industrial capitalism arose in the mid-18\nth century due to the vast accumulation of \ncapital during the phase of merchant capitalism and its investment in machinery. Industrial capitalism marked development of manufacturing factory system and led to the global domination of capitalist mode of production.\nCapitalism had the following main characteristic features: \n1.Capitalism is an economic system characterized by private ownership of the \nmeans of production, especially in the industrial sector. The economy is run by individuals (or corporations) who own and operate companies and make decisions on the use of resources. \n2.Capitalist society was characterized by the split between two antagonistic classes: the capitalist class (the owners), which owned the means for pro-duction (property, plants, and equipment) and the working class, which sold their labor to the capitalist class in exchange for wages. \n3.Unlike the previous systems, capitalism used accumulated capital to enlarge productive capacity rather than to invest in economically unproductive enter -\nprises, such as pyramids and cathedrals. \n4.The motive for all companies in the capitalist system is to make and sell goods and services only for profits.\n5. Capitalist societies believe markets should be left alone to operate without government intervention. This idea is known as laissez-faire. True capitalists believe that a free market will always create the right amount of supply to meet demand and all prices will adjust accordingly.\nThe ideology of classical capitalism was articulated by Adam Smith (1723-1790) in his book entitled: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Na-tions (1776). He was a Scottish economist and moral philosopher, who is considered \nto be one of the fore father’s of capitalism. Smith recommended leaving economic decisions to the free play of self-regulating market forces. Smith supported the idea"

As Marx suggested, in the socialist system where there was no private ownership and all means of production were collective or state-owned, central planning determined how much should be produced and \nhow all resources were allocated. \nTherefore, the antithesis of capitalism is Marxian Economics, named after Karl Marx. \nHe believed that capitalism brings about class segregation between the capitalist class and the working class. According to Marx, the exploitation of the surplus val -\nue of labour is one of the major drawbacks of capitalism. He said that the working people possess personal property or capital in the form of their labour. By selling their labour to other persons, workers enter into wage labour contracts. The work -\ners profit from their labour and may use the subsequent earnings to buy necessi -\nties. The employer, however, also earns a profit from the workers labour. Marx also argued that capitalist economies would weaken in systematic crises. These crises would cause social disturbance. Wealth would become more and more concentrated into the hand of even more privileged class. Marx also predicted the inevitable over-throw of capitalism in a proletarian-led class war.\nFigure 1.1 Karl Marx and Fredric Engels\nActivity 1.1\n1.Organize a classroom debate in support or against the ideology of classical capi-\ntalism versus Marxian Economics."

It took place in Britain in the period between 1750/1780 and 1850. The industrial revolution was preceded and made possible by a long period of change and development going back at least to the mid-16\nthcentury \nand even to the Middle Ages. Moreover, change and development did not cease in the 1850’s but continued because of industrialization and the change which it brought was a continuing process.  However, by 1850, Britain was already a mature industrial state. Its major industries and its transport system had been transformed by machin-ery and steam power. \nThe industrial revolution meant that industrial production in major industries was \ntransformed so that far greater and cheaper production was possible than ever be-fore. This cheap mass production was achieved by interconnecting organizational and technological changes. These organizational and technological changes were at the heart of the Industrial Revolution.There was a change from dispersed produc -\ntion in small units under the old putting out system to the new factory system of the industrial revolution. Under the new factory system industrial production was concentrated in large units, i.e., the factories which employed many workers in each factory. The industrial capitalist owned the factory and built the machinery in the factory. The power unit which operated the machinery, the raw materials processed"

The wage workers in the factories were hired and dismissed at the will of the industrial capitalist. The factory system and the pow -\ner operated machinery which went with the factory system had several advantages for the factory owner. The factory system was more productive, i.e., it enabled far more production in a given time at lower unit cost.  The factory system was there -\nfore, more profitable provided that the goods which were produced could be sold. By 1850, the factory system was dominant in major industries in Britain, especially the cotton textile industry of Lancashire in the northwest of England. Small workshops and the putting out system still survived on a large scale in many industries, but the future belonged to the factory system. \nMachines in factories replaced or complemented work done by hand with human \nstrength and skill. The industrial revolution took machinery a stage further. There were more machines of new types, and they were more complex and larger. The size and expense of machinery in the industrial revolution meant that by the late 18\nth cen-\ntury the employment of these machines required industrial capitalists and factory systems. The new machines in factories and elsewhere employed inanimate power. Inanimate power from water and from the wind has been used since the Middle Ages or in the case of sailing ships since ancient times. However, as the economy expanded and when industry needed a form of power greater than water could provide and more flexible than waterpower, a new form of power came into use, i.e., steam power. The heat to generate steam came from burning coal, which in Britain was cheap and abundant. The first commercially viable steam engine was constructed by Newcom-en around 1705/1709. But it could only be used for pumps chiefly in mining. James Watt in 1783/84 made a steam engine which was more powerful and more econom-ical in its use of fuel and adapted to operate machinery in factories.  From 1780s, more and more factories adopted steam power.\nSteam power was also applied to land transport in the form of railways. The first \nmodern railway was operated entirely by steam locomotives and carried passengers as well as freight. The Liverpool and Manchester railway was opened in 1830. By 1850, a network of railways connected all important places in Britain."

The ba -\nsic economic problem in industrial states was no longer the scarcity of commodities. \nInstead, the main problem became overproduction and the consequent difficulty of selling the commodities which were produced. Many poor people meant limited de-mand for the commodities produced. Before the industrial revolution, economic de -\npression usually resulted from wars, big epidemics, or most often bad harvests. From the industrial revolution onwards, however, a normal cause of economic depression was overproduction caused by a lack of effective demand.\nThe industrial revolution made the agricultural sector of advanced countries less \ndominant. People transferred to other sectors of the economy, and investment and production in other sectors increased. Throughout the 19\nth and 20th centuries, ad-\nvanced economies had a falling percentage of their population living in rural areas and employed in agriculture. Nevertheless, despite the decrease in the percentage of the population living in rural areas and engaged in agriculture in the more ad -\nvanced countries, agricultural productivity increased so that fewer people engaged in agriculture produced more food. In this way, agriculture could support larger ur-ban population and more people who were not engaged in agriculture. Agricultural productivity has increased in advanced countries because of the spread of better methods of agriculture. In the 19\nth and 20th centuries, science was also applied to \nincreasing agricultural production, for example, the development of artificial fertil -\nizers and pesticides.\nThe industrial revolution accelerated the shift from the country side to the towns \nand cities. More productive agriculture could feed this larger urban population. Pop -\nulation expanded rapidly in Britain and other industrialized countries of the west despite bad living and working conditions for the working class. Probably, the main reasons for this population growth were that more food was available to support a larger population and industrialization with expanding economies could provide more employment for an expanding population."

A large industrial capitalist class was added to \nthe existing bourgeoisie of merchants, professional people and bankers, making the bourgeoisie as a whole richer and more numerous. In the 19th century at different times in different countries, the bourgeoisie became the economically and politically dominant class, replacing the centuries-long domination of the land-owning nobility.\nAlongside the industrial bourgeoisie and because of industrialization, there devel-\noped the new class of the industrial proletariat. There had always been wage work -\ners, but these were now more numerous and were more and more concentrated in large factories especially in towns and cities. As the industrial proletariat became more conscious of itself as a class and more conscious that its interests were dif-ferent from and antagonistic to those of the bourgeoisie. The industrial proletariat \ncame to provide the mass base for the new doctrines of socialism and the support for working class political parties with socialist programs governments and ruling classes were alarmed by the growth of socialism in the 19\nth century.\nIndustrialization increased national wealth although this was very unevenly \ndistributed. From about 1850, industry, technology, and science were applied to armies and navies. This meant that the already existing gap in power between western states and non-western states became bigger than ever before. This meant clashes of interest and confrontations between western states and non-western states.  Conflicts could be resolved more easily by western states using military or naval force or both. Moreover, the growth of industry and the expansion of the western economy in general meant that western states became more interested in non-western areas of the world than before as sources of raw materials and as markets for export or potential markets. Also, steamships, railways and the electric telegraph (1840s on) improved transport and communications and tied the world more closely together than ever before. So that from the third quarter of the 19\nth cen-\ntury, the world became increasingly one single integrated capitalist world economy.\nThe result of all these changes was the imperialism of the late 19th century, i.e., the \nexpanding and accelerated drive for colonial acquisitions and spheres of influence.However, the earlier industrial revolution and the spread of industrialization had laid the groundwork for late-19th century imperialism. In fact, very large acquisi-tions of colonial territory took place in the 19\nth century before what is usually called \nthe “ Age of Imperialism,” beginning around 1885 or 1890.

Nationalism’s deepest roots lie in a shared sense of regional and cultural identity, especially as those roots are expressed in custom, language and religion. It influenced all classes but more so the urban than the rural peasants. \nActivity 1.4\n1.Why did nationalism influence more the urban people than peasants in the\ncountryside? What do you think is the reason behind this?\nMoreover, nationalism created the atmosphere which made World War I possible in that nationalism aggravated the great international crisis of 1905–1914 and made the peoples of Europe support the war when it broke out in July-August 1914. Na-tionalism, of course, did not begin in the middle of the nineteenth century, but it grew and intensified from then until World War I.\nThe following factors promoted the growth of nationalism in the 19\nth century:"

Governments also used compulsory military service to incul -\ncate patriotism and loyalty to the state and rulers. The cheap newspapers for the masses often had chauvinistic tones, but nationalism and hostile feelings towards neighboring states were also features of the “quality” newspapers for the upper and middle classes.\nMuch of the literature of the years before World War I was also strongly nationalist \nand warned against the dangers of neighboring countries. Patriotic societies were created to inculcate patriotism, to agitate for stronger armament, and sometimes also to agitate for bigger colonial empires. Nationalism was stimulated by the wars of unification in Italy and Germany and of national liberation in the Balkans. British nationalism was stimulated by the small colonial wars which Britain fought so often, though the second Boer War (1899-1902) was an unpleasant shock which cooled down British aggressiveness for a time until it was revived by fear of Germany. In the USA, victory in the Spanish-American War of 1898 stimulated American nationalism.\nPseudo-science also stimulated nationalism and inculcated aggressive hostile \nfeelings towards neighboring states and the idea that war was inevitable. This pseudo-science is what became known as «Social Darwinism.» It was «Social Darwinism» that spread the idea that history is a struggle between states and nations for power, supremacy and even survival. The strongest state and nation, which were the best, would be the victors, while weak states and nations would be subjugated and even destroyed.\nIn the period between the 1880s and 1914, nationalism transformed its character \nin several ways: First, more and more national movements appeared in Europe and in the Ottoman Empire outside Europe. Many of these movements were towards numerically quite small numbers of people living in quite small territories. Therefore, nationalism, which earlier in the nineteenth century had appeared to work towards greater unity, as in the case of Italy and Germany, now tends towards fragmentation. Second, language and ethnicity became the major criteria, especially language for nationalism. All over Europe, submerged minority nationalities were struggling to assert the rights of their languages to equality with previously dominated languages. \nSo there were bitter disputes over language questions.\nThird, a national question became part of the domestic politics of many states, par -"

In terms of class, the new minority nationality movements attracted the petty bourgeois, because the success of a national move -\nment and its language would mean not just more prestige for the nationality and its language but more employment in the public sector for the language speakers. Nationalism for the government was a two-edged weapon. Nationalism could be and was used to strengthen loyalty to the state and the ruler and to divert the workers away from socialism. However, where national minorities existed, nationalism could arise from the national demands of these national minorities and cause discontent and disloyalty.\nThe USA was very successful in the nineteenth century in assimilating millions \nof emigrants who came to the USA from Europe.

In the north-central part of Italy, there were the petty states of Parma, Modena and Tuscany, which were very much under Austrian influence and ruled despotically by rulers related to the Hapsburg emperor of Austria. The Papal States still covered a vast territory across Italy, consisting of the provinces of the Romagna, the Marches, Umbria and Rome and the patrimony. In addition to being the spiritual head of Catholics all over the world, the pope was the sovereign ruler of the Papal States. Since 1849, there had been a French garrison in Rome to protect the pope against any revolution and to show Austria that France had an interest in Italy and did not accept that Italy was an exclusively Austrian sphere of influence. The south of Italy and the island of Sicily were part of the kingdom of Naples. The kingdom was poor, feudal and backward. It was ruled despotically, and its king was closely al -\nlied with Austria. In the northwest of Italy was the kingdom of Piedmont, consisting of the mainland territory, which was its most important territory, and the island of Sardinia. Piedmont was the only Italian state that was really independent of Austria and that had a constitution, a parliament and civil rights, though these had only ex -\nisted since 1848. This situation made it possible for Piedmont to take the lead in the movement for Italian unification. Because liberals and nationalists all over Italy saw their best hope of a united Italy in unification with Piedmont under the constitution-al monarchy of King Victor Emmanuel II (r.1849-1878) of Piedmont.\nActivity 1.6\n1.Prepare a map that shows the Italian states mentioned above.\nThe main obstacle to Italian political unification was the power of Austria. Austria \nwanted to maintain the status quo. Another obstacle was the weakness of national sentiment in Italy. A favorable factor in the struggle for unification was the diplomat -\nic isolation of Austria after the Crimean war (1855–56) and rivalries between France and Austria in Italy, which meant that Italian nationalism was able to use French help for Italian aims.\nCamillo Cavour (1810–61) prime minister of Piedmont from 1852–62 was the main"

In 1858, Cavour met the French emperor, Napoleon III, secretly at Plombiere, in France, and succeeded in reaching an agreement with Napoleon for an alliance of France and Piedmont against Austria. Cavour contributed a lot to the successful unification of Italy. In the end, Cavour successfully gained con-trol of Lombardy, Tuscany, Parma and Modena, which greatly helped the unification process.\nIn April 1859, Cavour successfully provoked a declaration of war by Austria on \nPiedmont. Napoleon III then intervened on the side of Piedmont against Austria. The combined force invaded Lombardy and defeated the Austrian army at the Battles of Magenta and Salferino in June 1859. The Austrians were driven out of Lombardy but still held Venetia. One of the results of the Battle of Salferino was the establishment of the International Red Cross Association by the Swiss humanitarian Henri Dunant. Napoleon, however, concluded a unilateral peace treaty with Austria on the basis that Austria ceded Lombardy to Piedmont but kept Venetia.\nOther developments resulting from the war also took place. The papal province of \nRomagna and the states of Parma, Modena and Tuscany revolted against their rulers in 1859. Their rulers were overthrown. Provisional governments were established which were in close touch with the government of Piedmont and demanded union with Piedmont. Once the north had been united as the Kingdom of Italy, the unifi-cation movement turned to absorbing the powerful Kingdom of Two Sicilies in the south.  In 1860, there was an uprising in Sicily against the unpopular government of the Kingdom of Naples. At that time, the successful military leader, Garibaldi, was invited to come from Piedmont to lead the Sicilian uprising. Garibaldi agreed to lead the Sicilian uprising provided that the people accepted the program of unification with the rest of Italy under Victor Emmanuel. He recruited his famous Thousand Vol-unteers in the North and took them to Sicily, where they joined by other volunteers, advanced up the peninsula and took the city of Naples on September 7, 1860.\nThe reasons for Garibaldi’s success were: first, his own skill as a leader in guerril-\nla warfare and his magnetic personality, which made people of all classes eager to fight and die under his leadership. Second, his successful mobilization of the Sicilian masses. The masses supported him partly because of his personal qualities but also because they hoped that his movement would bring them freedom from oppression and bitter life.

The Bund was presided over by Austria, with Prussia second. The Bund was not a satisfactory form of unity for German nationalists who wanted real political unity for reasons of German nationalism and economic reasons. German nationalism was encouraged by the success of Italian national unification between 1859 and 1861. The obstacles to German unification were: Austria, which wanted to preserve the status quo. The German princes, wanted to keep their independence and the cultural differences between North and South Germany.\nIn 1861, William I (r.1861–1888) was crowned King of Prussia. He and his war min-\nister, Von Roon, proposed enlarging and reforming the Prussian army to give Prus -\nsia more influence against Austria and as security against France. But the proposal was opposed by the Prussian parliament, which refused to vote on the necessary new taxation. An important issue behind the Prussian parliament was who would control the army. The king, thus, appointed Otto von Bismarck as chief minister of Prussia. Bismarck (1815–1898) was politically conservative but a political realist and extremely able. He soon overcame the crisis by collecting additional taxation for the army reforms without the consent of Parliament. There was no resistance. Ger -\nman nationalism rapidly shifted from its liberal and democratic character in 1848 to Bismarck’s authoritarian rule.\nBismarck knew that Germany could not be united under Prussia without war against \nAustria and probably France. Austria would not give up its leadership in the Bund"

The traditional French policy was to keep Germany politi -\ncally divided and therefore weak, so that France too would probably not accept Ger -\nman unification unless France suffered a military defeat. Bismarck also knew that his \nprogram of uniting Germany would not be possible without good relations between Prussia and Russia. Therefore, he exerted all his diplomatic skills to maintain good relations with Russia. He was helped by the fact that Prussia and Russia had a com-mon interest in opposing Polish nationalism. Both Russia and Prussia, particularly the first, had large areas of former Polish territories inhabited by the Poles. There-fore, during the great Polish revolt of 1863, Prussia was the only great power that was sympathetic to Russia.\nFigure 1.3 Otto Von Bismarck\nTherefore, Bismarck accomplished this through three military successes: He first al -\nlied with Austria to defeat Denmark in a short war fought in 1864, thus acquiring Shleswig-Holstein. In 1866, with the support of Italy, he virtually created the Aus-tro-Prussian War and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Koniggratz, which, al -\nlowed him to exclude long-time rival Austria when forming the North German Con-federation with the states that had supported Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War. The Confederation was the direct precursor to the 1871 Empire. Finally, Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71). The German Confederation was transformed into an Empire with the proclamation of Prussian King Wilhelm I as German Emperor at the Palace of Versailles, to the humiliation of France."

The \nSouth resented the economic dominance of the North. The South wanted low tariffs to ensure cheaper imports from Europe while the North wanted protective tariffs to encourage their industries. The South emphasized states’ rights, i.e., the constitu-tional rights of the individual states of the USA while the North put more emphasis on the National Federal Government. However, the slavery issue outweighed all oth -\ner issues and was the only issue capable of producing secession and civil war. When the south lost control of the political institutions of the USA, they turned to secession, fearing that northern domination of the union would lead to attacks on slavery."

The new party opposed the expansion of slavery in the west-ern territories. The Republicans mobilized popular support among Northerners and Westerners who did not want to compete against slave labor.  1860 was a year of presidential election. At that time, the Republican Party had a very good candidate named Abraham Lincoln, who was an effective politician, an able speaker, and an attractive personality. He was a man who appealed to ordinary northerners because he was a self-educated man. In 1860, Lincoln’s election as President triggered seces -\nsion in the south as the south had warned before the elections. Lincoln’s election was seen as an intolerable threat to slavery in the south.\nBefore Lincoln took office, seven states seceded from the union, establishing a rebel \ngovernment, known as the Confederate States of America, on February 9, 1861. They took control of federal forts and property within their boundaries.\nFigure 1.4 Abraham Lincoln \nOn March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President of the United States. In his inaugural address, he called secession “legally void.” He stated he had no intent to invade the southern states but would use force to maintain possession of the fed -\neral property. Then, Lincoln called for all of the states in the Union to send troops to recapture the forts and preserve the Union."

Nevertheless, slavery had caused secession and therefore the causes of the civil war were both slavery and secession.\nWhy the Union prevailed (or why the Confederacy was defeated) in the Civil War has \nbeen the subject of extensive analysis and debate. Advantages are widely believed to have contributed to the union’s success. In the civil war between the North and the South, the North had most of the advantages. It had more states, a much bigger popu-lation, more skilled labor, far more industry, more railways, much greater agricultur -\nal production, except for cotton, much greater financial wealth, and also naval power to block the south and cut the south off essential imports. Although the British and French governments and ruling classes sympathized with the South’s “king cotton,” they were not strong enough to intervene in the war on the side of the south. Never-theless, the north did not win easily because the south had initially better generals and fought with great determination, and the defensive power of firearms favored the south. The war lasted from 1861 to 1865 and claimed the lives of 620,000 people.\nThe Northern motive for making the war a struggle against slavery was more accept-\nable. Thus, making the civil war a struggle against slavery would make it politically and morally impossible for any European government to support the confederacy because slavery was now regarded in Europe as obsolete, totally wrong, and totally indefensible.\nIn September 1862, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation to become effec-\ntive as of January 1\nst, 1863. The proclamation said that all slaves in rebel-held territo-\nry would be free as of January 1st, 1863. The proclamation helped the North to recruit \nAfrican American troops and many African American troops did serve with distinc -\ntion in the Northern armies. The proclamation also damaged the south by encourag-ing slaves in the confederacy to run away from the plantations especially when the northern army advanced into the south. In April 1865, the Confederacy was finally defeated unconditionally and completely. A few days later on April 14, 1865 Lincoln was assassinated by a southern fanatic named John Wilkes Booth.\nThe civil war decided once and for all the issues of secession and slavery.

This would give Russia \ngreat influence in Southeastern Europe, as it could dominate the newly independent \nstates.\nHowever, to reduce these advantages to Russia, the Great Powers (especially Britain) \ninsisted on a thorough revision of the Treaty of San Stefano. At the Treaty of Ber-\nlin on July 13, 1878, the boundaries of the new states were adjusted in the Ottoman \nEmpire’s favor. Bulgaria was divided into two states (Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia), as it was feared that a single state would be susceptible to Russian domination. Bos -\nnia and Herzegovina were transferred to Austrian control. Later, Austria-Hungary took advantage of the Ottoman crisis to annex the two provinces in 1908. This act outraged Pan-Slav nationalists in Serbia, who had long seen Serbia and anticipated a merger with Bosnia in a union of the southern Slavs. This eventually became an immediate cause of World War I.\nGermany drew away from Russia and became closer to Austria-Hungary, with whom \nit concluded the Dual Alliance in 1879. Germany was also closely allied with the Otto-man Empire. In return, the German government took over the reorganization of the Ottoman military and financial systems. It received several commercial concessions, including permission to build the Baghdad Railway, which secured for them access to several important economic markets and opened the potential for German entry into the Persian Gulf area, then controlled by Britain. German interests were driv -\nen not only by commercial interests, but also by a burgeoning rivalry with Britain and France. Meanwhile, Britain agreed to the Entente Cordiale with France in 1904, thereby resolving differences between the two countries over international affairs. Britain also made peace with Russia in 1907 with the Anglo-Russian Entente.\nActivity 1.10\n1.What were the motives behind Russian ambitions in the Balkans?\nBalkan Wars (1912-1913) \nThe Balkan Wars were two successive military conflicts that took place in the Balkan \nPeninsula in 1912 and 1913 that deprived the Ottoman Empire of all its remaining territory in Europe except part of Thrace and the city of Adrianople."

By the early 20th century, Bul -\ngaria, Greece, Montenegro and Serbia had achieved independence from the Ottoman \nEmpire, but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule. In 1912, these countries formed the Balkan League with Russian support to take Macedonia away from Turkey.\nThe First Balkan War began on October 8, 1912, and the Balkan allies were soon \nvictorious. The Turkish collapse was so complete that an armistice was signed on December 3, 1912. A peace conference began in London, but, after a coup d’état by the Young Turks in Constantinople in January 1913, war with the Ottomans contin-ued. Again, the allies were victorious: Ioánnina fell to the Greeks and Adrianople to the Bulgarians. Under a peace treaty signed in London on May 30, 1913, the Ottoman Empire lost almost all of its remaining European territory, including all of Macedonia and Albania. Albanian independence was insisted upon by the European powers, and Macedonia was to be divided among the Balkan allies.\nThe Second Balkan War erupted when the Balkan allies Serbia, Greece, and Bulgar -\nia,quarreled among themselves over the partitioning of their conquests in Macedo-\nnia.

On July 30, they concluded an armistice to end hostilities, and the Treaty of Bucharest was signed between the combatants on August 10, 1913. Under the terms of the treaty, Greece and Serbia divided most of Macedonia between themselves, leaving Bulgaria with only a small part of the region. The Balkan Wars were marked by ethnic cleansing, with all parties being responsible for grave atroc -\nities against civilians.

Capitalism is an economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of production. Capitalist society was characterized by the split between two antagonistic classes: the capitalist class (the owners) and the working class. The industrial revolution was the first establishment of industrial capitalism in any country. It took place in Britain (c.1750/1780–1851). It had far-reaching economic, social, and political effects. The result of all these changes was the imperialism of the late nineteenth century, i.e., the expanding and accelerated drive for colonial acquisi -\ntions and spheres of influence.\nNationalism has been the most powerful political force since the 1850s in the west-\nern world. Nationalism’s deepest roots lie in a shared sense of regional and cultural identity, especially as those roots are expressed in custom, language, and religion. One national issue concerning the unification of Italy and the unification of Germany dominated the international politics of Europe in the nineteenth century. Nation-alism was also an important element in the “Eastern Question,” which was a major issue in international relations since the 1850s."

After the end of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and the success of the abolitionist campaigns, the for -\nmer trade in humans or African slaves could not continue. For three centuries, the “Illegitimate Trade” in humans had dominated the commercial activities in the West African coastal areas. After the Industrial Revolution, the European colonial powers, particularly the British, took measures that first weakened and gradually abolished not only the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade but also the slave trade in general. The Eu -\nropeans introduced a new trade in West Africa which they called the “Legitimate Trade” in which the principal commodities were no more human beings or African slaves. \nDuring the first half of the 19\nth century, new West African commodities replaced \nslaves as merchandise to be exported abroad. These commodities for export includ-\ned items like gum, groundnuts, and palm. By the middle of the 19th century, palm oil \nbecame West Africa’s major export item. The ‘Legitimate Trade’, that replaced the ‘Illegitimate Trade’’, did not however economically prosper the West African states. It rather benefited most African rulers and wealthy merchants. The new “Legitimate Trade” could not bring significant improvement to the majority of West Africans. Indeed, the living condition of the people could not improve. The goods imported from Europe, which were cloth, alcoholic drinks and firearms could not contribute for the development of African native economies. The imported European clothes thoroughly weakened the development of the African indigenous craft industry. Afri-can peoples were attracted by imported European goods. The imported firearms too, had a negative impact. They not only undermined the indigenous African weapon"

In fact, the imported firearms were not modern in the true sense of the term and could not enable African rulers to protect themselves and their people from the colonial powers, who were equipped with more sophisticated weapons. The European merchants, who were involved in the “Legitimate Trade” in West Afri -\nca, had succeeded in controlling not only the export trade but also the internal trade in West Africa as well. The European traders maximized their profits as they served as intermediaries between the African merchants and the European traders. This increased commercial competition between the European merchants led to the Eu -\nropean competition which eventually culminated in the ‘Scramble for Africa’ in the 1870’s and 1880’s to control sources of raw materials and markets.\nActivity 2.11. Discuss in group the impact of the Illegitimate Trade on Africa?\n2. Can we blame only the European colonizers for the problems created in the West Africa during the Transatlantic Slave Trade?3. Was Africa involved in the Transatlantic Slave Trade? Why?\nThe Infrastructure and the Ideology of New Imperialism\nImperialism is the highest stage of capitalism. When we say New Imperialism we are referring to a period of increased expansion of capitalism that was started in the second half the 19\nth century and continued until the outbreak of the First World War. \nIn the period known as the New Imperialism, European powers wanted to control African colonies. After achieving unification, in the early 1870s, Germany and Italy joined the struggle to control territories in Africa.\nFollowing the rapid economic development that came as a result of adopting the \neconomic policy of free trade, a serious financial crisis affected the western states in the early 1870s. In order to withstand the economic crisis and protect their eco -\nnomic interest, European states began to take measures. For instance, in the 1870s and the 1880s, the two major European colonial powers, Great Britain and France partitioned the western part of the African continent into their spheres of influence. The Berlin Conference of 1884/85 enabled European powers to divide Africa among themselves. That led to the physical occupation of territories in Africa which means the intensification the colonial conquest. \nThere was European presence in Africa even before the start of the period of the New"

Before the 1870s, although the Europeans had contacts with the peoples of the coastal areas of Africa, particularly, West Africa, they were not equipped with efficient firearms to easily conquer the native peoples there. Moreover, the Europeans also lacked appro -\npriate means of communication to control Africa particularly the interior parts of Africa. \nIn general, the European colonial powers had a great difficulty to penetrate deep \ninto the African interior. At the early days of colonization, tsetse fly and mosquito had almost prevented the Europeans from entering the African interior. Eventually, the European colonizers managed to penetrate deep into the African interior with relative ease; thanks to technological advancement including the invention of better river boats, steam ship, better rifles, and the discovery of medicine to combat malar -\nia. By 1880, a relatively small number of well-armed and properly trained European soldiers had managed to easily defeat the native Africans who had a marked numer -\nical superiority over them.  \nAfter the second Industrial Revolution, many of the European states became tech -\nnologically more advanced and they developed interest to colonize un-colonized ar-\neas in Africa. Industrial development invited new powers to involve in the colonial contest. As we have already mentioned, Germany and Italy were newcomers in the colonial struggle to acquire colonies in Africa. Technology and involvement of new powers in the colonial struggle hastened the development and spread of the New Imperialism.\nThe emerging European industries needed a huge capital investment. The financial \ncapital required to run the new industries paved the way for the development of financial institutions like banking and capital markets that could finance the new industries. The expansion of industries in Europe not only demanded excess raw materials but also importing food for the then growing urban population in the in-dustrialized cities and towns. Technological advancement in maritime technology and navigation techniques enabled the European colonial powers to get raw mate -\nrials and food supply with relative ease traveling even to distant areas including the Far East. Improvement in ship building also encouraged the revival of militarism and aggression in the world. Great Britain, which was the first country to embark on the industrial revolution, was the strongest World Power of the period and had suprem-"

Soon other European colonial powers followed suit and modernized their armed forces including their navy.\nAfter the 19\nth century, the European colonial powers worked hard to consolidate \ntheir rule in the areas which they had already occupied. In fact, they also worked to \nget new colonies although there were no adequate territories to be newly colonized in Africa by then.\nThe technological boom that came as a result of the New Imperialism had some neg-\native impacts on peoples who had their own polities. The militarily superior Euro -\npean colonial states now managed to colonize the entre African continent except Ethiopia and Liberia, and many areas in Asia and the Pacific Islands. Although the European colonization of territories in Africa was started earlier, the scale had in-creased dramatically, and the European acquisition of territories reached its peak during the period known as the New Imperialism. When the First World War broke out in 1914, about 85 percent of the territories in the world had fallen under colo-nial rule.  During the First World War, the colonized people followed their colonial masters paid sacrifices in military confrontations that had nothing to do with them.\nThe Partition of Africa, Motives and Processes\nOn the eve of the European Scramble for Africa, Western Europe had conducted the industrial revolution for a century and had clearly become the most powerful and technologically advanced continent in the world. Firearms, transportation, and communication technologies were developing very quickly, and national pride was growing in each European country. Furthermore, advances in medicine have enabled Europeans to spend longer periods in the tropics free of illness. An economic decline in the early 1870’s pushed some Europeans to look toward the non-industrial world, especially the African countries. They viewed these countries as both markets for their products and suppliers of natural resources to fuel their industries. In addition, the strongest European countries began to fear what would happen to the balance of power if their rivals acquired colonies in Africa. All of this resulted in the scramble for Africa. It began with slow territorial acquisition through the early 1880’s and was followed by a competitive rush to claim African lands after the Berlin Conference (1884–1885). Therefore, you will learn about the major developments that led to the Berlin conference."

Why did Great Britain and France manage to establish big colonial empires while \nothers, like Italy and Germany, were unable to have an adequate number of colonial states in Africa?\nBecause of her position as an industrial nation in the world, Britain dominated Afri-\nca’s external trade until the second half of the 19\nth century. She produced industrial \ngoods and exported them to Africa using her largest merchant navy. This provided her with an opportunity to establish trading stations and occupy bases and coastal colonies on the continent. As their home markets became saturated, these powers turned to Africa to sell their manufactured goods. As a result “protectionism” was encouraged more than “free trade”. This in turn increased the desire of the new in -\ndustrial powers\n to establish colonies or “protected” areas in Africa.\n to establish colonies or “protected” areas in Africa.\nMap 2.1 Africa in 1880 and 1913\nWhile Britain, France and Belgium were advancing their arms into Africa, Germany, \nwas waiting for its time. In 1884, Bismarck declared a German protectorate over three African territories, namely Togoland, Cameroon and Southwest Africa (pres-ent day Namibia).

The stated goals of the conference were to be the settlement of Congo claims between Britain, France, and Portugal and the Anglo-French rivalries along the Niger River.

In fact, the Ottoman Empire which has been thoroughly weakened and lost most of its former territories was not represented in the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885. Although the main agenda in the Berlin Conference was Africa, no African country, including Ethiopia and Liberia, was invited to take part in the Conference.\nBy the time the conference ended (February 25, 1885), King Leopold of Belgium had \nsecured ownership of the Congo Free State, and the conference recognized Leopold’s so-called “International Association” as the legitimate authority in the Congo basin. In return, the Belgian king agreed to allow European traders and missionaries free access to the area.\nBased on the Berlin negotiations, Leopold proclaimed his own personal kingdom, the \n‘Congo Free State’, in 1885.  France got acceptance of its claims to the French-Congo; Portugal lost most of its Congo claims; and European powers recognized Germany’s new protectorates. The European nations declared free trade along the Congo Basin and free navigation on the Niger River. The European colonial powers also consoli-dated their rule in the areas they already occupied and set out rules to occupy addi -\ntional new territories.  Nevertheless, the most significant of these rules or General Act of Berlin was Article 36.  It stated that colonial powers were obligated to notify each other when they claimed African territory.

The Africans attempted to resist the European colonizers as much as they could. The colonial powers employed different methods to colonize Africa. They used fake treaties to extend their control of the continent. When treaties failed to bring them what they wanted, the European colonizers resorted to the use of force. The Af-ricans, on the other hand, reacted to the colonial aggression in two ways. The African reaction to colonial rule included both peaceful and violent methods. Practically, the African society resisted the colonizers using any means, and there was resistance in almost every region of European advance. But there were differences in the intensity of resistance from one region to another. The African resistance had a clear ideologi -\ncal basis, that is, the resistance was an attempt to safeguard their sovereignty.\nSamori Toure of Mandinka\nSamori Toure (c 1828- June 2, 1900) was a Muslim religious figure and a military leader, who is referred to as the founder of the Islamic Empire known as the Was -\nsoulou Empire that was located in the present-day north and south eastern Guinea.The areas that were parts of the empire created by Samori Toure included the pres -\nent-day territories of Sierra Leone, Cot d’ Ivoire and Burkina Faso. Samori Toure strongly resisted the colonial rule of France in West Africa until the French defeated and captured him in 1898 . \nBy the year 1867, Samori became a commander of a relatively strong army having his base at a place called Sanankoro in the highlands of Guinea. Samori Toure worked hard to create a well-trained and properly armed army that could help to build a strong and stable empire. In order to strengthen his army, Samori used to import firearms via Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone since 1876. His military power en-abled him to control the gold mine district known as Bure. And this increased Samori Toure’s economic strength. In 1878, Samori Toure proclaimed himself the leader  of \nthe Wassoulou Empire he created. Samori Toure made the town of Bissandugu the capital of his empire. He soon established strong political and commercial relations with the neighboring Toucouleur Empire.

The French attempt to expand in West Africa in the late 1870s, brought them to direct \nconflict with Samori Touri. The French were expanding towards the territories oc-cupied by the Wassoulou Empire.  In early 1882,  the French forces launched attack \nagainst the forces of Samori Toure. His forces successfully repulsed the French at-tack and retained their possessions there. In this battle, Samori Toure was surprised by the military discipline and quality of firearms of the French troops he defeated. Toure wanted to have well trained; disciplined and properly armed troops like the French soldiers. In order to create an efficient modern army, Samori Touri sought Eu-ropean assistance. In January 1885 he sent his envoys to the British colonial rulers in Freetown, Sierra Leone, promising to place his empire under British protection. The British were not willing to confront with the French by accepting Samori’s request to put his Empire under their protectorate. Nevertheless, the British agreed to sell modern weapons to Samori Touri. \nThe French troops launched a military expedition in 1885 to control the Bure rich \ngold mines. The forces of Samori Touri, who were by then better armed, successfully resisted the French attack and launched a successful three directional counter-offen -\nsive and expelled the expanding French forces from Bure.

Although the forces of Samori had scored victories in some battles, they could not totally expel the French troops from their empire. In June 1892, the French troops defeated the forces of Samori Touri and captured the capital of the em -\npire, Bissangudu. To make matters even worse to Samori Touri, the British refused to sell firearms and ammunitions to Samori anymore. \nIn the last resort, Samori Touri formed an anti-colonial coalition with the neighbor-\ning Ashante Empire. Nevertheless, the alliance could not be fruitful as the British troops defeated the Ashante Empire in 1897. In the next year, i.e., 1898, Samori Touri lost almost all the territory of the empire he created to the French and was forced to retreat. Eventually, on 29 September 1898 Samori Touri surrendered to the French and was exiled to Gabon and died on 2 June 1990 in captivity.\nThe attempts made by the Africans to stop the European powers from colonizing \ntheir countries were not successful. It was partly because the African resistances against the European invaders were not well-organized. The Europeans had also a marked superiority in military training and quality of firearms. Sometimes the Eu-ropeans were able to mobilize the Africans against fellow Africans who were deter -\nmined to fight them. The only successful anti-colonial struggle in Africa was that of Ethiopia. Ethiopians under Emperor Menelik II had managed to defeat the Italians at the battle of Adwa in 1896 and Ethiopia became the only country in Africa whose independence was recognized by the colonial powers in the era of colonialism.\nActivity 2.3\n1.

The Ashanti, or Asante, were an ethnic sub-group of the Akan-speaking people and were composed of small chiefdoms.\nThe Ashanti established their state around Kumasi in the late 1600s, shortly after \ntheir first encounter with Europeans. In some ways, the Empire grew out of the wars and dislocations caused by the Europeans who sought to control the famous gold deposits which gave this region its name, the Gold Coast.

They made Ashanti a signifi -\ncant trading partner, providing wealth and weapons that allowed the small state to \ngrow stronger than its neighbors. In the 18th century Ashanti was simply one of the \nAkan-speaking Portuguese trading partners in the region.\nThat situation changed when Osei Tutu, the Asantehene (paramount chief) of Ashan -\nti from 1701 to 1717, and his priest, KomfoAnokye, unified the independent chief -\ndoms into the most powerful political and military state in the coastal region. The \nAsantehene organized the Asante Union, an alliance of Akan-speaking people who \nwere now loyal to his central authority. The Asantehene made Kumasi the capital of the new empire. He also created a constitution, reorganized and centralized the mil-itary, and created a new cultural festival, Odwira, which symbolized the new union. Most importantly, he created the Golden Stool, which he argued represented the an-cestors of all the Ashanti. Upon that throne, Osei Tutu legitimized his rule and that of the royal dynasty that followed him.\nGold was the major product of the Ashanti Empire. Osei Tutu made the gold mines \nroyal possessions. He also made gold dust the circulating currency in the empire. Gold dust was frequently accumulated by the citizens of Asante, particularly by the evolving wealthy merchant class. The Ashanti Empire’s economy depended on the gold trade in the 1700s, but by the early 1800s, it had become a major exporter of enslaved people. In exchange, the Ashanti received luxury items and some manufac-\ntured goods, including most importantly, firearms.\nThe consequence of this trade for the Ashanti and their neighbors was terrible. From \n1790 until 1896, the Ashanti Empire was in a continuous state of war. These wars led to the acquisition of more slaves for trade. The constant warfare also weakened the Empire against the British, who eventually became their main enemy. Between 1823 and 1873, the Ashanti Empire resisted British advance on their territory.  In 1874, however, British forces successfully invaded the Empire and briefly captured Kuma -\nsi. The Ashanti rebelled against British rule and the Empire was again conquered in \n1897. After another uprising in 1900, the British overthrew and exiled the Asante-hene and annexed the Empire into their Gold Coast colony in 1902.\nUrabi Pasha’s Rebellion in Egypt\nAhmed Urabi, or Urabi Pasha, was an officer in the Egyptian army.

Urabi and his supporters were arrested. And exiled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).\nThis revolt, also known as the Urabi revolt, was primarily inspired by his desire for \nsocial justice for the Egyptians based on equal standing before the law. With the sup -\nport of the peasants as well, he launched a broader effort to try to free Egypt and Sudan from foreign control and to end the absolutist regime of the Khedive Ismael Pasha. The revolt, then, spread to express resentment at the influence of foreigners, including the aristocracy of the Ottoman Empire.\nUrabi was eventually captured and tried by the restored Khedivate for rebellion on \nDecember 3, 1882. Urabi was found guilty and was sentenced to death, but the sen-\ntence was immediately commuted to banishment for life. He left Egypt on December 28, 1882, for Ceylon.

Five months later, Muhammad Ahmad passed away. The Mahaddists were also known as the Dervishes (religious beggars) and later as the Ansars (helpers).\nUpon the death of the Mahdi in 1885, Khalifa Abdullah took the leadership. He set \nup a strong administrative system by appointing district governors responsible for collecting taxation strictly in accordance with the rules of the Quran. The British re -\ngarded the successive victories of the Mahaddists as a threat and wanted to avenge the death of Charles Gordon. In 1896, the Anglo-Egyptian army, under the command of General Kitchner, advanced into the Sudan. Two years later, in 1898, this army in-flicted a final defeat upon the Mahadist forces at the battle of Omdurman. Sudan was occupied by the combined forces of Britain and Egypt. Following this, the British set up what they called the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium. Lord Kitchner was appointed as the first Governor-General of the Sudan.\nThe Maji-Maji Rebellion\nIn East Africa, the most serious challenge for the Germans was the widespread re -\nsistance of the people of Tanganyika. This rebellion broke out in the southern part of the colony, in the hinterland of Kilwa, in July 1905. It began in the Matumbi hills, following the imposition of heavy taxes and the use of forced labor in the cotton growing farma for export. The revolt spread rapidly throughout the region, with at -\ntacks on all foreigners: missionaries, administrators, and their Swahili/Arab clerks.\nIt was a spontaneous revolt with no previous planning or central leadership. And \nyet, the peoples of Southern Tanzania came together in a way that is unique in the history of African resistance to colonialism. Instinctively, they turned to their beliefs in the powers of the spirit world. It was a deliberate attempt to overcome the prob-lems that had crippled earlier African resistance to European conquest, i.e., a lack of African unity and the European machine-gun. They sprinkled their bodies with magic water known as Maji-Maji, which they believed would turn the bullets of their enemies into water. It is therefore from this term that the resistance movement got the name Maji-Maji. Although the revolt spread to Morogoro and the outskirts of Dar es Selam, it had gradually lost its initial momentum. The power of Maji-Maji had been weakened and its political unity was gradually falling apart because of ethnic and other differences.

They even perused a “scorched-earth” policy, destroying villages and laying waste vast stretches of southern and central Tanzania. Finally, they defeated the powerful Ngo-ni warriors in 1907. The war devastated several African villages and brought famine to the Africans. It also resulted in the destruction of trade and wealth in the country.\nIn any case, the Maji-Maji revolt demonstrated the possibility of broader African an -\nti-colonial nationalism. The sacrifice of the thousands of Tanzanians who died in the \nMaji-Maji revolt was important in inspiring the later generation of nationalists who brought their country to independence in the early 1960’s.\nLESSON 3\n2.3.

In 1922, Luggard published his book \ncalled “The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa.” He described the system of gov -\nernment he had worked out for the administration in Northern Nigeria. He recom-mended its application to all British tropical African colonies. “Indirect rule” was believed by the British to be the cheapest and most effective way of administering a vast population stretched over even vaster territories with the minimum of Europe-an personnel. But “indirect rule” was far from being a clear-cut system. Its applica -\ntion varied enormously from colony to colony."

To make this a reality, they empha -\nsized differences in dialects and redefined them as totally separate languages.  They described customary differences in dress, housing, and religious practices in terms of rigid “tribal” distinctions. Indeed, it has been argued that colonial authorities in-vented “tribalism.” By insisting on the strength of “tribal” differences and rivalries, colonists made it more difficult for Africans to achieve unity in opposition. The Brit-ish thus made use of the age-old imperial maxim: “divide and rule.”\nThe French Colonial Policy \nThe French believed that by teaching the colonial peoples the French language, sub-jecting them to French law, and giving them French civil and political rights, they could assimilate the people they colonized.\nThroughout their colonies in Africa, the French applied this theory in full only in \nSenegal. In 1848, France conferred French citizenship on the Senegalese and also gave them the right to elect a representative, called a deputy, to the French National Assembly (the lower house of the French parliament) in Paris. In accordance with the policy of assimilation, the Senegalese were given the French system of local gov -\nernment based on communes. All the indigenous inhabitants were French citizens and enjoyed the same civil and political rights as Frenchmen. People born in other parts of the French colonies could become French citizens only if they could read, write, and speak French well. \nAlbert Sarraut, Minister of Colonies in 1920–24 and 1932–33, was the individual \nwho laid the foundations for the French colonial policy of administration usually known as “Direct Rule.” Sarraut’s outlook was very different from that of the English-men. It was less respectful of African personalities while also being more fraternal toward Africans. Sarraut never talked about allowing the Africans to develop along their own lines. His dominant thought was that France and her African colonies must be kept as united in peace as they had been in war.\nThere were two major differences between the British and French methods of using"

The first was that the British tried as much as \npossible to ensure that all the chiefs they used were traditional rulers, as the French were not particularly keen on this point. The second was that the British were more inclined to respect the chiefs under them and to give them more powers than the French did. It was above all in education that French policy differed from the British. Although a few mission schools received government subsidies for exceptional effi -\nciency, nine-tenths of the formal education in French Africa was given by the state. All the teaching was in French. It is, however, noteworthy that, ultimately, the French and British methods virtually led to the same result. They caused African chiefs to lose their traditional character and made them dependent on their colonial masters.\nDuring the colonial period, Belgium had some colonial possessions in Africa. Belgian \nAfrican colonial possessions included Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi. Belgian colonial rule in the Congo was based on the idea of a “colonial trinity” in which interests of the state, missionaries and pirvate companies were all considered.\nPortuguese colonial rule in Africa, particularly in Angola and Mozambique, included \nboth oppressive and liberal methods. There was no clear landmarked policy to ad -\nminister the Portuguese colonies in Africa. We can say that the Portuguese colonial system of administration was more or less oppressive. In fact, there were few liberal policies like the assimilation policy. The assimilation policy was never fully imple -\nmented, but it kept native African peoples in Portuguese colonies hoping that one day they would behave and live like white Portuguese.\nGerman colonial rule in Africa from 1884-1914 was an expression of nationalism \nand moral superiority. The Germans pursued a colonial administrative policy of di-rect rule like the French to maximally exploit the resources of the people of Tangan -\nyika. The Germans employed direct rule, assigning enough personnel or manpower to administer their colonial possession of Tanganyika.\nThe Political Economy of Colonial Agriculture, Mining and Trade\nOne of the driving factors for the European conquest of Africa was economic motive. That was the need for raw materials for European industries and new markets for manufactured goods. Colonial governments often encouraged Africans to undertake cash crop production. A major role was filled in this process by African chiefs, wheth-er “traditional” or newly created. The chiefs were often given the task of establishing their own export plantations using unpaid force labor of their subjects. The most"

Ground nuts remained the main cash crop in Cote d’Ivoire, Angola, Tanganyika, Uganda and Eastern Belgian Congo. Cocoa was even more successful as a dominant cash crop in northern Nigeria and Senegal. Coffee was developed as a profitable cash crop and remained the principal export crop of the Gold Coast and southwestern Nigeria. Cotton, which was low-priced and labor-intensive, was usu-ally produced only under pressure from Europeans. To satisfy the demands of the French textile industry, peasant production of cotton was made compulsory in cer -\ntain parts of Ubangui Chari (Central Africa Republic), Upper Volta (Burkina Faso), Mali and Niger. In Southern Sudan, between the Blue Nile and White Nile, the British government sponsored a vast irrigation scheme to promote the peasant production of cotton.  African tenants, however, lost access to land for growing food and only \nreceived 40% of the profits from their cotton.\nMost of the African peasant farmers still graze most of their own basic food. Cheap \nrice from French Indo-China was imported into French West African colonies and sold at rates which undercut local food producers. African peasant farmers, who had often started the growth of cash crops for export under pressure from colonial taxa -\ntion, rapidly became dependent upon the imports which their crops might buy.\nIn general, during the 1920’s and 1930’s, African farmers were paid less for what \nthey produced, but had to pay more for what they bought. Thus, it was particularly the case after the “Great Depression,” which struck Europe and the United States in 1929-30. With failing real incomes and the constant pressure of colonial taxation, African peasants had to bring more and more land into cash-crop production. Food crops were neglected, the soil became exhausted, and in times of drought, famine struck. In 1931, famine killed nearly half the population in some areas of Niger.\nMining \nThe sector of the colonial economy most profitable for capital investment was min-ing. Colonial authorities assumed all rights over minerals within their territories. They were then leased to European-owned companies to exploit. The British thus took over the gold fields of Asante. The other major mineral resources which attract-ed European mining capital to West Africa were the ancient tin-mines of the Jos pla -\nteau region in northern Nigeria.

The settlement of white farmers along the Northern Rhodesia line of rail was to grow maize and cattle to feed the Katanga miners.\nSouthern Rhodesia was another important zone of European mining enterprises. \nBesides the coal of Hwange, which provided the copper belt (Katanga) mines with most of their industrial fuel, Southern Rhodesia became a major producer of gold, copper, and asbestos. The dominant industrial mining center of southern Africa was the Witwatersrand.\nActivity 2.4\n1. Discuss in groups the history of African resistance against colonial rule in any one \nof the African countries.\nUnit Summary\nThe suppression of the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade, the commodities of which were slaves, was a long process that took about half a century. The British were the first to take measures to bring an end to the “illegitimate trade”. The reason why the British decided to stop the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade has to do with the industrial revolu-tion. After the British embarked on the industrial revolution, they realized that the black people could help them much if the British remain in Africa and produce raw materials for the growing European industries. They also thought that Africa could be a potential market for European manufactured goods.\nThe European scramble for Africa began slowly in the 1870’s and reached its peak in \nthe late 1880’s and 1890’s. Between 1885 and 1900, European powers were racing against each other to control territories in Africa. The Berlin Conference of 1884–85 was an attempt made by the European leaders to add international agreement to the carving up of Africa that was already under way. It involved representatives from many European countries. The participants agreed to notify others of the areas they captured."

At the beginning of the \n19th century, there were intense regional feudal wars that could be an obstacle to the \nsmooth conduct of trade. Although the period was apparently unstable and unsafe for the smooth conduct of commercial activities, trade improved from time to time. This was probably because of the relative improvement of the political conditions along the Red Sea coast after the Egyptian conquest of South Arabia at the beginning of the 19\nth century. New political development along the Red Sea coasts and Arabia \nby the turn of the 19th century strengthened peace and order and increased the im-\nportance of the Red Sea as a very important channel of trade.\nTrade Routes and Market Centers \nActivity 3.1\n1. Make a group and guess the main export commodities of the long-distance trade. \nThen tell your list of trade items to other classmates.\nOne of the main caravan trade routes started from the Gibe region and led to As -\nsendabo in Guduru (Eastern Wollega). The Assendabo market was an important \nplace which served as a point of contact for people between the Abay and the Gibe River valleys. From Assendabo, the products of southwestern Ethiopia found their way to Basso in Gojjam. The Basso market, which is located immediately north of the Abay River, was a very important meeting place for merchants who came from dif -\nferent parts of Ethiopia. Muslim and Christian merchants from Tigray, Gondar, Wollo, Shewa and different parts of the present-day Oromia region south of the Abay River used to meet at the Basso marketplace.\nFrom Basso, one group of merchants proceeded to Derita in Begemder and then to \nGondar. At Gondar, the route was divided into two: one of the routes led to the Su -\ndan through Metemma; while the other went to Massawa via Adwa. From Basso, the merchants of Shewa also proceeded to Ankober, while the Wollo merchants went to Aussa and then to the ports of Tajura and Obock.\nBati and Ancharo were very important market centres in Wollo. Another major cara-\nvan route that originated from the Gibe region followed a north-eastern direction to the Soddo market in the Gurage land. The Soddo market was linked with the Anko-ber market in Shewa. With the emergence and consolidation of the Shewan Kingdom in the 19\nth century, the caravan route that linked the Shewan Plateau with Harar also \nrevived. Thus, Harari merchants began to visit Ankober frequently in the nineteenth"

Ethiopian goods were natural products which were obtained mainly from southwestern Ethiopia. Even today, most of the Ethiopian commodities for export are natural agricultural products."

The well known slave auction markets were Yejjube in Gojjam, and Abdul Rasul, near Aleyu Amba. In addition, cof-fee gradually came to assume considerable importance, particularly after rail trans -\nport in the twentieth century made it possible to transport the item in relatively large quantities.\nAs far as the merchants were concerned, although there were also some Christian \nmerchants, the majority were Muslim traaders from northern Ethiopia, known as Jabarti. These merchants traveled in large caravans, selecting one of them as their head, Negade Ras, a term which was later transformed into Negadras. Eventually, the Afkala who were the dominant Muslim merchants in southwestern Ethiopia came to dominate the local trade of the Gibe region. The Jabarti had a dominant role in the long-distance trade of the nineteenth century until they began to face competition from the Afkala. The Afkala had many connections along all the caravan routes from which they collected the important trade commodities. They had also better pro-tection from the local people and could easily and safely travel between the market places in the north and the Gibe region. Although the Jabarti still maintained their monopoly, by the middle of the nineteenth century, most of the caravan trade be -\ntween the south and northern Ethiopia was conducted by the Afkala.\nActivity 3.2\n1.

It was through the agency of Mus -\nlim merchants that Islam was introduced to the Gibe region in the first half of the nineteenth century. The introduction and spread of Islam helped the Oromo chiefs to establish monarchies and legitimize their power by neglecting the Gada system and other Oromo practices which were against hereditary rule or monarchy. Islam helped the rulers in southwestern Ethiopia to strengthen their state apparatus, rein -\nforce their authority, and facilitate the growth of trade. The long-distance trade cre -\nated strong links between the people of northern Ethiopia and south-western Ethio -\npia. Merchants from the north began to intermingle with people from south-western"

By then, the country was divided into \nseveral almost independent regional polities, which were themselves further divid-ed into smaller units. By then, the power of the so-called Solomonic kings had been thoroughly weakened. The Yejju Rases had dominated Ethiopian politics from 1769 to 1855. The Yejju rulers, who were also known as Worashe, were Amharized Oro-mos with a Muslim background. They took the title Ras Bitwoded, and most of them used Debre Tabor as their capital. Nevertheless, the Yejju Rases could not bring last -\ning peace and unity within Ethiopia. The period from 1769 to 1855, which is com-monly known as the Zemene Mesafint or the Era of Princes, was a time when not only the power of the Solomonic kings was thoroughly weakened, but it was also a period when the Ethiopian Orthodox Church was torn by religious doctrinal controversies.\nReligious Doctrinal Controversies \nChristianity was introduced in Ethiopia in the 4th century AD. The first and dominant \nChristian sect in Ethiopia was the Orthodox sect of Christianity. Nevertheless, there"

For instance, there was a dispute within the church between the House of Abba Ewostatewos and the House of Teklehaimanot. The disagreement was regard-ing the observance of Saturday as a Sabbath which was resolved by Emperor Zer -\nayacob in 1450 at the Council of Debre Metmaq which accepted both Saturday and Sunday as holyday. \nDuring the Zemene Mesafint there were controversies within the Ethiopian Ortho-\ndox Church on the birth of Christ. One group claimed that Jesus Christ had three births (Soset Ledet) while the other sect argued that Jesus Christ had only two births (Hulet Ledet). The second group was also known as Karra (knife, perhaps because its adherents are criticized for cutting the births of Jesus Christ down to two). Em-peror Yohannis IV gave state support for the Hulet Ledet (Karra) group. The Qebat (‘Unction’) doctrine had a strong support in Gojjam. The other doctrine, Ye Tsega Lej (‘Grace’) was dominant first in Gondar and then in Shewa. The Tewahedo (Union) doctrine, which was supported by the Egyptian Patriarch of Ethiopia, was dominant in much of Tigray and Lasta. As a result, such doctrinal divisions within the Ethiopian Orthodox Church had a regional character.  Thus, the doctrinal division prevented the Ethiopian Orthodox Church from playing its traditional role as a cohesive institu-tion among the Orthodox Christian masses.\nThe End of the Era of Prines or the Zemene Mesafint\nThe Zemene Mesafint was characterized by frequent civil wars among regional lords. The Ethiopian peasants were the principal victims of civil war. The peasants were forced to attend battles against their will. They were forced to hand over their pro -\nduce to the lords in their vicinity. Peasants had to pay numerousbi taxes to numer -\nous lords. They were also obliged to feed and take care of some soldiers that were assigned to them through the billeting system, as the soldiers were not salaried. Be -\ncause of the frequent wars, they could not conduct their agricultural activities peace-fully. In general, the impoverished peasants were almost completely exhausted by the perpetual feudal warfare that characterized the period of the Zemene Mesafint.\nNevertheless, the period of the Zemene Mesafint was not simply a time of the com-\nplete anarchy and collapse of the state power. It did see some periods of relative peace. During the long rule of Ras Gugsa, the Worashe hegemony gained a solid basis. In fact, during that period Shewa and Tigray were not fully under the Worashe hege -\nmony even during the tenure of Ras Gugsa. Moreover, the Yejju lords contributed to"

Their accounts also show some positive developments. Therefore, the period needs additional research. \nAs we have seen already during the Zemene Mesafint, the central government was \ngreatly weakened. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church also faced serious doctrinal di-visions. The country lacked peace and stability. The peasantry suffered more than any other section of Ethiopian society. In order to solve these problems and reunite the country, a young man named Kassa Hailu rose against the Worashe dynasty. In four major battles, the young Kassa defeated powerful regional lords of northern Ethiopia. In November 1852 Kassa defeated Dejach Goshu Zewde of Gojjam at the battle of Guramba. In April 1853, Dejach Kassa routed the vassals of Ras Ali Alula, including Dejach Birru Goshu and Dejach Birru Aligaz, at the battle of Gorgora Bi-chen. Then Kassa launched an attack against Ras Ali Alula, and defeated Ali at the battle of Ayshal on 29 June 1853. The battle of Ayshal was very significant as it put an end to the Worashe rule. The battle of Ayshal did not mark the end of the period of the Zemene Mesafint because there was still another powerful lord in northern Ethiopia particularly in Simen i.e., Dejach Wube Haile Mariam. Kassa Hailu had to remove the last obstacle to assuming power. Therefore, the forces of Kassa Hailu and Dejach Wube met at a place called Deresge in February 1855. Dejazmach Kassa Hailu defeated Dejach Wube and ascended to the throne as Tewodros II, King of Kings of Ethiopia. The battle of Deresge brought an end to the period of the Zemene Mesafint.  \nActivity 3.3\n1.Why did Dejach Kassa Hailu choose Emperor Tewodros II as his throne name?\n2.What makes Emperor Tewodros II different from his immediate predeces -\nsors?\n3.Why were Emperor Tewodros II’s reforms not warmly welcomed? \n4.How did the battle of Debarqi in 1848 shape the life of Emperor Tewodros?\nEmperor Tewodros II attempted to introduce several important reforms.

Tewodros quarrelled with the clergy and the patriarch, Abune Selema not because of religious reasons. What brought Emperor Tewodros and the Church into conflict was Tewodros’ attempt to confiscate the extra land hold-ings of the church to redistribute it among landless peasants. He also declared that each church should retain land that could maintain no more than two priests and three deacons. That brought him into conflict with the Orthodox clergy. As a result, Abune Selama excommunicated Tewoodros.

He appointed his own men in the regions he incorporated. Just a decade after Tewodros had assumed the imperial throne; most of the Ethiopian territories that were incorporated by him by force of arms had fallen under big regional lords including Tisso Gobeze of Wolkait, Dajach Kassa Mercha of Tigrai, Tedla Gualu of Gojjam, Wagshum Gobeze Gebremed-hin of Lasta and Negus Menelik of Shewa. \nEmperor Tewodros was aware of Ethiopia’s backwardness and made serious at-\ntempts to modernize Ethiopia, particularly because he wanted to build well trained, disciplined and well armed national army.

For this he wanted European assistance and wrote letters to Queen Victoria of England to send him skilled personnel. Unfortu -\nnately, Tewdros could not get a quick positive response from the British government for his request for British technical assistance.\nDisappointed by lack of response from the British government, Emperor Tewodros \nII took Captain Cameron, the British consul and European missionaries in Ethiopia as hostages and forced them to manufacture mortars in his gun-foundry established at Gafat near his capital, Debre Tabor.

Nevertheless, Tewodros was not willing to release the hostages. Therefore, in 1867, the British government sent a military expedition against Ethiopia led by General Robert Napier with a limited objective of releasing European captives. By 1867, the army of Emperor Tewodros had declined to 5,000 – 10,00 while the British force was composed of 32,000 – 40,000 men. In addition, the British had a marked superiority over the Ethiopian forces, both in military training and the quality of firearms. On the April 10, 1868 the British forces routed the Ethi-opian forces led by Fitawrari Gebreye at the battle of Arogee. In this battle, the right-hand man of Emperor Tewodros, Fitawrari Gebreye lost his life. The death of Fitaw -\nrari Gebreye was a big blow to Tewodros. The British eventually stormed Meqdela. General Napier demanded the unconditional surrender of Tewodros. But Tewodros was not willing to do so. Emperor Tewodros II first released all the European hos -\ntages and then commited sucide on April 13, 1868 at Meqdela rather than surrender to the British. The British soldiers looted Ethiopian treasury at Meqdela. The forces under General Robert Napier also took Prince Alemayehu Tewodros and his mother and wife of the late Emperor Tewodros i.e., Etege Tiruwork as captives and left Ethi-opia.  \nThe death of Emperor Tewodros again led to the usual power struggle among the \nleading regional lords.

That was because of the modern weapons Kassa Mircha received from General Napier for helping the British forces on their march to Meqdela to fidght against Tewodros. In 1872, Dejzmach Kassa Mircha declared himself Emperor Yohannis IV of Ethiopia and ruled from 1872 to 1889.\nAlthough Emperor Tewodros’ plan to create a united Ethiopia did not materialize, \nthere was no return to the Zemene Mesafint. The idea of Ethiopian unity was adopt-ed and implemented by the successors of Tewodros, including Yohannis IV, though with differing styles. Emperor Yohannis IV was politically liberal and followed an administration that resembled federalism. Yohannis was willing and ready to share power with his vassals. He granted a great deal of autonomy to regional and dynastic rulers. In this regard, in 1878, he forced Menilek of Shewa to drop his title of king of kings and confirmed his title of king of Shewa. Emperor Yohannis IV also designated Ras Adal Tesema of Gojjam as Negus of Gojjam and Kafa in 1881. Yohannis IV did not interfere in the internal affairs of his vassals as long as they recognized his over-lord-ship and paid tribute.\nActivity 3.5\n1.Make a group of four students and compare and contrast the unification at -\ntempts of Emperor Tewodros II with those of Emperor Yohannis IV.\nEmperor Yohannis IV devoted most of his time and energy to defending his country"

Although the Ethiopian forces were about to celebrate victory over the Mahadists, Yohannis was seriously wounded, and victo-ry turned into defeat.\nThe Shift of the Political Centre from the North to Shewa\nAlthough Emperor Yohannis IV had designated Ras Mengesha as his heir and suc -\ncessor, it was Negus Menilek of Shewa who formally inherited the throne from Em-peror Yohannis IV. As mentioned already, the pioneer of the modern Ethiopian state formation was Emperor Tewodros II. But Tewodros could not achieve his goals of national unification. Emperor Yohannis IV was somewhat successful in building an empire where regional hereditary rulers enjoyed the right of internal autonomy. Nevertheless, the process of the Ethiopian empire’s formation was not completed. Negus Menilek of Shewa, who crowned himself king of the kings of Ethiopia in 1889, learnt from the experiences and failures of his predecessors and made a great effort to complete the national unification process. During the reign of Emperor Menilek II, the size of the old Christian kingdom grew by more than double and, thanks to the remarkable victory the Ethiopians scored over the Italian forces at Adwa in 1896, Ethiopia got her first internationally recognized modern boundaries.\nThe main features of the reign of Emperor Menilek II included:\n1.Large scale territorial expansion.

Menilek also wanted to control the long-distance trade in southern and southwestern Ethiopia.\nMenilek’s territorial expansion had three phases. The first covered the period from \n1870 to 1889., The second stage was conducted between 1889 and 1896. The last stage of the expansion was carried out between 1896 and 1900. Negus Menilek of Shewa began his territorial expansion while he was the king of Shewa in the 1870s. The first to be incorporated by Negus Menilek of Shewa in the early 1870s were the Oromo clans of Shewa. Then the forces of Shewa got the peaceful submission of the Kistane Gurage people, who were predominantly Christians. The people of Southern Gurage gave the forces of King Menilek stiff resistance organized under their leader Hassan Enjamo who was from the people of Qebena. This area was subdued by the forces of Ras Gobena Dache only in 1888, after ten years of resistance.\nActivity 3.61. Who was Hassan Enjamo? What were his contributions?Southwestern Ethiopia, which is very rich in natural resources, was a bone of conten-\ntion between Negus Menilek of Shewa and Negus Tekle Haimanot of Gojjam. In fact, Emperor Yohannis IV had allowed Negus Tekle Haimanot of Gojjam to expand in that direction and stopped Menilek’s expansion in southwestern Ethiopia. Nevertheless, the two kings went to war, and in the subsequent battle fought at Embabo on 6 June 1882, the forces of Menilek defeated Haimanot’s forces. The Shewan victory over the forces of Gojjam at the battle of Embabo gave Negus Menilek the opportunity to expand towards southwestern Ethiopia. After the battle of Embabo, the local rulers of the kingdoms of southwestern Ethiopia, the five Oromo Kingdoms in the Gibe re-gion and the Leqa states in Wollega were persuaded to accept peaceful submission to the forces of Negus Menilek and incorporation into the Shewan kingdom. In return for their peaceful submission, Negus Menilek recognized the internal administra -\ntive autonomy of these kingdoms. King Aba Jifar of Jimma, Jote Tulu of Leqa Qellem and Kumsa Moreda of Leqa Neqamte belong to the list of local rulers who submitted peacefully to Menilek in the years between 1882 and 1884.\nThe campaigns of expansion of the forces of Negus Menilek in the southern and \nsoutheastern regions were not as strong as the resistance in Arsi, Wolaita and Kafa.

In some of these campaigns launched to incorporate Arsi, Negus Menilek himself personally took part. Finally, after four years of brave fighting, the Arsi Oromo were defeated in 1886 at the battle of Azule. The well-armed and militarily better experienced Shewan forces that finally defeated the forces of the Arsi Oromo were led by Ras Darge, the uncle of Menilek. In the Arsi campaign, the Oromo general Ras Gobena Dache who had a significant role in the early campaigns of Negus Menelik’s territorial expansion had taken part as a military commander of the forces of Negus Menelik. The Arsi campaign was one of the bloody campaigns that claimed the lives of many people. Unlike the rulers of southwestern Ethiopia, who peacefully submitted to the forces of Menilek, the rulers of the Arsi Oromo were not granted internal administration. They were removed from their positions and replaced by governors appointed by the Shewans.\nActivity 3.71. Why did Emperor Menilek conduct territorial expansion during the post-Adwa\nperiod?\n2. Discuss how Menilek treated the newly incorporated areas.\nArsi served as a stepping stone for Menilek’s expansion into the Emirate of Harar. \nThe Emirate of Harar was subdued by the forces of Shewa under Menilek after a bloody battle fought between the armies of Menilek and Emir Abdulahi at a place called Chelenqo on 6 January 1887. His success at the Chelenqo battle enabled Ne-gus Menelik of Shewa to control the eastern commercial town of Harar and gave him full control of the long-distance trade route. In the Chellenqo battle, not only the Harari forces but also the Oromo people fought against the forces of Shewa under Negus Menelik. Chelenqo, the main battleground of the war, is about 90 kilometers from Harar’s historic walled city. This victory brought an end to the independent existence of the Emirate of Harar. After the incorporation of Harar in 1887, Menilek did not launch campaigns of territorial expansion in any direction until the Wolaita campaign of 1894, mainly because of the Great Famine in Ethiopia which lasted from 1888 to 1892 and was known as Kefu Qen. The Kefu Qen had severely affected the country, particularly the northern and central regions of Ethiopia."

The campaign for the incorporation of Wolaita was probably the bloodiest of all the campaigns. In this campaign, Emperor Menelik personally participated. Many notable war leaders of Emperor Menelik such as Ras Michael, Fitawrari Gebeyehu, Liqe Meqwas Abate, Dejach Balcha, Ras Wolde Giorgis and Aba Jifar II had taken part in the Wolaita cam -\npaign.

Follow -\ning the incorporation, Menilek reinstated the loyal rulers to power as vassals. Those \nlocal rulers who submitted peacefully were allowed to stay as local rulers under Me-nilek. But those who resisted were dismissed from power and there was much land alienation.\nThe Nature of the North and South’s Land Tenure Systems\nNorthern and southern Ethiopia had different land tenure systems, especially after the 19th century. The traditional community system of land ownership has contin-ued in the north. Many provinces in Ethiopia’s northern regions, including Tigray, Begemder, Gojjam, Wollo, and Northern Shewa, had communal land ownership. Any -\none who could prove a blood connection to the landowner or the original possessor of the land, as well as the creator of the first settlement, had the right to claim the land. As a result, most of the land in northern Ethiopia was based on the rist system. Rist is the hereditary right to hold and use land. The land tenure also included the gult system, which is a right to collect tax. At the beginning, gult rights were not he -\nreditary. \nGabbar -Melkegna System  The gebbar system was the basic means of surplus appropriation of the feudal class. \nA gebbar was a land holding peasant who had to pay giber, or tribute, to the state. In many cases, tributes were paid in kind or by providing unpaid forced labor. Free labor service was given by the peasant and members of his family to the bale gult or Melkegna in times of grain production, construction, transportation, guarding pris-oners, and domestic services like grinding grain and fetching water and firewood for local chiefs. The gult owners not only kept a portion of the tax collected from their gult areas, but also got gifts and services, including unpaid labor. Gradually, gult rights became hereditary and the riste-gult system emerged. Gult land was given by the state to government officials. Gult owners could be either individuals or institu-tions, such as churches and monasteries. The gult owners were known as Melkegnas, and they represented the government in their gult areas. Therefore, they were influ-ential and powerful in their localities. \nChanging Dynamics of Land Tenure in the South \nMenilek’s expansion to the south, west and east brought significant changes. On the one hand, it eased the congestion in the rist lands of the north by providing new ar -"

In fact, the peacefully submitted areas to the forces of Menilek were free from the burden of the gebbar-melkegna system and thus man-aged to retain some degree of autonomy.\nIn the newly incorporated southern territories, peasants were gradually alienated \nfrom their land. This began with the introduction of the qelad system of land mea-surement. The institutionalization of the qelad system not only culminated in the appropriation of much land by the central government but also facilitated the privat-ization of land. It also increased the state revenue since it classified land tax based on the level of fertility of the land. The qelad system reduced the status of the peas -\nants of the newly incorporated areas from land-owing farmers to insecure tenants on their own land. Poor peasants who were unable to purchase land or those who were driven away from their land were forced to migrate to the urban centers in search of job.\nLESSON 4\n3.4.

That led to the British military expedition against Tewodros which ended with the stroming and plunder of Meqdela by the British army. After getting the release of European captives, the British forces withdrew from Ethiopia.\nThe Battles of Gundet and Gura\nIn 1875, Egypt’s ruler, Khedieve Ismael Pasha launched a war of aggression on Ethi-\nopia from three directions. In October 1875, one of these invading forces, led by Mo-hammed Rauf Pasha, occupied Harar. Another group led by Werner Muzinger, a Swiss mercenary who was the main architect of Egyptian aggression in Ethiopia, tried to enter Ethiopia through Tajura. But Muzinger and his army of about 500 men were ambushed and destroyed by the Afar people. Another well-armed Egyptian army un -\nder the command of a Danish colonel named Arendrup marched into the interior from the port of Massawa. In October 1875, his army had reached the Mereb River. In  October, Emperor Yohannis IV issued a mobilization order. In command of an estimated army of between 20,000 and 25,000, Yohannis crossed the Mereb River and and fought against the Egyptian army at the battle of Gundet on November 16, 1875. After two hours of effective attack on the encircled Egyptian troops, Ethiopi-ans scored complete victory. At the battle of Gundet, Colonel Arendrup and about 1,320 Egyptian troops were killed. Although the battle of Gundet was a humiliating defeat for the Egyptians, they did not withdraw from Ethiopian territory. Despite the defeat at the battle of Gundet, Khedieve Ismael prepared a second, larger expedi-tion against Ethiopia to avenge his earlier setback. In 1876, about 15,000 well-armed Egyptian troops under the command of Mohammed Ratib Pasha and an American officer, General Loring invaded Ethiopian territories in the north. The second battle was fought between March 7 and 9 March 1876 at a place called Gura, in what is now Akale Guzay in Eritrea. The Ethiopians also captured 2,500 Egyptian soldiers  and enormous weapons. \nBut Ethiopian victories at the battles of Gundet and Gura were not rewarding for \nEthiopians. The Egyptians remained in control of the Ethiopian territories they occu-\npied. The brilliant military victories in the two battles were not followed by a lasting peace treaty. Emperor Yohannis IV was neither able nor prepared to push the Egyp-tians out of either Massawa or Bogos. Defeat in the two gave Khedieve Ismail an im-portant lesson that he could not realize his dream of annexing Ethiopian territories"

The guns \nwhich Emperor Yohannis IV captured from the Egyptian invading troops helped him to establish his supremacy over the other Ethiopian regional lords.\nThe Hewett (Adwa) Treaty of 1884\nEmperor Yohannis IV and the British representative Admiral William Hewett signed a treaty in 1884 signed a treaty at Adwa. The agreement was known as the Hewett Treaty or the Adwa Treaty. In this treaty Yohannis IV agreed to facilitate the safe evacuation of the Egyptian troops trapped in eastern Sudan via Ethiopia. In return for this, the British, promised to ensure the return of Bogos to Ethiopia and make Massaw a free port for Ethiopia. Emperor Yohannis IV honored his words by allow -\ning the encircled Egyptian troops to be evacuated by sending his general Ras Alula Engeda (Alula Aba Nega). The British on the contrary failed to keep their promises and rather allowed Italy to occupy Massawa.   \nThe Dogali Incident \nIn 1885 Italy, with the help of the British, occupied Massawa and began to expand to the interior from the coast. The Italian attempt to control the Mereb Melash (Eritrea) was unacceptable both to Emperor Yohannis IV and his military commander, and to the governor of the Mereb Melash region, Ras Alula. Therefore, the Italians came into direct conflict with Emperor Yohannis and Ras Alula.\nOn 26 January 1887, Ras Alula, intercepted and destroyed an Italian army consisting \nof about 500 soldiers at a place called Dogali who were on their way to reinforce the Italian fortress at Saati. The Dogali incident was the first serious blow to the Italian colonial advance in Ethiopia. In other words, Dogali was the place where the Italians suffered their first defeat by the Ethiopian forces. The Italians condemned Alula’s attack on their troops at Dogali as an unjust attack and demanded an official apolo-gy from Emperor Yohannis IV. They also demanded that Italy be allowed to occupy Keren and the Assaurta and the Habab regions, in addition to reoccupying Saati and Wia, which they had evacuated following their defeat at Dogali. The Dogali incident created great anxiety and provoked an Italian desire for revenge. It equally offended the British government."

A British envoy, Gerald Portal, met Emperor Yohannis IV in November 1887 and proposed an official Ethiopian apology for Ras Alula’s at-tack on the Italians. This was totally unacceptable for Ethiopia. Yohannis declared his choice of war rather than accepting these proposed terms for “peace.” Therefore, the Portal mission failed, and Ethiopia began preparations for the inevitable war. Shortly afterwards, Emperor Yohannis called his people to arms. In March 1888, Yohannis mobilized a large army of 80,000 soldiers and marched to Saati, which had been re-occupied by the Italians. However, Yohannis returned without fighting because the Italians refused to come out of their fort and engage in an open fight. Yohannis did so partly because he felt insecure about his rear owing to the Mahadist incursions into Gondar and the collusion of his disobedient vassals, Negus Menilek of Shewa and Ne-gus Teklehaimanot of Gojjam, who were plotting against him. Returning from Saati, Yohannis waged a devastating punitive campaign against Gojjam. Then he went to Metemma to deal with the Mahadist threat.\nActivity 3.9\n1.

Mahadist soldiers ad-\nvanced from the west, slaughtering people, demolishing churches and monasteries, and setting fire to the city of Gondar. The Italians had already occupied Massawa, Wia and Seati in the Mereb Melash region. King Menilek of Shewa and TekleHaymanot of Gojjam, his two vassals in the south, were also disobeying and bothering him. Yohan -\nnis postponed his war with the Italians and returned to Debre Tabor in July 1888. He then marched to Gojjam, where he conducted a devastating punitive campaign. Tekle Haimanot submitted to the emperor peacefully. Yohannis then moved to Shewa to punish Menilek. Menilek was ready to resist, and it seemed as if a major civil war was about to break out.

On 9 March 1889, the Ethiopian forces under Emperor Yohannis and the Mahadist troops, or the Ansars, fought at the battle of Metemma. Despite their initial success, the Ethiopian forces lost the battle because Emperor Yohannis was fatally wounded, and his army retreated. Yohannis died the next day. The corpse of Yohannis was beheaded by the Ansars. This brought a climax to the Mahadist revenge, and they seemed to be satisfied. \nThe battle of Metemma had far-reaching consequences. Internally, it resulted in a dy -\nnastic shift of power from the Tigrean house to Shewa. Although Emperor Yohannis \nIV had designated Ras Mengesha as his heir and successor, Negus Menilek of Shewa was crowned Emperor Menilek II, King of Kings of Ethiopia. Secondly, the absence of strong defense in the north created a golden opportunity for the Italians, who man -\naged to easily advance further into the Mereb Melash region, which they proclaimed the Italian colony of Eritrea on the 1\nst of January 1890.\nReligious Division and Doctrinal Debates\nMost of the Ethiopian Christian monarchs believed that religious uniformity would bring about national unity. Emperor Yohannis IV, for instance, made an unsuccessful attempt to bring religious uniformity. He gave the Muslims two options at the Council of Borumeda in 1878: convert to Orthodox Christianity or loose their property and land. Some Wollo Muslims were baptized, while others decided to resist under their leaders like Sheikh Telha.  Two of the rival Muslim chiefs of Wollo, Imam Mohammed Ali and Imam Amede Liben (Abba Watew) were offered the choice between imme-diate baptism and loss of their position in Wollo.

Following his arrival Count Pietro Antonelli, signed a treaty with Menilek in 1883 providing for consul-ar exchange as well as freedom of trade and religion. In 1887, the two parties also signed a convention of neutrality in the confrontation between Emperor Yohannis IV and the Italians. Finally, Menilek and the Italians signed the controversial Treaty of Wuchale on May 2, 1889. Article 3 and Article 17 of the Wuchale Treaty are worthy of mentioning. While article 3 gave legal basis for the Italian colonization of Eritrea, the Italian version of Article 17 led to the battle of Adwa.\nArticle 17 of the Wuchale Treaty had different meanings in its Italian and Amhar-\nic versions. According to the Amharic version, “Menilek may (if he so desired) use the services of the Italian government in his dealings with foreign powers.” But the Italian version made it mandatory that “Menilek had to conduct all his foreign con -\ntacts via the Italian government.” The Italian version reduced Ethiopia to the status of an Italian protectorate. When Menilek wrote letters to England and Germany, he was told that he should write to them only through his protector, Italy. Now Menilek has come to realize that he was cheated by the Italians. Therefore, Emperor Menilek wrote his famous circular in 1891 to the European governments, officially proclaim -\ning Ethiopia’s position. Italy tried to persuade Menilek to accept the Italian version of Article 17 of the Wuchale Treaty. Moreover, the Italian governors of Eritrea pursued a policy of subverting his authority in Tigray. The Tigrean princes under Ras Menge-sha Yohannis expressed their solidarity with the Italians by swearing on 6 December 1891, an oath of alliance known as the Mereb Convention. In February 1893, Menilek unilaterally abrogated article 17 of the Wuchale Treaty. Empress Taytu had an in-strumental role in the abrogation of this article. Nevertheless, the Italian subversion of policy could not last long. In June 1894, Ras Mengesha and his followers came to Addis Ababa and submitted to Menilek II. To make matters even worse for the Ital-ians, a serious revolt broke out in Akale Guzay in 1894, led by Dejach Bahta Hagos. Disappointed by these setbacks, the Italians went ahead to realize their dream of conquering the whole of Ethiopia.\nAdwa, in fact, is a collective name given to a campaign that began in 1895 and ended"

The Adwa campaign had three phases: the \nbattle of Ambalage (7 December 1895), the siege of Mekelle (7–21 January) and the final battle of Adwa (1 March 1896).\nAt Ambalage, the Ethiopian forces led by Fitawrari Gebeyehu routed the Italian \ntroops. The Italians then fortified themselves at Mekelle, where Etege Taytu’s forces laid siege. The Italians were eventually forced to surrender as the Ethiopian forces under Etege Taytu had control of the stream from which the Italians used to fetch water. Surprisingly enough, Menilek allowed the surrendered Italian soldiers to go north and rejoin their compatriots. Finally, at Adwa, a fierce battle was fought, and the Ethiopians scored a major victory over the Italians on March 1, 1896. In the Adwa campaign, Ethiopians from every corner of the country took part and fought the com-mon enemy together, irrespective of their ethnic, religious, and political differences. Emperor Menelik II and his wife Etege Tayitu had personally participated in the cam -\npaign. Most of the distinguished military commanders of Ethiopia including those who had close ties and cooperation with the Italians, like Ras Mengesha Yohannes and Ras Alula Engda of Tigray and leaders of the newly incorporated territories had willingly and actively participated in the Adwa campaign. These included king Abba Jifar II of Jimma, Kawo Tona of Wolaita, Dejach Jote Tulu of Leqqa Qellem and and Dejach Gebre Egziabher of Leqqa Qellem who had mobilized their forces and accom-panied Emperor Menelik as far as Woreilu.

The defection from the Italian camp of their two Tigrian collaborators, Ras Sibhat Aregawi and Dajach Hagos Teferi in February 1896 enabled the Ethiopian side to acuire valuable information about the Italians. In contrast, the Italians were given wrong information about the Ethiopian forces.  \nThe number of Ethiopian forces who took part in the Adwa campaign was about \n100,000 of whom nearly three-quarters were armed with modern rifles. At the final battle of Adwa on 1 March 1896, the Ethiopian forces fought bravely and scored a resounding victory over the Italian troops. The Italians lost about 7,000 of their men; 2,500 were badly wounded, and 3,500 were captured as prisoners of war. \nAfter losing the battle, General Baratieri, the Italian governor of Eritrea, ordered a \ngeneral retreat. Of the three generals who led the Italian brigades at Adwa two of them i.e., General Arimondi and General Dabormida lost their lives while General Albertone was captured. The Italian dream of reducing Ethiopia to a colony ended in failure. Therefore, Italy was left only with control over Eritrea. Italy was forced to sign a peace treaty with Ethiopia on October 26, 1896 in Addis Ababa. The Addis Ababa Treaty declared the Treaty of Wuchale null and void.

Adwa also \ncontributed to the birth and development of black movements like Pan-Africanism, Ethiopianism, Rastafarianism, etc. Adwa was taken by the entire black race in Africa and elsewhere as a source of pride and dignity. The Africans and peoples of African origin learned that the whites were not invincible and that they could defeat the white colonizers and achieve independence following the Ethiopian model. In gener-al, Adwa gave a powerful impetus to the anti-colonial and anti-imperialist struggle of peoples who were under the yoke of colonialism.\nInternally, the victory of Adwa guaranteed the political independence of Ethiopia, \nalthough Eritrea remained under Italian control until 1941. Adwa enabled Ethiopia to be the sole independent African country whose independence was recognized by the colonial powers in the era of colonialism. Adwa forged Ethiopia’s own destiny, free from the colonial rule. This had a far-reaching impact on the political economy of Ethiopia and the psychology of the people. The Adwa victory showed Ethiopians that if they are united, they would be strong and invincible, and nothing would be impossible if the Ethiopians remained united. The Ethiopian people, even those who had grievances against Emperor Menilek II, were not reluctant to die for Ethiopia. The Ethiopian victory at Adwa also enabled Ethiopia to have an internationally rec -\nognized boundary. Accordingly, Emperor Menilek II signed several boundary treaties with the neighboring colonial powers. Ethiopia signed boundary delimitation agree-ments in March 1897 with French Somaliland (now Djibouti), with the Italian colony of Eritrea in July 1900, 1902 and 1908, with the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in May 1902, with British East Africa or Kenya in December 1907, and with Italian Somaliland in May 1908.

But the Wuchale Treaty was preceded by long years of Italo-Shewan friendship.\nAs mentioned above, the first official contact between Negus of Shewas and Italy \ngoes back to 1876 with the coming of the Antinori mission. In 1879, an Italian ship-ping company called Rubatino purchased Assab from the local Afar Sultan. In 1882, the Rubatino Shipping Company transferred Assab to the Italian government. While Menilek gave the Italian mission a resting place near Ankober called Let Marefya, the Italians assigned an agent to buy firearms for Menilek. This alliance was further strengthened by the Treaty of Commerce and Friendship, which was signed between Menilek and the Italian agent, Antonelli, in 1883. The next treaty between Menilek and Italians was signed in 1887. It was the Convention of Neutrality, in which Me-nilek agreed to remain neutral in the event of war between Emperor Yohannis IV and the Italians.\nMenilek sought to establish friendly relations with Italy to realize his ambition of \nassuming the Ethiopian Imperial throne. The Italians, too, wanted to forge strong ties with Menilek to achieve their ambition of colonizing Ethiopia. Negus Menilek was not in favor of the Italian desire to colonize Ethiopia. The Treaty of Wuchale was an extension of the friendship between Menilek and the Italians.\nArticle III of the Wuchale Treaty delimited the boundary between Italian-occupied \nterritories in the Mereb Melash region and the rest of Ethiopia. The villages of Ara -\nfaili, Segeneity, Asmara, and Adi Yohannis served as boundary lines for the Italian possessions. The territorial cessions of Emperor Menilek to the Italians were not satisfactory for the Italian colonial dream. The Italians began to push beyond the borders defined in Article III of the Wuchale Treaty. Moreover, the Italians cheated Ras Mekonnen, the cousin of Emperor Menilek, who went to Rome to get ratification of the whole treaty. They persuaded Ras Mekonnen to sign an additional convention"

It was also in that same year that the cousin and most probable successor of Emperor Menilek, Ras Mekonnen, passed away. Subsequently, the question of succession to the imperial throne became a very important issue. Again, it was in 1906 that Britain, France and Italy concluded the so-called Tripartite Treaty in an attempt to safeguard their territorial interests in the Horn of Africa in the case of succession strife in Ethi -\nopia after the death of Menilek, who had no officially designated heir and successor.\nAlthough the health condition of Emperor Menilek was deteriorating from time to \ntime, he took some measures to avert the possible political chaos in Ethiopia follow -\ning his death.

As Lej Iyasu was by then only 12 years old, Ras Tesema Nadew, the governor of Illubabor, was promoted to the rank of Ras Bitwoded and made the regent of Lej Iyasu.\nThe designation of Lej Iyasu as the legal successor of the Emperor was not welcomed \nby Etege Taytu, the influential wife of Menilek. Employing a skillful policy of mar-riage alliances, Taytu managed to strengthen her power and influence in Ethiopian politics. The most significant political marriage arranged by Etege Taytu was that of her nephew Ras Gugsa and Emperor Menilek’s daughter, Zewditu. Although Lej Iyasu was officially designated as the successor of Emperor Menilek in 1909, Etege Tay -\ntu continued to exercise supreme power. Taytu’s action provoked opposition from the Shewan nobility headed by Ras Bitwoded Tesema Nadew and Fitawrari Habte Giorgis Dinegde. Ras Mikael of Wollo, the father of Lej Iyasu also strongly protested against the illegitimate acts of Taytu. The nobility, who were victims of Taytu’s shum -\nsher (appointment and dismissal) also, joined the opposition against Taytu. Fitaw -\nrari Habte Giorgis Dinegde who had a key role in inciting the army known as Mehal Sefari against Taytu led the coup of 1910, which effectively removed Taytu from the imperial court. In 1910, Taytu was forced to leave the palace and retire to Entoto, where she died in 1918.\nLej Iyasu\nThe removal of EtegeTaytu from the palace in 1910 was followed by a reshuffling of political power in favor of the Shewan nobility. However, the regent of Lej Iyasu, Ras Bitwoded Tesema Nadew, died in April 1911. Unexpectedly, Lej Iyasu refused to ac-cept a new regent. The sudden death of Ras Bitwoded Tesema gave the teenager Lej Iyasu the opportunity to exercise political authority on his own, although he was not officially crowned even after the death of Menelik in 1913. Anyway, Lej Iyasu exer-cised full political power from 1911 to 1916. The only serious challenge to Lej Iyasu’s assumption of power came from Ras Abate Buayalew. Abate seems to have a plan to be the next regent following the death of Ras Bitwoded Tesema Nadew. Ras Abate re-portedly made an unsuccessful attempt to break into the palace. Finally, the possible bloodshed was avoided by the intervention of the patriarch, Abune Mathewos.\nLej Iyasu was too young and without the required experience to rule a big empire \nlike Ethiopia.

He also tried to do away with the unfair traditional practice of thief detection, called Leba Shay.\nIyasu’s period became very controversial because of his religious policy. His religious \npolicy was eventually used by his internal and foreign adversaries to remove him from power. What Lej Iyasu tried to do regarding religion could be briefly explained as an attempt to introduce an equitable system whereby both Christians and Mus -\nlims would live as equal citizens. Iyasu was not providing special attention and favor to Islam over Christianity as his opponents were blaming him. He continued building churches and giving endowments to churches and monasteries as his predecessors were doing. Lej Iyasu also felt that similar encouragement should be given to Islam and Muslim religious institutions.\nIn fact, Lej Iyasu had built a polygamous family, continued his adultery, and showed \ndisrespect and contempt for the old and apparently corrupt nobility. He was often absent from his capital, Addis Ababa, owing to his frequent wanderings to the prov -\ninces.

Haile Giorgis was also given the rank of Chairman of the Council of Ministers, which had been held by Fitawrari Habte Giorgis Dinegde. Moreover, Lej Iyasu removed Dejach Teferi Mekonnen from his family fief, Harar and transferred him to Kafa. The combination of all these ac-tions disappointed the Shewan nobility and encouraged them to unite to remove Lej Iyasu from power.\nLej Iyasu also antagonized the neighboring colonial powers of Italy, France and Brit -\nain by following a pro-German and pro-Turkish policy. This was viewed with great alarm by them because, at that time, they were engaged in the First World War, against Germany and Turkey. Iyasu was also providing material and moral support to the Somali nationalist leader, Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassen who was fight-ing against British and Italian colonizers in Somalia. As a result the three colonial powers allied with the Ethiopian internal forces against Lej Iyasu.  Britain, France and Italy sent a joint note to the Shewan nobility asking for the removal of  Lej Iyasu in September 1916. The Mehal Sefari too, stood against Lej Iyasu.\nWhile Lej Iyasu was on his usual tour of the Ogden, his opponents assembled in Ad -\ndis Ababa and convinced Abune Mathewos, to excommunicate him. The coup against \nIyasu was approved by both the Abun and the Echege. On September 27, 1916, Lej Iyasu was deposed.

Italian colonial interest in Ethi-\nopia gathered a new momentum after the coming to power in Italy of Benito Mus -\nsolini and his Fascist Party in 1922. Above everything, the Italian Fascists and their supporters wanted to restore the former glory of the Ancient Roman empire by eras -\ning this shameful scar on their history.  On October 3, 1935, Italian troops crossed the Mereb River that separated Ethiopia and the Italian Colony of Eritrea. On 8 Novem-ber, the Italians entered Mekelle. After an initial tactical retreat, the Ethiopian forces tried to check the Italian advance in January 1936. Ras Kassa Hailu was assigned by Emperor Haile Selassie as the overall commander of the northern front. Ethiopian forces in the north were commanded by Ras Emeru Haile Selassie, (Shire front), Ras Mulugeta Yegezu, (Enderta front), Ras Kassa Hailu and Ras Seyoum Mengesha (Tem-ben front).  The major weakness of the Ethiopian side was a lack of coordination. The forces of Ras Kassa and Ras Seyoum fought two major battles in Tembien (the first in January and the second in February 1936). Although ultimately unable to check the advance of the Italians, the Ethiopian forces fought with zeal and dedication. The forces of Ras Emeru in the Shere front in the west had also registered some success, ambushing and destroying a force of Italian ascari (colonial troops) at a place called Endabaguna. The Ethiopian forces under the War Minister Ras Mulugeta were, how -\never, routed by the Italian forces at the Battle of Amba Aradom, near Mekelle.\nThe final battle on the northern front was fought at Maychew on 31 March 1936. The \nEthiopian forces in this battle were commanded by Emperor Haile Selassie I. The emperor mobilized what was left of the northern front and the Imperial Bodyguard. The Italians fought from well-fortified positions and had a marked superiority in the air. Despite some initial success, the Ethiopian forces were eventually defeated. The defeat was followed by merciless aerial bombardment of the retreating Ethiopian troops.

Badoglio was assigned as the first Italian viceroy of Ethiopia. But soon, Marshal Badoglio was replaced by Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, who served as viceroy until an assassination attempt was made by Moges Asgedom and Abraha Deboch to kill him on 19 February 1937. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians in and around Addis Ababa were mer-cilessly massacred by the forces of Graziani. Soon after the Addis Ababa massacre, Graziani was replaced by the more liberal minded viceroy, the Duke of Aosta, who remained in that position until the final defeat and expulsion of the Italians in 1941."

The resistance could be divided into two phases. The first could be described as a continuation of the 1935–36 Italo-Ethiopian War. This phase was characterized by conventional fighting. The February massacre of 1937 marked the beginning of the second phase which was characterized by guerilla warfare."

The February 1937 massacre was a signal for a reign of terror unleashed by the Fascist Black Shirts. Special targets of the Fascist terror were educated Ethiopians. The Ethiopian Orthodox clergy also became one of the major victims of the fascist aggression. Many churches and monasteries were burned by the Italians. Mussolini had ordered the execution of all monks without distinction.

Do you support or oppose the attempt of Abrha Debotch and MogesAsgedom to\nkill Graziani? Are they heroes or troublemakers? Why?\nAlthough the patriotic resistance was particularly strong in Gojjam, Begemder and \nShewa, there was no part of Ethiopia where the Italians ruled without problems. The guerilla struggle included almost all provinces in Ethiopia. Ethiopians, irrespective of ethnic and religious differences, fought the invading forces until 1941. In fact, there were also Ethiopians who were willing to assisst the Italians against their mother -\nland, Ethiopia. Those Ethiopians who did the dirty work for the Italians were known as banda. The bandas created more problems for the patriots than the Italians them -\nselves. The Italians were able to identify nobles who had discontents against Emper -\nor Haile Selassie I and attracted them to their side and made them became banda. The main collaborator of the Italians was Ras Hailu Teklehaimanot of Gojjam. Others who joined the Italian camp, at least for a while, included Ras Seyoum Mengesha of Tigray, Ras Getachew Abate of Shewa, Dejach Ayalew Birru of Semen and Aba Jobir of Jimma. Dejach Haile Selassie Gugsa of Tigray had already deserted to the Italian at the beginning of the Italian invasion and provided them with vital intelligence about Ethiopian military positions.\nDespite such collaborations, the patriotic resistance gradually weakened the Italian \noccupation. The outbreak of the Second World War and Italy’s entry into World War II on the side of Germany in June 1940 ended Ethiopia’s international isolation. Now the British have decided to provide military help to Emperor Haile Selassie and the Ethiopian patriots.

They crossed the Ethiopian boundary at Omedla, in Gojjam. Another British force led by William Platt defeated the Italian forces in Eritrea and entered Asmara in April 1941. Finally, the British forces from Kenya, led by General Allen Cunningham, defeated the Italians, and liberated Adddis Ababa on April 6, 1941. On May 5, 1941, Emperor Haile Selassie returned to Addis Ababa.\nWomen Patriots \nAlthough most of the patriot leaders were men, there were also women who became the rallying point of the resistance movement. In this regard, we can mention two female figures: Kebedech Seyoum, daughter of Ras Seyoum and wife of the late Abera Kassa, Shewanesh Abrha, wife of the beheaded Dejach Hailu Kebede of Wag, Lekye-lesh Beyan, and Senedu Gebru. Women played a key role in the resistance struggle of 1936 - 41. They collected wood, fetched water, prepared food for the combatants, and took care of the wounded. They also encouraged brave fighters and insulted those who were reluctant to fight. Some women directly took part in fighting and were engaged in actual combat. Some Ethiopian women also worked as Inner Patri-ots (West Arbegnoch). The Inner Patriots were officially within the Italian camp but helped the patriots secretly by providing them with information, provisions, arms, ammunition, and medicine. Among the outstanding female Inner Patriots, we can mention Woyzero Shewareged Gedle of Shewa and Woyzero Shewanesh Abebe of Gondar. Shewareged played an important role in the patriotic attack on the Italian garrison in Addis Alem, 60 kilometers west of Addis Ababa. Woyzero Shewanesh Abebe, who had a good command of the Italian language, used to provide valuable information about the Italians."

In 1879, therefore, Bismarck made a Dual Alliance be-tween Germany and Austro-Hungary. The Alliance committed each partner to sup -\nport the other if attacked by Russia. This Dual Alliance became the cornerstone of German foreign policy up to World War I. In 1882, the Dual Alliance was expanded into a Triple Alliance, uniting Germany, Austro-Hungary, and Italy.\nMap 4.1 Europe and the Alliance systems, 1914\nIn 1890, after Bismarck’s departure, Germany refused to renew the 1887 treaty be-tween Russia and herself, though Russia wanted to renew it.

Thus, Russia turned to France to escape isolation, and the Franco-Russian alliance was estab -\nlished between 1891 and 1894. Moreover, in 1902, Britain made an alliance with Japan, which strengthened Britain’s position in East Asia and allowed Britain to con -\ncentrate more on Europe.

This ac-tion caused Japan to declare war against the Allied Powers. Therefore, World War I broke out between the two armed camps, i.e., the Triple Alliance (Central Powers) and the Triple Entente (Allied Powers).\nThe main theater of World War I was Europe. The theaters of the war were also \nfought far from Europe, including Africa and the Pacific Ocean. In Europe, the war was fought on two major fronts: the Western Front (Germany against the Allied Pow -\ners) and the Eastern Front (Germany against Russia).\nOf the two fronts, the most important was the Western Front, where Germany put \ninto practice the Schlieffen Plan. This war plan was designed by Von Schlieffen, who had been Chief of Staff of the German Army. The Schilieffen plan required an attack on France first by sweeping through Belgium. In the east, the Germans planned to stand on the defensive against Russia until France had been crushed, a task Germany planned to complete in six weeks. Thus, the Germans invaded Luxemburg on August 1 and Belgium on August 3. The latter invasion violated the treaty of 1839, in which the British had guaranteed Belgian neutrality. This factor caused Britain to abandon neutrality and to join the war against Germany. Germany then invaded France, and on August 4, 1914, Britain declared war on Germany.\nMap 4.2 WWI and the Schlieffen Plan"

In the Far East, Japan honored its alliance with Brit-ain and entered the war. The Japanese quickly overran the German colonies in China and the Pacific.\nMuch of the First World War’s combat involved trench warfare, where hundreds of-\nten died for each meter of land gained.

The peace negotiations were held in Paris in the pe -\nriod between 1919 and 1920, and the final treaties were signed at different palaces near Paris. It is from these palaces that the treaties took their names.\nThe peace settlement, particularly in Europe, was determined by the “big four”: \nPresident Wilson (USA), Prime Minister Clemenceau (France), Prime Minister Lloyd George (United Kingdom) and Orlando (Italy). In fact, the peace conference was re -\nally dominated by the “Big Three”: Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George. The Mid -\ndle East settlement, however, was largely determined by Britain and France because Wilson returned to the USA and fell sick.\nThe Treaty of Versailles \nOf these peace treaties, the most important one that formally ended the war between the two sides was the Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919, in the Hall of Mir-rors at the Palace of Versailles near Paris. The United States did not ratify the agree-ment but signed a separate Treaty of Berlin with Germany on July 2, 1921.\nThe Versailles Peace Treaty made the following territorial arrangements in Europe: \nGermany ceded Alsace and Lorraine to France; the border districts of Eupen, Malm-edy, and Moresnet were ceded by Germany to Belgium. After Plebiscite, Northern Schleswig was restored to Denmark (it had been annexed in 1866 by Prussia); and Germany lost territory in the East to Poland. As a result, the German province of East Prussia was divided from the rest of Germany by the so-called “Polish Corridor,” Po -\nland’s access to the sea. Moreover, the small districts of Hulchin (Hlucin) were ceded by Germany to Czechoslovakia, as its inhabitants were Slav, not German; the entirely German city of Danzig was made a “free city” under the League of Nations and de-tached from Germany; the port and district of Memel were detached from Germany."

In general, Germany lost 13% of its territory, 48% of its iron ore, 10% of its coal, and 15% of its agricultural production.

Hence, Germany lost all her colonies, which were shared among the Allies. Germany’s pacific and far eastern colonies, namely the Caroline, Marshall, and Marianas Islands, were given to Japan.\nGermany’s regular army was limited to 100,000 men, and conscription was forbid -\nden. Her navy was severely limited in its numbers and size of ships. Germany was not allowed to possess military aircraft, tanks, heavy artillery, or submarines. Al -\nlied commissions were to carry out inspections to ensure that these provisions were carried out. The Rhineland, German territory on the West bank of the Rhine and 50 km inwards along the East bank, was demilitarized. Germany should pay repara -\ntions. Germany accepted a responsibility to pay financial compensation (reparation) for the loss and damage caused by German military during the war on Allied civil -\nian property. The total bill was finally fixed by an Allied Reparations Commission in 1921 at 132 billion gold marks, or $6,600 million.\nTo conclude, the Versailles Treaty was not negotiated between the Allies and Ger -\nmany but was drafted by the Allies and imposed on the German government with \nlittle opportunity to make objections. The Germans called Versailles the “Diktat” (the dictated peace) and the “Slave Treaty.” The Treaty of Versailles made excellent propa-ganda for Hitler and the Nazis to exploit in their rise to power in Germany.\nActivity 4.5\n1.Do you agree with the above argument that more lenient peace terms mightprevent the Nazis from coming to power?

The League of Nations was formally established in January 1920 as the world’s first international organization with the responsibility of keeping world peace. Its primary goal was to prevent wars through collective security and disarmament, as well as to serve as a forum in which nations could settle their disputes through peaceful means such as conciliation, arbitration, and judicial procedures.\nThe US President Woodrow Wilson was the leading architect of the foundation of \nthe League of Nations. But Wilson was unable to get the approval of the US Senate on America’s membership in the League. As a result, USA was not a member state of the League. Germany was also not allowed to join the League until 1926. Russia was also not a member of the League until 1934. In 1935, the League’s membership rose to 58 states. The League’s headquarter was in Geneva, Switzerland. The League was dominated by the victorious allies of WWI, namely Britain, France and Italy.\nThe League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis Pow -\ners in the 1930s. The League’s powers were limited to persuasion and various levels of moral and economic sanctions that the members were free to carry out as they saw fit. This was mainly because the League lacked its own armed forces to enforce its resolutions. The credibility of the organization was seriously weakened after it failed to stop Japanese aggression in Manchuria in 1931 and the Fascist Italian ag-gression in Ethiopia in 1935.

The Revolution had two distinct phases. The first one was the Febru-ary Revolution of 1917, which ended the autocracy of Tsar Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia. The second phase was the October Revolution, in which the Soviets, led by Vladimir Lenin’s Bolshevik party, seized power from the Provisional Government. \nCauses of the Russian Revolution \nThe causes of the Russian revolution were Russia’s political, social, and economic problems. Politically, the people of Russia resented the dictatorship of Tsar Nicholas II. The losses that the Russians suffered during World War I further undermined themonarchy. Socially, the despotic Tsarist regime had oppressed the peasant class forcenturies. This caused unrest in rural areas. Economically, widespread inflation andfamine in Russia contributed to the revolution. All these led to the Russian Revolu -\ntion.\nFigure 4.2 Vladimir Lenin"

He believed that there should be no support for the provisional government and the war and Russia should prepare for a socialist revolution. Lenin raised the slogan, “ All powers to the soviet!”\nFrom April to October 1917, the situation in Russia was favorable for revolution. The \nBolsheviks party gained increasing support from the masses. The Bolshevik slogan “Peace! Bread! Land! “ All power to the Soviets!” gained strong support. In October 1917, in a secret party meeting Lenin called for an insurrection to take power. On On October 25, 1917, Lenin led the Bolsheviks in a nearly bloodless revolt against the ineffective Provisional Government. The October Revolution was based upon the ideas of Karl Marx. It marked the beginning of the spread of communism in the twen-tieth century. The Bolsheviks established a government called the Soviet Council of People’s Commissars headed by Lenin and Trotsky as commissars of the Red Army and Minister of Foreign Affairs, with other Bolsheviks taking the other positions in the new Socialist government.\nThe Bolsheviks knew that Russia and the Russian army wanted peace very quickly. \nTherefore, immediately after the October Revolution, the new Bolshevik government proposed peace. In the treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, Russia made a sepa-rate peace with the central powers. Germany dictated the terms of this treaty.

The Great Depression was a massive global economic recession (or “depression”) be -\ntween 1929 and 1933. It led to massive bank failures, high unemployment, inflation, as well as dramatic drops in GDP , industrial production, and stock market share pric -\nes. \nThe cause of the Great Depression was mainly due to the collapse of international \ntrade as a result of restrictive trade practices globally. Many nations experienced a decline, though the severity and timing differed from country to country.\nActivity 4.11\n1. Which view on the causes of the Great Depression? Discuss it with your friends.\nThe world depression of 1929–33 was the worst depression recorded in history. The \ndepression hit non-industrial countries more harshly in one way than industrialized \ncountries since the price of raw materials and food stuffs failed more sharply than the price of manufactured goods. The World Depression was an economic and political turning point in the inter-war period. The political effects of the depression were disastrous internationally. The depression helped the militarists to take power in Japan and was a major factor in enabling Hitler and the Nazis to take power in Ger-many in January 1933. The world was then again on the road to war."

The New Deal, which had a diversified \nprogram, was the work of F.D. Roosevelt, the American president. Its programs sought to stimulate the economy by creating regulations which would raise the wages of ordinary workers and by redistributing wealth so that more people could purchase products.\nFascism\nBrainstorming Questions\n»What are the main characteristics of Fascism?\n»How did the Fascists take power in Italy and Germany?\nThe name “fascism” comes from the Latin word “fasces.” The fasces were the rods \nand axes bound together, which were carried in front of the consuls of the ancient Roman Republic as a symbol of authority. Mussolini adopted the symbol of the fasces and the name fascism, with the power and glory of ancient Rome. Moreover, the fas -\nces were symbols of authority, and Fascism was an authoritarian movement.\nInitially, Fascism attracted the petty-bourgeois groups such as shopkeepers, entre-\npreneurs, and low-salaried employees. According to some writers, the First World War was the catalyst for the rise of Fascism. The war produced a climate of post-war dissatisfaction and unrest of social and economic dislocation full of fears and uncer-tainties with the old system. Post-war social, psychological and economic difficulties \ngave rise to Fascism. There were many unemployed people who were particularly \nopen to the appeal of Fascism. At any rate, Hitler called his party National Socialist because he aimed to attract the masses. But the Nazi party was not Socialist in any way, but Hitler states in his book, “Mein Kampf” (My Struggle) that he aimed to at -\ntract “workers.”\nFascism also appealed to the youth.

Another special \ngroup whom Fascism appealed to were ex-soliders and ex-officers, many of whom had never known any other occupation and who did not know what to do after the war. They sometimes felt, too, that the government in power had betrayed them in the pace settlement. Also, in Fascism, the ex-soldiers found the sense of comradeship and solidarity they had known in the war. Fascism also appealed to some intellectu -\nals, especially young intellectuals, who were dissatisfied with the post-war situation. The post-war crisis led many young intellectuals to join either Marxism or Fascism. Finally, Fascism attracted gangsters who found its ideology easier to assimilate than Marxism. Fascism was aggressive and violent, and what drew its supporters together were, to a large extent, their fears and hatred. \nFascism stood for extreme, aggressive nationalism. “If the nation is strong, it can and \nwill take what it needs at the expense of others. This is the “law of nature,” said Fas -\ncists. The Fascists therefore glorified strength and the military virtues. They believed that natural law entails the survival of the fittest among nations. Sometimes Fascists glorified war for its own sake, not just as a means of attaining concrete national ob-jectives. Fascism stressed the supreme importance of great men and the role of the national leader. But once in power, his authority is supreme. The leader was elected but had to enjoy unconditional authority. All means of communication also come un-der state control: the press, film, the theatre, books, and radio. They were effectively used for propaganda by both Mussolini and Hitler.  Fascism tends towards racism, the belief that certain ethnic groups are superior in intelligence, creativity, moral will, power, etc. Race is the key to Hitler’s entire political philosophy. He believed that the highest race of all is the Aryan race. The Fascists say that the Aryan blood of the Germans is threatened by racial mixture with lower races. For Hitler, the most degen -\nerate race of all was that of the Jewish people. Hitler said that the Jews in Germany must be driven out or liquidated.\nThe Rise of Fascism in Italy\nA person who is very much associated with Italian Fascism is Benito Mussolini. Mus-solini had first been a socialist journalist who advocated the overthrow of capitalism. When World War I began, he urged Italy to join the war on the side of the Allies. After the war, his socialist views began to change, and he wrote about Italy’s need to be -\ncome a great nation. In 1919, he organized the Fascist party. As the symbol of their"

The Fascists soon got the support of the majority because they promised jobs to the unemployed, land to the peasants and protection from communism to business owners. In Octo -\nber 1922, the Fascists wearing their usual black shirts began a march on Rome. King Victor Emmanuel III feared using armed force to stop the march. So, he appointed Mussolini as Prime Minister. With this, the Fascists took power in Italy.\nThe Nazi Took Power in Germany\nThe aftermath of World War I created the conditions for the success of the Nazi party \nin Germany. Some of them were: German national pride had been severely harmed. The Versailles Treaty was unpopular in Germany. The allies imposed a restriction on Germany’s military force. Germany was in severe economic distress. Inflation made life very difficult in Germany in 1920, which was later followed by the Great Depres-sion.  There was political discontent against the existing government of the Weimar Republic. The government was unpopular and accused of betrayal after it had signed the hated Versailles treaty. The above-mentioned situation helped the National So-cialist Party, commonly known in its short form as “Nazis,” and its leader, Adolf Hitler, come to power in 1933.\nFigure 4.3 Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini\nIn 1923, the Nazi party attempted to overthrow the Weimer Republic.

There was indeed a Spanish fascist party that was founded in 1932.  In the civil war, Franco received support from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. However, Franco was not a fascist.

He had a mass popular movement behind him like the movements in Italy and Germany, but Franco’s regime cannot be defined as Fascist.\nThe Japanese regime of the 1930s is sometimes described as “Fascist.” There are \nsome similarities between Japan and European Fascism: authoritarianism, racism (the Japanese militarists, like the Nazis, believed that they were a “master race” with the right to dominate “inferior” races).

In the 1930s, however, such attempts failed because of the rise of dictators. In 1934, Germany started to rearm in violation of the Versailles Treaty. A year later, Japan began to rebuild its naval force in violation of the Washington Agreement of 1922. In 1936, Hitler and Mussolini made an axis, or an alliance. In an alliance known as the Rome-Berlin Axis, they agreed to help one another in their drive for power and conquest. The Tripartite Pact was signed between Germany, Italy, and Japan (the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis) on 27 September 1940, formalizing their alignment as the “ Axis Powers.”\nActivity 4.15.\n1.Why Germany, Italy and Japan formed a united military front?\nIn 1931, Japan took over Manchuria. The League of Nations took no other action than \ncondemnation. Japan didn’t accept and left the League in 1933. Having observed the failure of the League, Hitler began to violate international law. In October 1933, he withdrew Germany from the League of Nations. In 1936, he militarized the Rhineland, which was supposed to be a buffer zone between Germany and France. In 1938, Hitler sent his troops into Austria. This was in violation of the Versailles Peace Treaty. Fascist Italy also felt that it should control new territory as soon as possible. In 1935, Mussoli-ni invaded Ethiopia. The League of Nations failed to stop Mussolini’s \naggression.LESSON 4\n4.4. World War II"

They didn’t resist Hitler’s action. The policy of making political and territorial concessions to Hitler in the hope of satisfying him instead of resisting him was the policy that became known as appeasement. Britain and France followed an appeasement policy until September 1939. They followed this policy because they were not ready for war and did not want to go to war. Their economic crisis due to the Depression also discouraged entry into another war. The USA also turned its back on Europe’s political problems to avoid being involved in another war.\nSoon after he occupied the Rhineland and Austria, Hitler announced that he demand -\ned the Sudetenland which was part of Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia began to pre-\npare itself for war. In 1935, Britain, France, and the USSR had agreed by treaty to help Czechoslovakia. In 1938, Prime-Minister Neville Chamberlain of Britain, Premier Ed-ward Daladier of France, Mussolini of Italy, and Hitler of Germany met in Munich. At this conference Hitler’s demand was supported, and he was allowed to annex the Sudetenland. In 1938, the Sudetenland became part of Germany. In the same year, Hitler broke his promise and took most of the rest of Czechoslovakia. Similarly, Italy occupied Albania in April 1939. Then, Britain and France realized that the interests of dictators were unlimited and they wanted an alliance with the USSR.\nFinally, World War II broke out on September 1, 1939, when Hitler invaded Poland.  \nHe believed that England and France would not resist him, but he was wrong.

In their invasion of Poland, the Germans employed a new and effective war method of fighting known as “blitzkrieg”, meaning “lightning war”. The key principle in this war strategy was to win a quick and deci -\nsive victory through the coordinated attacks of the German air force and fast-moving ground forces. Finally, the last Polish Army unit was defeated on October 6. At first, Germany and its allies took the upper hand in the course of the war. This was be -\ncause of their long preparation and their war strategy of blitzkrieg. Hence, Germany and its allies quickly conquered most of Europe.\nAt that same time, the Soviets advanced quickly into eastern Poland and took control \nof much territory. In June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied the Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) and annexed Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina from Roma-nia. Moreover, the Soviet Union invaded Finland on November 30, 1939, beginning the Winter War, which lasted until March 1940, with Finland ceding territory to the Soviet Union.\nAs Poland fell, the British and French remained largely inactive in what was called \n“the Phony War,” also called the “Sitzkrieg” or Sitting War, lasting until May 1940. During this time, there was no real fighting on the Western Front. Eventually, the phony war period came to an end when Germany invaded Denmark and Norway on April 9, 1940, to counter the threat of an Allied invasion from the region. Heavy fight-ing ensued on land and at sea in Norway. British, French, and Polish forces landed to support the Norwegians. By early June, all Allied forces were evacuated, and the Norwegian Army surrendered.\nOn the Western Front, Germany invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, and France on \nMay 10, 1940. The Allies had expected a WWI-style of trench warfare and were not prepared for this sudden invasion. German forces then invaded France in Operation Red, advancing behind the Maginot Line and near the coast. The rapid success of the Germans on the Western Front prompted Mussolini to declare war on Britain and France on June 10, 1940. Mussolini mistakenly calculated that the war was closer to its end and wanted to be on the winning side. On June 14, Paris surrendered to the Germans. An armistice was declared on June 22, 1940. According to the terms of the armistice, Germany occupied northern France, including the territory along the Atlantic coast to the Spanish border. In southern France, the Vichy France puppet"

The offen -\nsive was to be launched from the air. Fighter aircraft fought overhead for months \nas the Luftwaffe (the German Air Force) and Royal Air Force fought for control of Britain’s skies before a full-scale invasion of Britain. The Luftwaffe initially targeted the British Royal Air Force (RAF) but turned to terror bombing of London. Never -\ntheless, the British invented and used a new detection instrument, “Radar” (then called RDF—Radio Direction Finding), to locate the attackers beforehand. Indeed, the RAF considerably reduced the number of German bombers and fighter planes in air battles. Similar efforts were made, though at sea, in the Battle of the Atlantic. In a long-running campaign, German U-Boats attempted to deprive the British Isles of necessary cargo from the United States. Shipments were reduced considerably by the U-Boats. However, Winston Churchill, who had replaced Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister of Britain in May 1940, refused to seek peace, stating that “We shall never surrender!”\nAfter Germany’s failure in the Battle of Britain, “Operation Barbarossa”, the German \ninvasion of the Soviet Union, commenced on June 22, 1941. The “Great Patriotic War” had begun with surprise attacks by German panzer armies, which encircled and de-stroyed much of the Soviet Union’s western military, capturing or killing hundreds of thousands of men. As Soviet forces came to fight a war of scorched earth, the German army withdrew into the steppes of Russia to gain time and stretch the German army. Industries were dismantled and withdrawn to the Ural Mountains for reassembly. German armies pursued a three-pronged advance against Leningrad (modern-day St. Petersburg), Moscow, and Stalingrad (now Volgograd). Having pushed to occupy Moscow before winter, German forces were delayed into the Soviet winter. A rout was narrowly avoided when Soviet counterattacks defeated them within sight of Moscow.

Through this attack, the Japanese sank 19 \nAmerican ships and destroyed 188 planes. The attack also killed more than 2,400 people and wounded another 1,100 or more. On the following day, the United States declared war on Japan. The incident gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the pretext to join the war in Europe. On their part, Germany and Italy declared war on the Unit -\ned States on December 11, 1941. Hitler made the declaration in the hopes that Japan would support him by attacking the Soviet Union. \nThe Pearl Harbor incident made the war fully a world war. The entry of USA into the \nwar upset the balance of power in the ongoing war. Until then, Japan’s expansion had gone virtually unopposed. In August 1942, the war was being fought in several fronts situated in Eastern Europe, North Africa and the Mediterranean, Burma and China, and the Atlantic and the Pacific. Elsewhere, fierce battles were still raging. In North Africa, the German forces commanded by General Erwin Rommel had dominated the desert war since 1941. In 1942, the Germans nearly took Egypt. In late October 1942, British and Commonwealth troops under General Bernard Montgomery launched a major attack against Rommel’s troops. Allied forces landed in Algeria and Morocco in November 1942. Fierce battles continued in the desert and in Tunisia, which came to an end with the victory of Allied troops. In May 1943, the Axis forces in North Africa surrendered to the Allies. Then followed, in July 1943, the invasion of Italy. Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy, deposed Mussolini and appointed Marshal Pietro Badoglio as Prime Minister of Italy. Although Marshal Badoglio promised Hitler that Italy would continue the the war on the Axis side, he signed a secret act of surrender to the Allies. Suspecting this, Hitler sent German forces into Italy, which occupied Rome and rescued Mussolini, who was put in control of northern Italy. Heavy fighting went on in Italy until the end of the war, but on June 4, 1944, Allied troops occupied Rome. At the end of the war, Mussolini was captured by Italian communists and shot by them."

This inva-\nsion was named Operation Overlord. The commander of the Allied troops, the Amer-ican General Dwight Eisenhower, organized around 150,000 troops, 5,300 ships, and 12,000 planes for the invasion. In preparation for the attack, Allied forces and their war machines and supplies had assembled in southern England. Allied troops launched the attack along a 96-kilometer stretch of the Normandy coast. Within a month and a half, they had liberated almost all of France. In the meantime, General Charles de Gaulle, the leader of Free France, triumphantly entered Paris on August 25, 1944. Meanwhile, on the Eastern Front, the Soviets made rapid advances. They liberated the Soviet cities and territories one after the other. By early 1944, the So-viet Red Army had reached the border of Poland. On June 22, “Operation Bagration,” a Soviet offensive involving 2.5 million men and 6,000 tanks, was launched, destroy -\ning the German Army and taking 350,000 prisoners. Between August and October 1944, the major parts of Eastern and Central Europe were under Soviet control. In the Pacific, US forces were in a life-or-death struggle against the Japanese. The battle of Midway Island in 1942, fought entirely by carrier-borne aircraft, was a decisive defeat for the Japanese navy. From then on, the US forces were pushing the Japanese back in the Pacific, and by 1944, they were getting ready to invade mainland Japan.\nAt the end of 1944, Allied troops, advancing from the west, invaded western Germa-\nny. On the other hand, the Red Army under the command of Marshal Zhukov began its final assault on Berlin on 16 April. Hitler and his staff moved into an underground bunker, where on April 30, 1945, he committed suicide. The Western Allies celebrat -\ned “V-E Day” on 8 May and the Soviet Union’s “Victory Day” on 9 May.\nAfter the Soviets had reached the eastern borders of pre-war Germany in February \n1945, Winston Churchill, Franklin, D. Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin met at Yalta (now located in Ukraine) to make plans to end the war and to discuss the future of Eastern Europe. Germany itself was to be divided into American, British, and French military zones."

An important result of \nthis series of meetings between the victorious leaders was the establishment of the UN. In April 1945, in San Francisco, many nations signed the charter. They agreed to set up a new international organization that would be strong enough to prevent war. Most wars in history have ended with the signing of peace treaties. But no general treaty was signed at the end of World War II. The nations that had been able to unite for war were not able to unite for peace. Soon after the war had been over, the Allies could not agree among themselves.\nDespite Germany’s surrender, the Second World War was not yet over. The Allies \nhad to fight the Japanese in Asia and the Pacific, who continued fighting after “V-E Day”. The Japanese government was forced to surrender due to the use of the newly invented atomic bomb. On August 6, 1945, the American B-52 bomber dropped the first atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. On August 9, the second bomb was dropped on another Japanese city, Nagasaki. The bombs caused immense hu-man and material destruction. On the days of the bombing, 80,000 people in Hiroshi-ma and 40,000 people in Nagasaki lost their lives. Long after the bombing, victims continued to suffer and die from radiation sickness. As a result, the death toll rose to about 200,000.\nAccording to the US President, Harry S. Truman, the atomic bombs were used to \nhasten the Japanese surrender. However, Soviet historians argue that in terms of mil -\nitary strategy, the use of the bombs was not required. Since Japan was the only Axis power still in the war, its surrender could have been forced without those bombs."

One of the distinguishing features of the war was its totality. The peace settlement of World War I and its failure to resolve the unsettled issues that had caused the Great War would lay the basis for the outbreak of World War II in 1939.\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 was a political movement in Russia that climaxed \nin 1917 with the overthrow of the Provisional Government that had replaced the Russian monarchy and led to the establishment of the Soviet Union. The two distinct phases of the revolution were: the February Revolution of 1917, which displaced the autocracy of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia; and the October Revolution, in which Lenin’s Bolshevik party seized power from the Provisional Government.\nThe inter-war period is the period between World War I and World War II. This pe -\nriod witnessed the Great Depression and the rise of dictators. The Great Depression \n(1929-1933) was a massive global economic recession (or “depression”). The politi-cal effects of the depression were disastrous internationally. The depression helped the militarists to take power in Japan and was a major factor in enabling Mussolini and Hitler to take power in Italy and Germany. Fascism was aggressive and violent, which glorified war and violence. \nWorld War II was a conflict that involved much of the globe and is generally accepted \nas the largest and deadliest war in human history. The conflict began on September 1, 1939, with the German invasion of Poland and lasted in mid-1945, involving many of the world’s countries. The war was fought between the Axis Powers and the Allies.

It also left millions of homeless refugees. At the end of the World War II, the European economy had collapsed, and 70% of the European industrial infrastructure was destroyed. \nWorld War II was never formally terminated. As in 1919, no peace treaty ratified \nthe defeat of Germany. In contrast to World War I, the Western victors in the Sec -\nond World War did not demand compensation from the defeated nations. On the contrary, a plan created by U. S. Secretary of State George Marshall, the “European Recovery Program”, better known as the Marshall Plan, called for the U.S. Congress to allocate billions of dollars for the reconstruction of Europe. \nThe war served as a catalyst for major changes such as the redrawing of European \nborders, the communist takeover of China and Eastern Europe, the creation of Isra -\nel, and the divisions of Germany and Korea. It was also because of this war that, for the first time in modern history, geopolitical power shifted away from western and central Europe. That multi-polar world was replaced by a bipolar one dominated by the two most powerful victors, the United States and the Soviet Union. The war increased the strength of independence movements in African, Asian, and American colonies, and most of them became independent in the following twenty years. A new international order was constructed since the League of Nations had obviously failed to prevent the war. In 1945, the United Nations was founded. Moreover, the following global organizations came into being: the World Bank, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nIn the areas occupied by Western Allied troops, democratic governments were cre-\nated; in the areas occupied by Soviet troops, communist governments were created. Germany was partitioned into four zones of occupation, with the American, British, and French zones grouped as West Germany and the Soviet zone as East Germany.

Marshall proposed a program of aid designed to speed Europe -\nan recovery. This program of financial assistance was known as European Recovery Program (ERP) or the Marshall Plan, named after U.S. Secretary of State.  Rejected by the Soviet-dominated governments to the East, the Marshall Plan made possi -\nble a miraculous economic recovery in the West. There are many suggested reasons behind America’s decision to aid West European nations. Firstly, Europe had been a great market for American goods; without a prosperous Europe, the United States might have suffered a severe economic depression. Secondly, Western Europe would be open to influence by the Soviet Union. Finally, Germany should be integrated into a larger Europe  and it should be used as a buffer against Soviet expansion. \nOn April 3, 1948, the law providing for the European Recovery Program (ERP , Mar-\nshall Plan) was signed by President Truman. The European countries which partic-ipated in this program established a permanent organization known as the Organi-zation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), with headquarters in Paris. The largest amounts of money went to Britain, France, Italy, and West Germany. , in that order. The US Congress granted more than $13 billion in aid. \nAs Cold War tensions rose in 1949, the funds increasingly went into military expen-\nditures rather than industrial rebuilding. However, the Marshall Plan did much to set the European economy back on its feet after the war and to foster economic co-oper -\nation. Moreover, the program achieved both its immediate and long-term aims: When the aid ended in 1952, Communist control of Western Europe had been averted, the region’s industrial production stood 35 percent above pre-war levels, and West Ger -\nmany was independent, rearming, and economically booming. The Marshall Plan also increased the co-operation of European states among themselves."

The term “Third World” arose during the Cold War to define countries that remained non-aligned with either NATO or the Warsaw Pact. Accord-ing to this political and economic division, the USA, Canada, Japan, South Korea, and Western European nations and their allies represented the “First World,” while the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Vietnam, and their allies represented the “Second World.” The Third World is normally seen to include many countries with colonial pasts in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. It is being replaced with terms such as developing \ncountries, least developed countries or the Global South.Classifying Countries into the Third World and the North-South DivisionDuring World War II, the Eastern European countries either fell under Nazi occupa-\ntion or allied themselves with the Nazi regime. Towards the end of the war, Soviet troops occupied all but Yugoslavia and Albania, freeing them from German control. Soon after the end of the war, Stalin imposed communist governments in the Sovi-et-occupied countries of Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. As a result, as the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said in 1946, “an iron cur-tain has descended across the continent,” separating Eastern and Western Europe. The phrase “iron curtain” came to describe a policy of isolation that prevented travel and communication between the two regions.\nThe Soviet Union created the Molotov Plan (named after Soviet Foreign Minister Mo-\nlotov) in 1947 to provide aid to rebuild the countries in Eastern Europe that were politically and economically aligned with the Soviet Union. This plan was the Sovi-et Union’s version of the Marshall Plan. The Molotov Plan was a system of bilateral trade agreements that also established the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON or CMEA) in January 1949 to create an economic alliance of socialist countries. The original members were Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union. Later, Albania, East Germany, the Republic of Mon -\ngolia, Cuba, Vietnam, Yugoslavia, Angola, and Ethiopia (with observer status) also joined it.

Historians differ regarding the beginning date of the Cold War, but 1947 is usu-ally pointed out as the starting year for the Cold War.\nThe prolonged global contest led by the two superpowers, the USA and the USSR, \nwas popularly termed “The Cold War.” The two superpowers did not directly engage each other, but both sought to extend their influence and win territorial advantages in adjacent parts of the world. The Cold War took the form of an arms race involving"

The major civil wars polarized along Cold War lines were the Greek Civil War, the Korean War, the Viet-nam War, and the Soviet-Afghan War, along with more peripheral conflicts in Angola, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. It should be noted that the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 was the most important direct confrontation, together with a series of confronta -\ntions over the Berlin Blockade and the Berlin Wall.\nThe Major Characteristic Features of the Cold War\nA major characteristic feature of the Cold War was the arms race between the mem -\nber states of the NATO and those of Warsaw Pact. This resulted in substantial scien-tific discoveries in many technological and military fields. Some particularly revolu-tionary advances were made in the field of nuclear weapons and rockets, which led to the space race. Many of the rockets used to launch humans and satellites into space were originally based on military designs formulated during this period. Other fields in which arms races occurred include: jet fighters, bombers, chemical weapons, bi-ological weapons, anti-aircraft warfare, surface-to-surface missiles, inter-continen-tal ballistic missiles, anti-tank weapons, submarines, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, electronic intelligence, signals intelligence, reconnaissance aircraft and spy satellites. The Cold War was primarily fought by intelligence agencies like the CIA (United States), MI6 (United Kingdom), BND (West Germany), Stasi (East Germany) and the KGB (Soviet Union). \nCold War hostilities reached peak in the period between the changes in leadership \nfor both superpowers in 1953 to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Major events took place in this period included the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the erection of the Ber-lin Wall in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and the Prague Spring in 1968 (a movement to reform the Communist system in Czechoslovakia). During the Cuban Missile Crisis the world was closest to a third (nuclear) world war. \nThe period between the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the rise of Mikhail \nGorbachev as Soviet leader in 1985 was characterized by a marked “freeze” in rela -\ntions between the superpowers after the Detente period of the 1970s. The election of Margaret Thatcher as UK Prime Minister in 1979, followed by that of Ronald Reagan to the American Presidency in 1980, saw the elevation of two hard-line Cold War-riors to the leadership of the Western World."

Why did the Chernobyl accident happen in 1986?\nNATO: North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was a regional defense alliance created \nin April, 1949. NATO has its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. It was an association of twelve states (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States). It de-clared that an armed attack on any one of them in Europe or North America would be regarded as an attack on all of them. Greece and Turkey joined the alliance in 1952, the German Federal Republic (West Germany) in 1955 and Spain in 1982. It was a de-fensive gesture by the principal western powers based on fear of Russian aggression. \nThe dissolution of the Communist bloc and the breakup of the Soviet Union drastical -\nly reduced the military threat to NATO.

The rearmament of West Germany and its admission to NATO prompted the establishment of the Warsaw Pact.

The scarcity of \nfood had to be offset by imports from the Allied powers, and from the United States in particular. Severe bombing during the war had almost abolished Japanese indus-trial capacity. To revive the Japanese economy, the USA encouraged the Japanese gov -\nernment to curb inflation and cracked down on Communist unions that used strikes for political ends. The United States also gave Japan $2 billion in economic aid.\nBrainstorming Question»When was the period of US occupation ended? How?\nThe question of rearmament was widely debated throughout 1952. The government \nwas reluctant to commit itself in favor of rebuilding the country’s defenses, mainly because of economic difficulties and legal obstacles (in the Japanese constitution of 1947 war is renounced “forever”). \nActivity 5.8\n1.What do you characterize the Japanese economy after 1945?\nIn October 1956, the Soviet Union and Japan agreed to end the technical state of war \nthat had existed between the two countries since August 1945. In December 1945, the UN General Assembly voted unanimously to admit Japan to the United Nations. While maintaining close relations with the United States, Japan sought to expand trade with the USSR and China as a means of reducing unemployment.\nBrainstorming Questions»What do you know about Japan’s rapid economic growth in the post-war period? \n»What were the factors behind Japan’s rapid economic growth?\nJapanese productivity in 1945 was about the same as it had been in 1918.

The international situation was also favorable: oil was cheap, access to raw materials and export markets was easy, and American sponsorship gained Japan early entry into the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations. Japan’s high rate of savings also contributed to reinvestment. New technology and education also stimulated growth. In the postwar period, an increasing number of people gained access to universities. Another factor was the abundance of high-quality, cheap labor. Government economic policy also played a crucial role in Japanese success. Governmental measures helped accelerate savings and investment, the absorption of new technologies, and the shift to modern industries and high-value exports.\nThe Indian Independence Movement\nIndia was the most important colony of the British. It was exploited by European \ncolonial powers from 1605 to 1947.\nBrainstorming Question\n»What was Mahatma Gandhi’s method of struggle against British colonial rule?\nThe Indian independence movement was a series of historic events with the aim of \nending British rule in India. The movement spanned from 1857 to 1947. The Indian \nNational Congress, which was founded in 1885, played a leading role in the strug-gle for national independence. Initially, the Indian elite sought only more economic rights under British rule, but later on, in the early 20\nth century, the movement saw a \nmore radical approach towards political self-rule. On their part, the British worked to sow differences between Muslims and Hindus. That was aimed at weakening the struggle of Indians for self-rule. In 1906, the Muslim League split away from the In -\ndian National Congress to stand for the rights of Indian Muslims. And the League be-came a rallying point for Muslims, while the Indian National Congress was identified with Hindus. \nDuring the inter-war period, Congress adopted Mahatma Gandhi’s policy of non-vio-\nlence and civil disobedience as forms of struggle against British colonial rule.

The British gov -\nernment agreed to give independence to two separate states in the Indian sub-con -\ntinent, namely Pakistan (Muslim) and India (predominantly Hindu) in 1947. Finally, on January 26, 1947, India became an independent state, with Jawaharlal Nehru as its first Prime Minister. Pakistan gained independence as well, with Mohammed Ali Jinnah as its first President. Moreover, in 1971, East Pakistan declared independence as the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.

The CCP , with a better disciplined Red Army and widespread peasant support, completely defeated the KMT forces in just four years. In October 1949, the Chinese Communist Party won the civil war and established the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland, led by Mao Tse-tung (Mao Zedong). The Kuomintang, which was led by Chiang Kai-shek, fled to the island province of Taiwan, and estab -\nlished a Nationalist government.\nThe first step taken by the Communist government was military consolidation. It \nalso brought an end to the long period of Western domination of China. Regions within the country’s historic boundaries that had fallen away were reclaimed.

The decade that followed is often \ncalled the “Soviet Period” because the Soviet model was adopted for the government, the army, the economy, and higher education. During the Korean War (1950–1953), Chinese troops aided the Communist regime of North Korea against South Korean and United Nations forces. China also aided the Communist insurgents fighting the French in Vietnam.\nStarting in the second half of the 1950s, Sino-Soviet relations deteriorated, partly \nbecause of border disputes and Chinese dissatisfaction with the level of Soviet aid, and partly because the Chinese restored non-Soviet methods to accelerate the pace of their revolution.\nBrainstorming Question\n»What were the major socio-economic reforms introduced by the CCP?\nTo revive the economy, which had been disrupted by decades of warfare, the CCP \nadopted a new policy for economic development. A major achievement of the new regime was to curtail famine. The CCP also made fundamental changes to society. Women also received equal rights with respect to divorce, employment, and owner -\nship of property. The CCP assumed strict control over religion, forcing foreign mis -\nsionaries to leave the country.

What do you know about the \nGreat Leap Forward?\nBy 1956, Mao felt that even intellectuals should be adequately indoctrinated. Thus, Mao launched a campaign to expose the party to the criticism of Chinese intellectuals under the slogan “Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom.” Although most intellectuals were cautious at first, Mao repeatedly urged people to speak up. In 1957, Mao changed course and launched the so-called “anti-rightist” campaign against the critics for harboring rightist ideology. About half a million educated people lost their jobs and often their freedom, usually because something they had said during the Hundred Flowers period had been interpreted as anti-Communist.\nIn 1958, Mao took ideology a step further and abandoned the Soviet model in favor"

He called it the Great \nLeap Forward. \nWithin a couple of years, the Great Leap had proved an economic disaster. Industrial \nproduction dropped by as much as 50 percent between 1959 and 1962. Grain was taken from the countryside based on wildly exaggerated production reports, con -\ntributing, along with environmental calamities, to a massive famine from 1960 to 1962 in which more than 20 million people died. The utter failure of the Great Leap Forward and the consequent widespread hunger and malnutrition led China to turn toward a more moderate economic policy. Mao retained his position as the head of the party but gave up his post as head of state to another veteran Communist official.\nThe Great Proletariat Cultural Revolution, 1965-1976 \nBrainstorming Question\n»What do you know about the Chinese Great Proletariat Cultural Revolution?\nIn mid-1966, Mao launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, known simply \nas the Cultural Revolution. The announced goals of the revolution were to eradicate the remains of so-called bourgeois ideas and customs and to recapture the revolu -\ntionary zeal of early Chinese Communism. Mao also wanted to increase his power over the government by discrediting or removing party leaders who had challenged his authority or disagreed with his policies. He called for a new revolution to create a truly egalitarian culture, urging students and teenaged youth to form bands of Red Guards and attack the party bureaucracy.\nIn June 1966, nearly all Chinese schools and universities were closed as students \ndevoted themselves full-time to Red Guard activities. Joined by groups of workers, peasants, and demobilized soldiers, the Red Guards took to the streets in pro-Mao-ist, sometimes violent, demonstrations. They made intellectuals, bureaucrats, party officials, and urban workers their chief targets. The central party structure was de-stroyed as many high officials were removed from their positions. During the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, college professors, middle-school teachers, news-paper journalists, musicians, party cadres, factory managers, and others who could be categorized as educated suffered a wide variety of brutal treatments. Men and women were tortured, imprisoned, starved, denied medical treatment, and forced to leave their children unsupervised when they were sent to labor camps in the coun -"

In 1968 and 1969, \nhe called in the army to take over the revolutionary committees. In 1969, a new Cen-\ntral Committee, composed largely of military men, was established, and General Lin Piao was named as Mao’s successor.\nThe second phase of the Cultural Revolution, during the years between 1969 and \n1976, was moderate only in comparison with what had gone before. On farms and in factories, ideology was still seen as an adequate substitute for economic incentives. Universities reopened but students were admitted not by examinations but by their class background. In 1971, Lin Piao, who was regularly referred to as Mao’s closest comrade in arms and best student, turned against Mao. Lin plotted unsuccessfully to assassinate Mao, but he was killed in an airplane crash while attempting to flee to the USSR. Lin’s place was taken by the so-called Gang of Four. \nChina after Mao\nMao died in 1976. In that same year, the Gang of Four and other prominent radical \nofficials were arrested. The Gang of Four was charged with the crimes of the Cultural Revolution. This event came to mark the official end of the campaign.\nGreater tolerance on the part of the government soon resulted in a much better \npress and media in China. This, in turn, fueled calls for greater liberty and political democracy. Student protests occurred in several cities during the 1980s. The most massive one occurred in Beijing in 1989. In April and May of 1989, hundreds of thousands of students, workers, and people from all walks of life demonstrated for democracy in Tiananmen Square in Peking and in dozens of other cities. As a sym-bol of their protest, demonstrators erected a 10-m (33-ft) statue called the Goddess of Democracy. The protesters occupied Beijing’s Tiananmen Square until the morn-ing of June 4. The government sent tanks and troops. Hundreds of students were killed, and the leaders who did not escape abroad were jailed. \nActivity 5.10\n1.Why did Communism remain in China?"

How did Vietnam start anti-colonial struggle?\nFrance completed its conquest of Vietnam and Cambodia by 1883, formed the Indo-\nchinese Union in 1887, and added Laos to the Union in 1893. This union was known as the Indochinese Union or French Indochina.\nIn the early 20th century, as Vietnamese nationalism rose, political exiles in China, Japan, and France formed nationalist parties. But when they tried to organize within Vietnam, their leaders were jailed or executed. Under the French, only clandestine parties sur -\nvived. The most skilled organizer of such parties was Ho Chi Minh. Ho founded the Indo -\nchinese Communist Party in 1930. In 1940–41, however, the Japanese occupied Vietnam. Ho organized the broad Vietminh Front and prepared to launch an uprising. Therefore, Ho led the Vietnamese against French and Japanese forces for control of their homeland.\nAt the end of World War II, Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, \nwith Ho as president. However, France was unwilling to cede its former colony. For more than a year, the French and Vietnamese sought a negotiated solution. But the talks failed to resolve differences, chiefly because of the French determination to reoccupy Vietnam. The war between the two lasted from 1946 to 1954. In late 1946, France drove the Viet -\nnamese out of southern Vietnam. The French tried to legitimize their rule by setting up a puppet government. In 1954, after eight years of guerrilla attacks by the Vietnamese and a major defeat at the battle of Dien Bien Phu, the French government agreed to negotia -\ntions to end the war. At a conference held in Geneva, the two sides accepted an interim compromise to end the war. They divided the country at the 17\nth parallel, with the Viet -\nnamese in the north and the French and their Vietnamese supporters in the south. Thus, the country was divided into a Communist north and a non-Communist south.\nThe Vietnam War \nAfter Geneva, the Vietnamese in Hanoi began to build a Communist society. In the southern capital, Saigon, the non- Communist regime was toppled by an anti-Com -\nmunist president Ngo Dinh Diem (1901–1963), who declared the Republic of South-ern Vietnam. With diplomatic support from the United States, Diem refused to hold elections and attempted to destroy Communist influence in the South.

In the political confusion that followed, the security situation in South Viet -\nnam continued to deteriorate, putting the Communists within reach of victory. In early 1965, to prevent the total collapse of the Saigon regime, US President Lyndon Johnson approved the regular intensive bombing of North Vietnam and the dispatch of US combat troops into the South, marking the overt entry of the United States into the Vietnam War. Eventually, however, the resistance of the South Vietnamese forces collapsed, and on April 30, 1975, the Communists seized power in Saigon. There-fore, despite massive support, South Vietnam and the United States lost the war. The Vietnam War had left more than 15 per cent of the Vietnamese population killed or wounded. In 1976, the South was reunited with the North in a new Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City.\nBrainstorming Question»What were the reasons behind the defeat of South Vietnam and the United States?\nThere are several reasons for the defeat of South Vietnam and the United States by \nthe North during the Vietnam War. The South Vietnamese government was corrupt and unpopular; Ho Chi Minh was a national hero not only for the northerners but also for South Vietnamese; even anti-Communists viewed the USA as the successor to France and supported Communist guerrillas; both the Communist guerrillas in the south and the North Vietnamese troops fought better than the South Vietnamese troops; the jungle terrain of Vietnam made the US’s military technology ineffective; and strong opposition against US involvement in Vietnam at home forced the US to withdraw its troops.\nKorea: Partition and WarBrainstorming Question»How was Korea partitioned?"

The USA and the USSR divided \nKorea along the thirty-eighth parallel into American and Soviet zones of liberation af-ter World War II. Both the USA and the USSR used their presence to promote friendly governments. The USSR gave its support to Kim Il Sung, a Communist who had led anti-Japanese guerrillas. In the South, the United States suppressed Syngman Rhee, a nationalist who had opposed the Japanese and had lived in exile in the United States. Both Kim Il Sung and Syngman Rhee strongly favored reunification, but each under their own rules, of course. In 1947, both the US and the USSR began arranging sepa-rate governments. Subsequently, US-sponsored elections in 1948 led to the founding of the Republic of Korea (south) in August 1948. The north followed in September 1948 by establishing the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\nThe War\nBrainstorming Question\n»What was the immediate cause of the Korean War?\nThe Korean War was a military struggle fought between 1950 and 1953. Consider -\nable civil strife in South Korea and growing opposition to President Syngman Rhee \npersuaded Kim Il Sung that he would be welcomed by many South Koreans as a lib -\nerator to overthrow the Rhee government and reunite the two Koreas. Hence, the North Korean army, substantially equipped by the Soviet Union, invaded South Korea on June 23, 1950. The Cold War had already begun in Europe, and the invasion, was seen in the United States as an act of aggression by world Communism. Thus, the conflict swiftly developed into a limited international war involving the United States and 19 other nations.\nThe United States immediately responded by sending troops from Japan to South \nKorea. On June 27, the UN Security Council, with the Soviet Union voluntarily ab-sent, passed a US-sponsored resolution calling for military sanctions against North Korea. 19 UN member states including Etthiopia sent soldiers to support South Ko-rea against the North. The UN force was placed under An American officer, General Douglas MacArthur. The action was unique because neither the UN nor its predeces -\nsor, the League of Nations, had ever used military measures to repel an aggressor.\nThe Communist offensive was halted in January 1951. Finally, the war became stale-\nmated in 1951 and ended with an armistice on July 27, 1973. The Korean War was one of the most destructive conflicts of the twentieth century. The Korean War re-"

Soon after the end of World War I, the Ottoman Empire was par -\ntitioned between the British and the French. Five new mandate states were created: Britain took over Iraq, Palestine, and Transjordan (now Jordan), while France took Syria and Lebanon. The Middle East was more united under the Turks than under the West. Nationalism has been a powerful force shaping the destiny of the region. \nIn their mandated territories Britain and France encountered demands from Arab \nnationalists and others for greater independence. The French rule was eliminated by the British when the French authorities in Syria and Lebanon declared for Vichy. But British rule, was maintained. The British were therefore the sole surviving target of Arab nationalism."

In 1946, \nthe mandate was replaced by a treaty of alliance, and Transjordan was made inde -\npendent. In 1947, Britain referred the future of Palestine to the United Nations (UN). The UN adopted the decision that partitioned Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state. Although Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt obtained sovereign-state status after World War I, and Lebanon and Syria were officially given their freedom during World War II, these states only became truly independent after World War II. \nSince World War II, the Middle East has been encountered with two main types of \nconflict: internal and interstate. It should be noted that the two conflicts also over -\nlapped in some Middle East countries. In major conflicts included the civil war in Lebanon from 1975 to 1989; the civil war in Yemen, the long Kurdish insurgency in Turkey (1989 to 2000), the persistent Arab-Israeli dispute; and the Suez Crisis of 1956; the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988, the Gulf War of 1990-1991 and the War on Iraq of 2003.  \nActivity 5.111. What were the reasons behind these conflicts?\nZionism and the Creation of the State of Israel\nBrainstorming Question»What were the causes of the Arab-Israeli dispute?\nThe Jewish people were expelled from the land of Palestine by the Romans in 70 AD. \nThis episode is known in history as “Diaspora” (Greek for “dispersion”). But the Jews had long maintained the idea of regaining control of the area, which they considered home. In 1897, Theodor Herzl (1860–1904), a Jewish journalist living in Austria, founded the Zionist Movement that advocated re-establishing a Jewish state in Pales-tine. This idea became the foundation of a movement known as Zionism. Zionism is both a religious and political movement among the Jewish people with the aim of creating a Jewish state in the territory defined as the historic Land of Israel in Pales -\ntine, then an area controlled by the Ottoman Empire.\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Zionist movement gained \nstrength in Europe, and large numbers of Jews migrated to Palestine. The movement focused on self-reliance through agriculture, and many immigrants settled in the countryside. To do so, Jews had to buy land from local Arab holders of small tracts"

As a result, Jews and Arabs came \ninto increasing contact; at times, Jewish purchases led to the displacement of Arab peasants from the land. Although the Ottoman government sought to slow the Zion -\nist movement, Jews established a significant and expanded presence.\nDuring World War I, Britain was fighting against Ottoman Turkey. In return for their \nhelp in the war, Britain had promised autonomy to both Zionists and Arabs. Thus, in 1917, the British issued the Balfour Declaration, which favored the establishment of a national homeland for the Jews in Palestine. The interwar period witnessed in-creasing Jewish settlement and growing communal conflict that was poorly mediat-ed by the British. Terrorist attacks and intermittent low-level warfare were carried out by both Jews and Arabs.\nAfter World War II, the world became aware of the murder of millions of Jews in the \nHolocaust, and opinion began to favor creating an independent Jewish state. Arabs in Palestine and elsewhere continued to resist the idea, but on November 29, 1947, the United Nations (UN) passed a resolution which called for the partition of Pales-tine into separate Jewish and Arab states. The Arab states refused to accept the U.N. resolution, but the Jewish leaders in Palestine proclaimed the independent state of Israel in 1948.\nThe Arab-Israeli Wars and the Peacemaking Efforts\nThe declaration of the state of Israel led to the Israeli-Arab War of 1948, in which Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia attacked Israel.This was the first of a major series of conflicts between the Jews and the Arabs. In the war, Arab forces had expected an easy victory over the small and isolated Jewish state. Despite heavy casualties, Israel became victorious. Israel not only repulsed the Arab nations but also expanded beyond the U.N. partition line, creating an even larger Jewish nation for the Arabs to deal with. For the surrounding Arab countries, Israel has been a bit-ter problem ever since. The war had created a large population of Palestinian Arab refugees who fled Israel for camps maintained by the UN in neighboring Arab states. The Arab world was unwilling to accept the Israeli victory, and shortly after the war, the Arabs began to regroup for more fighting.\nAfter the 1948 war, the most serious military confrontations between the Jews and \nthe Arabs were the Suez Crisis of 1956, when Israel, with France and Britain, invad-ed the Sinai after Egyptian provocations. In July, 1956, Egypt nationalized the Suez"

During the Suez Crisis, Israel captured the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula. The United States and the United Nations soon pressured it into a ceasefire. Israel agreed to withdraw from Egyptian territory. Egypt agreed to freedom of navigation in the region and the de-militarization of the Sinai.\nIn 1967, Egypt, Syria, and Jordan massed their armies on Israel’s borders, and sev -\neral Arab states called for war. Assuming the Arabs would attack, Israel struck first, \nin June 1967. In the Six-Day War that followed, Israel demolished the armies and air forces of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. It also gained control of the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights of Syria, and all of the previously partitioned city of Jerusalem. In late November, the UN Security Council passed a resolution which called for an exchange of territory for peace and for the resettling of Palestin -\nian refugees. Nevertheless, both Arabs and Israelis rejected the resolution. The Arab states continued to call for the destruction of Israel, while Israel, for its part, refused to withdraw from the territories it occupied.\nAfter the 1967 war, the leading role in the struggle against Israel was taken over \nby Palestinian refugee guerrilla organizations. Under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Palestinians stepped up border raids and terror -\nist attacks inside Israel. Israeli counterterrorist activities and harsh treatment of Ar-abs living within Israel’s borders cost Israel some international support from this time on.\nIn October 1973, the Arabs attacked Israel on the Jewish holiday known as Yom Kip-\npur, and caught Israel by surprise. Egypt and Syria pushed across the armistice lines established after the Six-Day War, which had kept Egyptian troops west of the Suez Canal and Syrian troops north-east of the Golan Heights. Israel, however, quickly re -\ncovered from the surprise and again pushed into Arab territory, surrounding, or de-stroying the bulk of the Egyptian and Syrian forces.\nIn the late 1970s, peace initiatives by Egypt’s new leader, Anwar Sadat, were cou-\npled with mediation by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Egypt entered direct negotia -\ntions with Israel’s Prime Minister, Menachem Begin. The two countries reached an agreement known as the Camp David Accords in 1978 and, in 1979, signed a formal peace treaty. Under the peace treaty signed in March 1979, Egypt regained the Sinai"

For these reasons, the Arab League expelled Egypt, and the rest of the Arab world widely condemned the accords. In 1981, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt was assassinated by Egyptian Muslim extremists. \nIn 1982, Israel waged its second invasion (the first in 1978) of Lebanon in the con-\ntext of the Lebanese-Syrian conflict to attack terrorist refuges of the Palestinian Lib -\neration Organization (PLO). The assault on the PLO, which Israel called Operation Peace for Galilee, quickly escalated into ground battles in Lebanon and full-scale en-gagements between the Israeli and Syrian air forces. The invasion finally resulted in defeats for both Syria and the PLO. But Israel’s effort to establish a strong client regime in Beirut failed, and the Israelis eventually withdrew from Lebanon with little but a puppet Christian army in southern Lebanon.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, bloodshed has become commonplace. In the late 1980s, Pal -\nestinians began the intifada (Arabic, “uprising”), a widespread campaign against \nthe continuing Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. The campaign combined elements of mass demonstrations, civil disobedience, riots, and terrorism. The revolutionary impetus of the intifada encouraged the emergence of the radical Islamist Palestinian group called Hamas. Thus, the cycle of violence continues. Even after the historic peace agreement of September 1993 between the PLO and Israel, not all Arab states, particularly Syria, have been willing to sit at the negotiation table with Israel, and Israel has remained unchanged in its determination to expand West Bank settlements, publicly announcing its determination to retain all of Jerusalem and parts of the occupied territories. \nActivity 5.12\n1.

Reagan believed that rather than appeasement, the Soviets should be challenged. He expanded American military capabilities to levels not seen since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Regan’s declaration that the Soviets were “an Evil Empire” started a western world policy of an enhanced and updated military build-up and a threat to develop a Strategic Defense Initiative (also known as “Star Wars”) that the Soviets would never be able to compete with financially. Although re-form in the Soviet Union slowed down between 1969 and 1982, a generational shift gave new momentum for reform with the coming to power of Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985. The Chernobyl Accident in 1986 also added impetus for reform.\nThe Chernobyl Accident of 1986 was a nuclear power plant disaster at Chernobyl, \nin the Ukrainian Republic of the USSR. The accident produced a spiral of radioactive debris that drifted over parts of the western USSR, Eastern Europe, and Scandinavia. It was the worst nuclear power accident in history. Large areas of the Ukrainian, Byelorussian, and Russian republics of the USSR were contaminated, resulting in the evacuation and resettlement of  200,000 people. The accident raised concerns about the safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry while forcing the Soviet government to become less secretive.\nGorbachev and his supporters challenged the way the party and bureaucracy had \ntraditionally managed the Soviet government and economy.

The government also relaxed restrictions on foreign trade and investment.  Despite these organizational changes, the Soviet economy stagnated and even declined. The shortage of food, consumer goods, and housing has become chronic. \nIn addition , Gorbachev soon launched ambitious political and social reforms. The \nmost dramatic change was adopting glasnost, or openness about public affairs. This \nreform allowed an exceptionally broad public discussion and criticism of Soviet his -\ntory and Soviet Communist Party policy. In quick succession, the Soviet authorities released political prisoners, relaxed censorship in the mass media, encouraged de -\nbate over the sins of the Soviet past. Gorbachev accompanied these measures with a shift in foreign policy, pledging to curb Soviet military spending and negotiate an end to the Cold War with the West. It should be noted that Gorbachev and Reagan held a series of summit talks between 1985, and 1987 the two leaders agreed to eliminate their countries’ nuclear missiles, those capable of striking Europe and Asia from the USSR and vice versa. The Soviet government began to reduce its forces in Eastern Europe, and in 1989 it pulled its troops out of Afghanistan.\nFigure 5.3 R. Reagan and M. Gorbachev\nActivity 5.13\n1.

The liberation of East Europe inspired many Soviet Union republics to struggle harder for liberation from Moscow. Gorbachev resisted the dissolution of the Union. He threatened military force against any republic that attempted secession. Liberation movements simply grew stronger. Finally, Gorbachev attempted to restructure the Soviet Union into a less centralized state by offering the republics autonomy within a union.\nThe Soviet republics accelerated their process of independence, declaring their sov -\nereignty one by one. On September 6, 1991, the Soviet government recognized the \nindependence of the three Baltic States. Then, on December 1, 1991, Ukraine reaf-firmed its independence after a popular referendum in which 90% of voters opted for independence. On December 8, 1991, the leaders of the Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian republics met and signed the Belavezha Accords, declaring the Soviet Union dissolved and replaced by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).\nConsequences of the Collapse of the Communist Bloc\nThe fall of Communism and the collapse of the Soviet Union meant the end of the Cold War. Hence, the world began to see different domestic politics, economic poli -\ncies, and international relations. \nThe problems in the new political and economic situation are enormous. Unemploy -\nment was widespread throughout the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. As \na result, hundreds of thousands of people began migrating from Eastern to West-ern Europe to look for work. Economic problems in some East European countries helped former communists to regain power. For example, in Poland former Commu -\nnists gained in the elections of 1993.  \nActivity 5.141. Did the fall of Communism bring conflicts to an end in Europe?The collapse of Communism also caused very serious political challenges, particu-\nlarly in different parts of Eastern Europe. Economic strains reinforced ethnic and religious conflicts. A civil war led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The potential for ethnic violence threatened the former Soviet Union. The Czechs and the Slovaks, unable to establish a stable and unified state, hence divided Czechoslovakia into two separate nations in 1993."

Huntington believes that this cultural organization better describes the world than the classical notion of multicultural sovereign states.

Moreover, the war can be identified to varying degrees as the cat-alyst for the communist takeover of China and Eastern Europe, the creation of Israel, and the divisions of Germany and Korea. It also resulted in a shift from a multi-polar world to a bipolar one dominated by the two most powerful victors, the United States and Soviet Union. The United Nations (UN), which grew out of the ant-Fascist war coalition, is an international organization of nation-states, based on the sovereign equality of its members. It was officially established on June 26, 1945 with the major aims of maintaining international peace and security; developing friendly relations among nations; and achieving international cooperation in solving economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian problems and in encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms."

With the help of the British, Emperor Haile Selassie was restored to his throne in May 1941. Nevertheless, the British, who had entered the country as liberators, had in fact replaced the Italians as the occupying power. They assumed a position of ascendancy in the country in the immediate years following the libera-tion period.\nOnce the emperor was restored to the throne, he was largely preoccupied with rela-\ntions with the British. Indeed, there was considerable tension between Ethiopia and Britain. The two governments differed greatly in their views on Ethiopia’s future. The Ethiopian government expected to assume full sovereignty without delay, whereas the British government considered Ethiopia’s independence only a long objective. A first clash on this question occurred as early as 11May 1941, when the Emperor appointed his first post-war cabinet.

The military convention provided for British assistance in the organization of a new Ethiopian army that was to be trained by a British military mission.\nMoreover, British citizens occupied key posts as civil and military advisers. They also \ntrained and led the Ethiopian police force. They also controlled the financial sys-tem. It was agreed that all acts relating to the war effort, domestic or internation -\nal, required British approval. The Emperor even had to get permission from British officials to declare war against any state if necessary, and the Ogaden and certain strategic areas, such as the French Somaliland border, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti rail-road, and the Haud, remained under British administration. In short, by the 1942 Anglo-Ethiopian agreement, Ethiopia was firmly under British economic as well as political control. Hence, the Emperor could not exercise real power.\nBrainstorming Question\n»What were the terms of the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 1944?\nThe second Anglo-Ethiopian agreement was signed in December, 1944. This agree-\nment restored some of the sovereign rights of the Ethiopian government that had been denied by the first agreement. To mention some: the precedence enjoyed by the British minister in Ethiopia over all other diplomatic representatives in the coun -\ntry was lifted. The right to the British government in respect to the appointment of advisers and officials was also lifted.

In \nthe north, there were plans to unite parts of Tigray with the highlands of Eritrea to form a separate state of the Tigregna speakers under British protection. In the south-east, the British government proposed the incorporation of the Ogaden with British Somaliland and the former Italian Somaliland to create Greater Somalia. This new creation was to be placed under British trusteeship. British officials also envisaged the partition of Eritrea, with the western lowlands of Eritrea to be given to the then Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Hence, the plan became a source of fear, suspicion, mistrust, and even anger on the part of Ethiopia.\nEthiopia became a founding member of the United Nations (UN) in 1945 and im-\nmediately made strong demands for both the Ogaden and Eritrea. Historically, the Ogaden had been an integral part of the Ethiopian Empire before the Italian invasion. Ethiopia brought the matter to the 1945 London Conference of the Allied Powers, but the conference didn’t respond to Ethiopia’s claims. Nevertheless, after a long period of diplomatic struggle, the British withdrew from parts of Ogaden in 1948. But the Haud, and what the British called the Reserved Area, remained under British admin -\nistration until 1954. Finally, that same year, the British restored the entire Ogaden region to Ethiopia.\nAfter the Italian surrender, Eritrea remained under British military administration \nfrom 1941 to 1951. Ethiopia waged a long diplomatic struggle to regain Eritrea. Ethi -\nopia had a strong case on the grounds of history, national defense, and access to the sea. Historically, the entire part of Eritrea or simply the Mereb Melash, had been an integral part of the Ethiopian Empire before the Italians established themselves over the area in 1890s. Regarding national defense, Ethiopia cited evidence that Eritrea served as a base both in 1895 and 1935 when Italy invaded the country. The resto-ration of Eritrea is also believed to have answered Ethiopia’s quest for access to the sea.\nUnder British administration, various competing local groups emerged in Eritrea, \nsuch as the Unionist Party, the Muslim League, the Liberal Progressive Party, and a pro-Italian group consisting of Italian settlers, ex-askaris, and people of mixed races. The demands of these local groups are broadly divided into two. These were: union with Ethiopia and independence for Eritrea. The demand for a union was organized by the Unionist Party, which was the largest political group in Eritrea. The demand for independence was organized by a collection of different groups, including: the"

First, a Four \nPowers Commission was established by the Allies of World War II (Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States) to resolve the Eritrean question. Neverthe -\nless, unable to resolve the Eritrean question, the Four Powers referred the matter to the United Nations in 1948. The United Nations appointed a new commission for Er-itrea, consisting of Burma, Guatemala, Norway, Pakistan, and South Africa. The task of the commission was to find out the wishes of the Eritrean people. The UN commis -\nsion arrived in Eritrea in February 1950. Nevertheless, the commission was divided and could not reach a unanimous decision. Guatemala and Pakistan recommended granting independence to Eritrea. South Africa and Burma recommended federation with Ethiopia. Norway recommended Eritria’s union with Ethiopia. Of these three varied recommendations, the UN General Assembly voted for federation. Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia on 2 December 1950 and the federation was put into effect in 1952.\nThe American Era\nBrainstorming Question\n»How was the Ethio-American partnership established?\nFollowing the departure of the British, a United States economic mission arrived, \nthereby laying the groundwork for an alliance. It should be noted that the initiative for a closer relationship between Ethiopia and America came from the former. The Emperor, who was distressed by British domination during the first decade of the post-liberation period, sought the Americans as a counterweight.\nAfter Eritrea federated with Ethiopia, the United States and Ethiopia concluded an \nagreement that gave the United States a twenty-five-year lease on the Kagnew com-munications station in Asmera on May 22, 1953. At that time, Kagnew was one of the largest radio relay and communications monitoring stations in the world. It was of paramount importance to the Americans to monitor Soviet radio communications throughout the region. The radio station was named Kagnew to commemorate the first Ethiopian Battalion, which fought in the Korean war as part of the United Na-tions forces on the American side. In return for its use of Kagnew, the USA pledged to"

By the 1970s, Ethi-opia came to absorb some 60% of the total of American military aid to the African continent. Therefore, the air force, the navy, and the ground forces were equipped with American weapons. By 1974, Ethiopia’s armed forces had become totally de-pendent on the United States for military hardware and spare parts.\nThe Americans were also involved in improving and extending the communication \nand education sectors. The Americans assisted in the establishment of the Ethiopian Air Lines in 1945. The Americans also assisted in the improvement of surface trans-port in the country. The Imperial Highway Authority (IHA) came into existence in 1951 with the task of maintaining and developing the country’s road network. The Authority was directed by Americans until it got its first Ethiopian manager in 1962. The Imperial Board of Telecommunications, which was set up in 1952, also got sub -\nstantial help from the Americans. The Americans also had considerable influence in shaping the country’s education system. The Ethiopian education system was mod -\neled after the American system of education. The system continued up to the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution. America became the main destination for young Ethiopians who sought higher education. Americans played a tremendous role in the adminis -\ntration of the Haile Selassie I University (now Addis Ababa University). The Peace Corps Program of the 1960s greatly contributed to the education system of Ethiopi-an secondary schools.\nTo conclude, the period following the departure of the British up to the 1974 Ethi-\nopian Revolution might be described as the American era. It should be noted that this American ascendancy in every aspect of Ethiopian life was disliked by many Ethiopians. In particular, students viewed the situation as being within the global framework of American imperialism. Anti-Americanism in Ethiopia was particularly strong in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nLESSON 2\n6.2.

Coffee and other agricultural commodities comprised more than 90 percent of Ethiopia’s exports. Ethiopia has great agricultural potential be-cause of its vast areas of fertile land, diverse climate, adequate rainfall, and large la -\nbor pool. Nevertheless, despite this potential, the country’s agriculture has remained underdeveloped. Several factors can be mentioned for the little advance in Ethiopia’s agriculture. Because of drought, which has persistently affected the country to this day, a poor economic base (low productivity, weak infrastructure, and low level of technology), and government policies (governments’ neglect of the agricultural sec-tor), the Ethiopian agricultural sector has performed poorly. \nActivity 6.11.What are the factors that hinder the development of Ethiopian agriculture?"

            "text": "TextBook\n165Until the 1974 revolution, Ethiopia had a complex land tenure system. There were \ndifferent kinds of land tenure systems in the country. However, the land tenure sys -\ntem can be understood in a rudimentary way if one examines it in the context of \nthe basic distinction between landownership patterns in the north and those in the south. Historically, Ethiopia was divided into the northern highlands, which consti -\ntuted the core of the old Christian kingdom, and the southern highlands, most of which were brought under imperial territorial expansion. This north-south dichot-omy was reflected in land tenure systems. In the Northern provinces, particularly Gojjam, Begemidir, Tigray, Wello, and northern Shewa, the major form of ownership was a type of communal system known as rist. Most peasants in the northern high -\nlands held at least some rist land, but there were some members of minority ethnic groups who were tenant farmers.\nThe other major form of tenure was gult. It was a right acquired from the monarch or \nfrom provincial rulers who were empowered to make land grants. Gult owners col -\nlected tribute from the peasantry and exacted labor service as payment in kind from the peasants. Until the government instituted salaries in the twentieth century, gult rights were the typical form of compensation for an official. Other forms of tenure included samon, mengist, and maderia land. Samon was land which the government had granted to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in perpetuity. The state owned large tracts of land known as mengist and maderia. Mengist was land registered as govern-ment property, and maderia was land granted mainly to government officials, war veterans, and other patriots in the form of a pension or salary.\nThis feudal land tenure system continued to play a negative role in the economic life \nof the peasantry in the post-liberation period. Particularly in this period, there was an acceleration of the process of privatization of land. The landless tenants were few in the northern provinces where the rest system was able to resist the pervasive influence of privatization. However, in the southern provinces, because of the on-going process of privatization, few farmers owned the land on which they worked. The southern landownership patterns developed as a result of land measurement and land grants following the incorporation of the region into the Ethiopian Empire in the late nineteenth century. The gabbar system, in which northern settlers were given tributary rights over southern peasants, enabled the settlers to take over much of the land of the south for themselves through purchase from the impoverished gab-bar or through forcible seizure. Thus, to a large extent, the southern peasants were"

To \nmake matters worse, peasants had no security of tenure because landowners had the right to evict peasants from their land at any time they wanted.\nIn the post-liberation period, side by side with this privatization process, the central \ngovernment issued a series of land-tax decrees. The first decree on land tax that fixed the rate of land tax based on the classification of rural land according to its produc-tivity as cultivated land (lam), semi-cultivated land (lam-taf), and uncultivated land (taf) was issued in 1942. It should be noted that the gasha (equivalent to forty hect-ares) was used as a rate of land measurement. The decrees on land tax raised the tax on measured land from time to time. The new tax laws faced stiff resistance from the rist-holding regions of northern Ethiopia.\nBrainstorming Question\n»How do you describe agricultural development during the Imperial period?\nDuring the imperial period, the development of the agricultural sector was retard-\ned. Agriculture received less than 2 percent of budget allocations even though most of the population depended on it. As a result, agriculture continued to grow below the population growth rate of the country. According to the World Bank, agricultur-al production increased at an average annual rate of 2.l percent between l965 and 1973, while population increased at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent during the same period.\nLater, the imperial government began to give attention to the agricultural sector. \nCommercial agriculture expanded with foreign concessions and government in-volvement. The Tendaho Cotton Plantations and Setiti Humara were good examples of the expansion of commercial farming. Government policy permitting investors to import fertilizers, pesticides, tractors and combiners, and (until 1973) fuel free of import duties encouraged the rapid expansion of large-scale commercial farming. \nAlthough the issue of land reform was not addressed until the l974 Revolution, the \nimperial government made no successful attempts to improve the condition of farm -\ners. In 1971, the Ministry of Agriculture introduced a Minimum Package Program (MPP) sponsored by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) aimed at bringing about economic and social changes. The MPP included credit for the pur -\nchase of inputs such as fertilizers, improved seeds, and pesticides; innovative exten -"

The program, designed for rural devel -\nopment, was first introduced through a project called the Chilalo Agricultural De-velopment Unit (CADU). This program later facilitated the establishment of similar internationally financed projects in the Ada and Wolaita areas.\nBrainstorming Question\n»What was the response of the imperial regime to the increasing demand for land re -\nform?\nChiefly because of pressures from external sponsors, the imperial regime began to \nconsider ‘land reform’ in the early 1960s. In 1961 a committee on land reform was first set up which developed into the Land Reform and Development Authority in 1965, and then to Ministry of Land Reform and Administration in 1966. Neverthe -\nless, no meaningful land reform was made. A tenancy bill was first presented to par-liament in 1964. However, the parliament could not introduce reforms since it repre-sented the interests of the landlords. \nThe suffering of the peasantry from drought, locust invasion and famine forced many \nsectors of Ethiopian society to favor land reform in the mid-1960s. Since 1965, uni-versity students, who were known for their famous slogan ‘Land to the Tiller’, led the land reform movement. During the 1972-74 drought and famine the imperial gov -\nernment did not work hard to assist rural Ethiopians and tried to cover up the crisis. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians lost their lives. By l974 it was clear that the archaic land tenure system was one of the major factors responsible for the backward condition of Ethiopia’s agriculture and the onset of the revolution. \nModernization: Trade and IndustryBrainstorming Questions\n»What were the roles of trade and industry in Ethiopia’s economy?\n»What major development plans were designed to improve the Ethiopian economy?\nTrade and industry played a significant role in the national economy. Since the late \nnineteenth century, coffee has become Ethiopia’s leading cash crop. Despite its many riches and a long history of trading contacts with the outside world, Ethiopia never became a great trading nation. Most Ethiopians despised traders and instead glori-"

In the 1960s, trade constituted only 7 percent of the Gross \nDomestic Products (GDP) whereas the industrial sector represented a very small part of the total economy. For example, in l975 the industrial sector accounted for less than 5 percent of the GDP and employed only about 60,000 people.\nNevertheless, the changes brought by the Italians were limited. In the post-libera-\ntion period, a small proportion of the population participated in the money economy, and there was a low rate of circulation of goods. Wage labor was also limited, eco-nomic units were largely self-sufficient, foreign trade was negligible, and the market for manufactured goods was extremely small. Much of the economy remained un-changed during the late 1940s and 1950s.\nAgricultural products constituted the bulk of the country’s exports. The major ex -\nport items were: coffee, which accounted 50 - 65 percent of the total exports of the \ncountry. Next to coffee, there were also hides and skins, as well as pulses and oil-seeds. On the other hand, the major Ethiopian imports were textiles, machinery, and chemicals. Ethiopia’s foreign trade partners were the USA, which was the major im-porter of the country’s coffee (about 70%), Italy, and Japan. In more broad terms, from 1953 to 1974, the balance of trade registered annual deficits. To improve the trade balance, the government attempted to restrict imports and replace them with locally produced industrial goods to improve the trade balance. Despite these efforts, however, the unfavorable trade balance continued. As a result, foreign grants and loans financed much of the balance of payments deficit.\nThe post-independence period witnessed some continuity and change regarding the \ncountry’s domestic trade. Addis Ababa continued as the commercial centre of the country. But inside Addis, the pre-war commercial center of the city, Arada (renamed by the Italians as Piazza) was replaced by Mercato. In this period, the role of the Greek, Armenian, and Arab traders as economic intermediaries between Ethiopia and the outside world faced a serious challenge from an emerging class of national traders. Even then, a small number of Ethiopians were involved in import and export trade. \nSince the early 1950s, the Ethiopian government has renewed its call for a transition \nfrom a subsistence economy to an agro-industrial economy. A key element of the emperor’s new economic policy was the adoption of centrally administered devel -\nopment plans. In the period between l945 and l957, several technical missions, from"

This was noticeable in the spheres of pro -\nvincial administration, military organization and fiscal control. The imperial state constructed by Haile Selassie was also tenuously held together by a top-heavy, secu-larized bureaucracy and an imperial myth. The architect and symbol of the absolutist order was Emperor Haile Selassie I, who dominated the political life of the Ethiopi-ans from 1930 to 1974. In the period when the emperor continued to exercise abso-lute power, his words were final on important appointments and decisions.\nAfter the restoration of Haile Selassie to the throne in 1941, the Emperor continued \nthe work of creating the bureaucratic machinery of a centralized modern state. He completed the process of destroying the independent political and military power of the feudal aristocracy, which he had started before the Italian invasion. The emperor built a bureaucracy that served only his interests. The emperor exerted all his energy on the maintenance of his power and the elimination of actual and potential politi -\ncal opposition. Although oppressive measures and institutions could not salvage the emperor from downfall, the emperor gave priority for security apparatus and mili-tary organization.\nActivity 6.2\n1.Why did the military eventually turn against the regime and bring its down -\nfall?\nMilitary Organizations \nBrainstorming Questions»What were the measures taken to strengthen the apparatus of coercion?

The Imperial Bodyguard was reorganized with Swedish as-sistance. It was designed to control other army units. It remained as the elite force of the regime until it was dishonored due to its involvment in the aborted coup of 1960. \nThe Police Force was set up in 1942.

It was an \nelaborate intelligence network that spied on the nation and fed the emperor with information. The Department played a vital role in eliminating political oppositions to the regime. \nThe Army, at first trained and armed by the British and later by the Americans, was \nthe pillar of state power. Even though the Army was principally organized with the objective of defending the country from external invasion, it was excessively used for the repression of internal political opposition. The Ministry of Defence and the Department of Public Security consistently got the highest budgetary allocations. \nThe Administrative Divisions\nThe emperor revised the administrative divisions and established political and ad-ministrative offices corresponding to them. This was designed to gain some control over local government by placing it in the hands of the central administration in Ad-dis Ababa. The largest of these administrative units were the provinces (teklay-gi -\nzats), of which there were fourteen in the mid-1960s, each under a governor general appointed directly by the emperor. Each province was subdivided into sub-provinc-es (awrajas), districts (weredas), and sub-districts (mikitil-weredas). The structure outwardly resembled a modern state apparatus. In fact high-ranking landed nobles held all the important offices. Younger and better-educated officials were little more than providing an aide to the governor-generals in the form of advice. \nEducational System \nBrainstorming Question\n»How was the education system of the country designed? \nThe country’s education system was primarily designed to produce the necessary \ntrained manpower for the expanding bureaucracy of the absolutist state. After 1941 secondary schools were opened for the first time. The Haile Selassie I Secondary School and the General Wingate School were opened in 1943 and 1946, respective-ly. Most of the educated elites of the 1950s were products of these two secondary schools. The University College of Addis Ababa was established in 1950. Subsequent -\nly, the Engineering College and the Building College in Addis Ababa, the Alamaya College of Agriculture and the Gondar Public Health College were opened. These col -\nleges were brought together to form the Haile Selassie I University in 1961. Gradu-"

These two institutions elevated the emperor to a superhuman height. Moreover, almost all major landmarks in Addis Ababa bore the name of the emperor. To mention a few: the university, the stadium, the main avenue and square of the city, two schools and a hospital were named after the emperor. Similarly, many institutions in the other parts of the coun -\ntry bore his name. The emperor’s birth and coronation days were celebrated as na -\ntional holidays. In short, not only was the political order dominated by the emperor, but also the country came to be identified with him.\nThe Revised Constitution of 1955\nBrainstorming Questions\n»Why was the constitution revised in 1955? What were the major differences between \nthe revised constitution and the 1931 constitution?\nIn 1955, on the occasion of the silver jubilee of the coronation of Emperor Haile Se-\nlassie, the 1931 constitution was revised and promulgated. The incorporation of Eritrea, which had a more advanced constitution, necessitated the revision of the 1931 constitution. The 1955 revised constitution mainly differed from the 1931 con-stitution in its provision of universal adult suffrage and the provision for an elect-ed Chamber of Deputies. Ethiopia came to have a bicameral parliament, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. The Senate remained appointive, but the Chamber of Deputies was, at least nominally, elected. But popular participation in the election remained very low.\nThe 1955 revised constitution consolidated the absolute powers of the emperor. \nThe major concern and content of the revised constitution was the issue of imperial succession and the power of the emperor. The constitution made the person of the emperor sacred and his power unquestionable. To quote the constitution: “By virtue of His Imperial Blood, as well as of the anointing which he has received, the person of the Emperor is sacred, his dignity is inviolable, and his power is indisputable.” Al -\nthough the constitution contained some elements of human rights, such as personal freedoms and liberties, including freedoms of assembly, movement, speech, and of the press, they were accompanied by invalidating phrases like “in accordance with \nthe law” or “with the limits of the law”."

These were: the Returnees, who had been in exile with the Emperor or on their own; the Collaborators, who had worked with the Italians and held in disrespect among patriotic circles; and the patriots, who had played a major role in the liberation struggle but were in many cases unfamiliar with modern administration. All three groups expected, and to some extent received, posts in government service, as a reward for past services, or in recognition of their influence, or loyalty to the monarch. But it should be noted that the emperor was unwilling or unable to satisfy the interests of the patriots as compared to the other two groups. Indeed, some patriot leaders opposed the restoration of the emperor to the throne after his period of exile. They even viewed the emperor as traitor who deserted the country at the time of its adversity.

Upon the Emperor’s re-\nturn to Ethiopia in 1941, Belay was made governor of a small district in Gojjam with the rank of Dajjach while some patriot leaders who had lesser contribution to the resistance struggle were appointed above him and given higher ranks. But Belay re -\nmained popular among the people of the area. Hence, the suspicious emperor once tried to remove Belay from his power base by appointing him as governor of one of the provinces in southern Ethiopia with the title of Ras. Nevertheless, Belay was unwilling to serve under an emperor, whom he openly criticized as a deserter in the Oppositions to the Imperial Rule \nPlots and Conspiracies"

Bitwodded Menge-sha Jembre, Ras Hailu Belew, Bitwodded Negash Bezabih and other former patriot leaders attacked Belay’s stronghold. After Belay lost most of his followers in three months of fighting, Belay surrendered. It should be noted that his surrender was the result of several weeks of negotiations where Belay surrendered in return for a pardon for himself and his followers. But Belay was soon betrayed. He was taken to Addis Ababa and imprisoned, accused of being a threat to the monarchy. But after a \nfew months, he broke out of jail. But he was caught on his way to Gojjam and then was executed by hanging. This heartbreaking capital panishment on Belay has been remembered as a grave injustice by the imperial government.\nBitwodded Negash Bezabih\nBrainstorming Question\n»Who was Bitwodded Negash Bezabih?\nBitwodded Negash Bezabih was another famous patriot leader in Gojjam. He was \nalso a grandson of Negus Tekle-Haimanot of Gojjam. In the post-liberation decade, Negash served as vice-minister in the Prime Minister’s office and President of the Senate. In 1951, Negash led a conspiracy aimed at assassinating Haile Selassie and establishing a republic under the leadership of Ras Emiru. But Ras Emiru was not involved in the plot. The conspirators chose Ras Emiru because he was a progressive governor before the war and was remembered for his sense of justice. \nThe conspirators were able to approach many governmental officials and some mil-\nitary officers. But the main mistake that the conspirators made was attempting to enlist the support of a patriot leader named Dajjach Geressu Duki. Geressu betrayed the conspirators, and reported their plot. With the approval of the emperor, he began to play a double game until more was known about the conspiracy. Finally, Bitwod -\nded Negash Bezabih and many others were arrested during one of their clandes-tine meetings in Dajjach Geressu’s house by a force commanded by Mengistu Neway. The conspirators were tried at the Emperor’s special court and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment."

Finally, after several plots and imprisonments, his final attempt to assassinate the emperor was uncovered, and Takele was killed in a shoot-out with the police in his house in November 1969.\nThe Attempted Coup of 1960\nBrainstorming Questions\n»Who were the leaders of the coup d’état  of 1960?\n»Who was Germame? What were the major events of the coup?\n»What were the proclaimed aims of the coup makers?\nOpen opposition to the imperial regime surfaced in December 1960 when radical \nintellectuals and some sections of the armed force, who didn’t see the emperor as a leader of reforms but an obstacle for the progress attempted to overthrow him through a coup d’etat. The 1960 attempted coup was organized by two brothers, known in Ethiopian history as the “Neway brothers.” The attempted coup was led by Brigadier General Mengistu Neway, the commander of the Imperial Bodyguard, and his brother Germame Neway. Besides a handful of radical intellectuals, a few top military officials, including the commander of the Security Forces, Colonel Worqneh Gebeyehu and the commander of the Police Force, Brigadier General Tsege Dibu, joined the two brothers.\nGermame, who was the mind and the spirit behind the attempted coup, had a mas-\nter’s degree in political science from Columbia University. Obviously, Germame was able to convince his own brother, Brigadier General Mangistu Neway to stage a coup while the emperor was on a state visit to Brazil. The coup was initially successful in the capital. On the evening of December 13, 1960, the plotters managed to take hostage more than twenty ministers and kept them at Genete Leul Palace (now Ad -\ndis Ababa University main campus) and controlled strategic points in the capital."

Although university students demonstrated in favor of the coup, army and air force units remained loyal to the emperor. The patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church also condemned the coup makers as an-ti-religious traitors and supported the loyalists. Thus, the rest of the military and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church rallied to support the Emperor and by 17 December the coup was aborted.

Increasing state pressure on peasants’ re -\nsources, and ethno-nationalist sentiments are often pointed out as factors behind \nthese rebellions. The condition of the peasantry was extremely miserable. The lives of peasants were severely affected by increasing land taxes, the process of privat-ization and land sales plus the expansion of commercial farms. In the period under discussion major peasant rebellions occurred in Tigray, Bale and Gojjam provinces. \nThe Woyane Rebellion\nBrainstorming Questions\n»Who was the leader of the Woyane rebellion? \nThe first peasant rebellions after liberation occurred in Tigray in 1943. This rebel-\nlion that broke out in Eastern Tigray is known as the “Woyane Rebellion.” Banditry, animosity between the central government and the Azebo and Raya peasants, mal -\nadministration as well as the interests of the regional nobility to exploit the unrest contributed to the rebellion. The Woyane rebellion was led by Blatta Hayle Mariam Redda, whose remarkable leadership is always pointed out as a major factor behind the temporary success of the movement. The course of the Weyane Rebellion was relatively brief. The rebels made some initial victories at Anda Abuna near Mehoni and finally captured Mekelle. But the movement was finally crushed by the imperial forces led by Ras Abebe Aregay, supported by British air force. After the fall of Me -\nkelle in October 1943, all organized resistance collapsed. \nThe Bale Peasant Rebellion\nBrainstorming Questions\n»What was the root cause of the Bale peasant rebellion? In which district did the\nrebellion start?\nThe second and the longest peasant rebellion occurred in the Bale between 1963 and 1970. The rebels were supported by the Somalia government, which had the aim of creating Greater Somalia by incorporating Somali-inhabited neighboring regions of Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti. But the root causes were primarily local discontents over land and tax issues and opposition to Christian settlement in predominantly Muslim Oromo and Somali inhabited areas."

Initially, the rebellion was led by a Somali named Kahin Abdi, but gradually the leadership shifted to an Oromo commander, Waqo Gutu, who was later identified as the symbol of the Bale peasant resistance. It was under the leadership of Waqo that the rebellion became more militant and well organized.\nAt first, the government tried to pacify the province by promising the return of con-\nfiscated land. Nevertheless, the promise didn’t satisfy the rebels, and the revolt con-tinued to spread. The rebels killed two district governors and many government soldiers. They also attacked Goba, the capital of Bale province, two times. Finally, the Bale peasant rebellion was put down by a massive operation, which lasted from 1967 to 1970 and involved the Fourth Division of the Army led by General Wolde-Se-lassie Baraka and General Jagama Kello.\nThe Gojjam Peasant Rebellion\nBrainstorming Questions\n»When did the Gojjam peasants revolt against the government? Why?\nPeasant rebellions in Gojjam can be traced back to the 1940s and 1950s. In these de-\ncades, people successfully resisted pressures from the political center. The peasants of Gojjam refused to go along with government actions such as gun and land registry and the appointment of governors from the center. In the 1950s, when Dajjach Kebe-de Tesemma was made governor of Gojjam, rebellion broke out in Motta, Kolla Dega Damot and Mecha districts. At that time, the peasants successfully resisted land tax increases and land measurement.  This rebellion forced the central government to reduce the new tax rate by a third and to replace Dajjach Kebede with Hailu Belaw, a hereditary governor of Gojjam.\nHowever, a militant and well organized peasant rebellion led by veterans of the re-\nsistance occurred in Gojjam in 1968. At that time, the rebellion involved bandits, local nobles, and peasants. The 1968 rebellion was provoked by the introduction of a new agricultural income tax law and changes in land measurement, and the ar-rogance of the then governor Dajjach Tsehayu Enqu-Selassie. Among other things, Tsehayu forced the people to make contributions to erect the statue of the emperor in the provincial capital, Dabra Markos. To eliminate banditry, Tsehayu also exposed"

He also forced the peasants to pay all \narrears of taxation going back to 1940 and ordered guns registration with charges. Tsehayu also interfered in the affairs of churches and monasteries.\nThe immediate cause of the rebellion was the attempt to introduce the new tax, \nwhich Parliament passed as a tax on agricultural produce in November 1967. The peasants saw the new tax as an attempt to dispossess them from their hereditary rist land. Subsequently, the peasants resisted the tax assessors and sent petitions to the emperor to call off the new tax. When their petition was not accepted, the peasants rebelled. The rebellion was particularly strong in the Motta and Kolla Dega Damot districts. Indeed, for many months, several districts were outside government con -\ntrol. They were administered by rebels who assumed titles like Le’ul and Fitawrari for themselves.\nBrainstorming Questions\n»What was the response of the central government? What were the results of the rebel -\nlion?\nInitially, the response of the central government was indecisive, with commettes sent \nand concessions made before military force was used to restore order. The govern -\nment set up several successive committees to pacify the region. Based on the rec-ommendation of one of these committees, Tsehayu was removed and sent to Kafa Province, two of his arch-rivals were appointed as governors of Motta and Kolla Daga Damot districts, and a general amnesty (pardoning the rebels) was proclaimed. But the revolt continued until it was suppressed by a military campaign involving the army, the police, and the nech lebash. Although the Gojjam peasant rebellion was fi-nally put down by the end of 1968, it was the most successful uprising. The peasants had not lost their causes. Following the suppression of the rebellion, the new tax was abandoned, unpopular officials were removed, and all arrears of taxation going back to 1950 were canceled.\nTo sum up, in the post-liberation period, peasant rebellions also occurred in other \nprovinces, although not on the same scale as the ones discussed above. The peasants of Gedeo and Yajju rebelled and protested land alienation and maladministration. They challenged the autocratic rule of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1960 and 1970, respectively."

It also played a significant role in the demise of the imperial re-gime. Based on the decision of the UN General Assembly, the federation of Eritrea with Ethiopia came into effect in 1952. But the federation formula neither satisfied the unionists nor the separatists. The imperial government also did not want to see the continuation of autonomous Eritrea, which enjoyed some degree of freedom and civic liberties unknown in other parts of the country. Hence, in 1962, following the decision of the Eritrean parliament to dissolve the federation, Eritrea became the 14\nth province of Ethiopia in 1964.  The end of the federation consolidated \ninternal and external opposition to the imperial regime.\nThe first separatist movement was the Eritrean Liberation Movement (ELM). This \nmovement was founded in 1958. It engaged in clandestine political activities against the centralizing policies of the imperial state. However, the ELM had been discovered and disbanded by imperial authorities.\nIn 1960, Eritrean exiles in Cairo founded the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). In \nSeptember 1961, the ELF turned to armed struggle for the independence of Eritrea \nunder the leadership of Hamid Idris Awate. Because of its domination by Muslims, but radical Arab states like Egypt, Syria and Iraq supported the ELF with military and financial assistance. However, division with the ELF led to the formation of new groups. The three major splinter groups were: the Eritrean Liberation Forces in the Barka area; the Popular Liberation Forces (PLF) in the Red Sea area led by Osman Saleh Sabby, and the Front for Eritrean Independence in the Akala Guzay region led by Isayyas Afeworqi.\nBrainstorming Question\n»How was the founder of the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF)?\nIn 1972, the three splinter groups united to form the Eritrean People’s Liberation \nForces (EPLF).

It is considered the origin of \nthe organized quest for Oromo self-identity. It was a self-help club with the modest objective of promoting Oromo self-identity as well as providing educational, water supply, communication, and health facilities in the Oromo inhabited areas. Initially, its membership was not confined to Oromo origins only. But, later, the association began to play political roles, and the regime considered it a threat. It was partic -\nularly alarming when the association managed to win over the commander of the Ethiopian Police Force, Brigadier General Taddesse Birru, who was elected its presi -\ndent. Taddesse appeared at organizational rallies, delivering speeches critical of the government’s policies towards Oromo areas and encouraging the people to demand \njustice.\nA period of tense confrontation between the regime and the association attained its \nclimax in November 1966. The Imperial regime became alarmed at the growth in the movement’s popularity and decided to arrest its top leadership, including Gen -\neral Taddesse Birru, following a bomb explosion in a cinema in Addis Ababa. That was attributed to members of the association. The Mecha-Tulama Self-Help Asso -\nciation was banned shortly thereafter. General Taddesse, who had retreated to the bush, was captured and brought to trial in 1968. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. Mamo Mezemir was also sen-tenced to death and he was executed on February 28, 1969.Taddesse was set free soon after the outbreak of the revolution, but he was executed in early 1975 by the military regime on charges of opposing the land reform proclamation. The inability of the regime to accommodate such a moderate expression of Oromo self-identity subsequently opened the way for a more militant Oromo nationalism. The group that founded the Oromo Liberation Front in 1974 consisted largely of former members of the Mecha-Tulama Self-Help Association."

Particularly beginning from 1965, student demonstrations called for land reform and urged the government to address corruption, rising prices, and various other social, political and economic issues. \nThe Ethiopian student movement was born as a result of the expansion of secondary \nand higher education. In 1950, the University College of Addis Ababa was inaugurat -\ned. In the subsequent years, some colleges and higher learning institutions were also opened, for example, in Harar and Gondar. Moreover, there was a massive expansion of secondary schools in Addis Ababa and provincial cities particularly throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s. \nActivity 6.41. How students were politically active and effective?The Ethiopian student movement went through various phases of development. The \nEthiopian student movement began with specific university grievances, and then rapidly spilled over into a protest movement on much wider issues. During its first phase, in the 1950s, the students mainly demanded improvement in learning facili-ties and services. The major form of student organization at this stage was the stu-dent council. But, since the mid-1960s the students became more militant, and their movement grew into a mass revolution. \nBrainstorming Questions\n•What were the factors that led to the radicalization of the student movement?\n•What were the major national and international issues raised by the students?\nSeveral factors were crucial to transform the movement from passive to active oppo -\nsition.

This can be considered as the second phase of the Ethiopian student movement. \nThe third and the revolutionary phase of the Ethiopian student movement was initi -\nated in the mid-1960s. The birth of a radical core known as the “crocodiles” in 1964 \nplayed an important role in bringing the student movement to its militant phase. This group worked underground and embraced Marxist ideas. The first expression of students’ radical opposition came in February 1965 when Parliament was debat-ing a land reform bill. Students gathered outside the parliament building to demon-strate against the feudal land tenure system under the slogan of “Land to the Tiller!” \nIn 1969, the students raised the most sensitive issue of the multi-ethnic country, \ni.e., the rights of nations and nationalities. From then on, the imperial governmentbegan to take repressive measures against students. On 28 December 1969, TilahunGizaw, the president of the University Students Union of Addis Ababa (USUAA), waskilled near the Sidist Kilo campus. The students removed Tilahun’s body from thehospital and refused to hand it over to the family for burial.

In a parallel devel-opment, the Ethiopian Students’ Union in North America (ESUNA), with its organ Challenge, and the Ethiopian Students’ Union in Europe (ESUE), with its organ Tataq, were founded.

In sympathy with the uprising, the Sig-nal Corps broadcast information about events to the rest of the army. Moreover, by that time, discontent was rampant and led to the outbreak of nationwide protests throughout the country.\nThe revolution found its way to Addis Ababa on February 18, 1974. On that day, op-\nposition to increased fuel prices and curriculum changes in the schools, known as Sector Review, as well as low teachers’ salaries and many other grievances, crys-tallized. The Ethiopian Teachers’ Association, with a membership of about 18,000, went on strike demanding higher pay and better conditions of work, and the suspen-sion of the Education Sector Review. The Sector Review was an educational policy jointly produced by the Ethiopian government and the World Bank to replace the existing educational system. University students and other sections of society joined the demonstration demanding the suspension of the Sector Review.\nAt that same time, taxi-drivers in Addis Ababa withheld their service and joined the \nstrike demanding that they be allowed to raise fares in proportion to the 50% rise in petrol prices introduced following the global oil crisis as a result of the 1973 Ar-ab-Israeli War.

Furthermore, the Derg disbanded the emperor’s governing councils, and national-ized the imperial residence and the emperor’s other landed and business holdings, such as the Anbassa Bus Company and the St. George Brewery. By late August, the emperor had been directly accused of covering up the horrors of the Wello famine of 1973 and 1974, which allegedly killed 100,000 to 200,000 people. After street demonstrations took place urging the emperor’s arrest, the Derg formally deposed Haile Selassie by a proclamation on September 12, 1974, and imprisoned him at the Fourth Division headquarters.\nThe proclamation of September 12, 1974, in addition to deposing the emperor, offi -\ncially suspended the Revised Constitution of 1955, dissolved Parliament, established a Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC), promised a new constitution, prohibited the right to strike and stage demonstrations, and declared any opposition to “Ethiopia Tikdem” (Ethiopia First) illegal.

However, the Derg began to take bloody measures to suppress civilian as well as military opposition. It arrested the leaders of CELU and a leader of the Forum group. On October 7, the Derg crushed dissidents supporting the civilian demands in a bloody assault.\nAn even bloodier phase of the Revolution started on November 23, 1974. General \nAman, who was opposed by the majority of the Derg, was attempting unsuccessfully to appeal directly to the army for support as charges mounted against him within the Derg. He retired to his home and on November 23, was killed while resisting arrest. On the same evening, on what became known as “Bloody Saturday,” 52 senior offi-cials of the old regime and about half a dozen leaders of the military units that had opposed the Derg were executed. The summary execution of these officials, known as the sixty, was the most damaging political blunder of the Derg that discredited it both at home and abroad.\nActivity 6.6\n1.List down some members of the old regime who became victims of “Bloody\nSaturday”.\nFollowing the events of “Bloody Saturday”, Brigadier General Tafari Banti, became Chairman of the PMAC and Head of State on November 28, 1974, but real power was retained by Major Mengistu, who kept his post as First Vice-Chairman of the PMAC, with Major Atnafu as Second Vice-Chairman.

In October 1974, the Derg announced the Development through Co-operation Campaign (known in Amharic as Zemecha), which was launched in De-cember 1974 with the aim of assisting the enforcement of the upcoming land re-form decree. It aimed at mobilizing university and secondary school students and their teachers to the countryside to explain the socialist revolution, including land reform, to peasants and to improve their traditionally low literacy rate. The Zeme -\ncha prepared the groundwork for the introduction of the land reform of 1975. The participants’ contributions to the registration, distribution of lands, and formation of peasants’ associations were immense. On the other hand, the campaigners, particu -\nlarly members of the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Party (EPRP) who infiltrated the campaign, used the Zemecha to incite opposition to the Derg. Hence, the military government was obliged to terminate the Zemecha in June 1976.\nOther similar Zemecha or campaigns were also launched by the Derg to address the \nvarious socio-economic and political problems of the country through mass mo -\nbilization. To mention the major ones: Yearnguadew Zemecha (Green Campaign), declared in 1978 to bring rapid economic development; Yemesrettimhirt Zemecha \n(Literacy Campaign), launched in 1979 to eradicate illiteracy; and Yeqeyi Kokeb Ze-\nmecha (Red Star Campaign), declared in 1982 to solve the Eritrean problem once and for all through military means. Of these campaigns, only literacy campaign en -\nabled the Derg to achieve some success."

As if to gain the support of the students, the Derg began to change its slogan from “Ethiopia Tikdem” (Ethiopia First) to “Ethiopian Socialism” as the political philosophy of the nation. In keeping with its declared socialist path, the Derg announced that all royal titles were revoked, and that the proposed consti-tutional monarchy was abandoned in March 1975. \nBrainstorming Question\n»What were the two radical proclamations of the PMAC?\nThe year 1975 began with a series of proclamations that brought most of Ethiopia’s \nindustries, large-scale agricultural farms, and financial institutions under the control of the government. The economic and social basis of feudo-capitalism were disman -\ntled and replaced by a socialist socio-economic order. Both rural and urban com -\nmunities were organized into a hierarchy of associations. In March 1975, the PMAC issued a radical land reform proclamation, Nationalization of Rural to dismantle the socio-economic basis of feudalism. The proclamation abolished all private land own -\nership and set the ceiling on family holdings at ten hectares. It also provided for the formation of peasant associations. The peasant associations at village, district, and provincial levels would be in charge of the implementation of the proclamation in cooperation with the zemecha.\nThe next radical measure taken by the Derg nationalized all urban land and extra \nhouses. Kebeles were also formed after the nationalization of all urban land and rentable dwellings. Like peasant associations in the countryside, kebeles were the basic unit of urban government and served as instruments of socio-political control of urban areas.\nBrainstorming Questions\n»What was the Union of Marxist-Leninist Organizations (Emaledeh)?

These organizations, except for the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Party or EPRP (Amharic: Ehapa), joined the revolution, perhaps with the hope of snatching the leadership from the PMAC. On the other hand, the PMAC regarded the partnership with leftist organiza-tions as a calculated move to diffuse their opposition to its rule.\nTherefore, each having its own hidden agenda, made tacit agreement and formed the \nUnion of Marxist-Leninist Organizations (Amharic acronym was Emaledih) in early 1977. The task of the front was to identify strategies for the creation of a vanguard party. Member organizations of Emaledeh were: The All-Ethiopian Socialist Move-ment (Amharic acronym was Meison); the Workers’ League (Amharic acronym was Wezlig), the Ethiopian Marxist-Leninist Organization (Amharic acronym was Maler-id), the Ethiopian Oppressed Masses Revolutionary Struggle (Amharic acronym was Echa’at), and Abyotaw Seded (Revolutionary Flame), which was launched by Mengis -\ntu and his close supporters.\nHowever, the Derg seemed hesitant to permit free and open political competition. \nThe Derg also continued to use extreme measures against its real and perceived op -\nponents to ensure its survival. At first, Meison left the union, and its leaders were either killed or arrested as they tried to retreat to the countryside, most probably to launch an armed struggle against the PMAC. In the end, as the three other mem-ber organizations: Echa’at, Wezlig and Malerid) were successfully expelled from Em-aledih and, their leaders and members were executed or detained. Hence, by early 1979, Mengistu’s Abyotawi Seded stood alone as the only officially recognized polit -\nical organization; the others were branded enemies of the revolution.\nThe strategy of a vanguard party formation also shifted from the merger of political \norganizations to the recruitment of individuals loyal to Mengistu. Hence, the Derg formed the Commission for Organizing the Party of the Workers of Ethiopia (COP -\nWE) in December 1979, with Mengistu as its chairman. Finally, the Workers’ Party of Ethiopia (WPE) was proclaimed on September 12, 1984, when the tenth anniversary of the revolution was celebrated. As you might expect, Mengistu Haile Maryam be-came the party’s first secretary-general.\nSide by side with the formation of the vanguard party, politicizing and organizing \nthe people were actively pursued.

This action gave the regime even greater and more direct control over the various sectors of soci -\nety. In this regard, the regime took its first step by eliminating the Confederation of Ethiopian Labor Unions (CELU) in favor of the government-controlled All-Ethiopia Trade Union (AETU) in early 1977. Control of the peasants was ensured through the All-Ethiopia Peasants’ Association (AEPA), later renamed the Ethiopian Peasants’ Association (EPA). Similarly, women and youth of the country between the ages of 14-30 were organized into a Revolutionary Ethiopian Women’s Association (REWA)and a Revolutionary Ethiopian Youth Association (REYA) in 1980. Other professionalorganizations were formed at a national level. In short, there was no citizen who didnot belong to a mass organization, a professional association, or both.\nBrainstorming Question\n»What was the People’s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE)?\nThe culmination of the Ethiopian revolution was the proclamation of the People’s \nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) in September 1987. At first, an Institute for the Study of Nationalities, with the aim of drafting a constitution, was established. The Institute made a socio-cultural survey of the entire country. Then, a constitution drafting commission, was established with the power to draft a constitution head-ed by Mengistu. The commission finally submitted the draft constitution to public ‘debate’ and it was ratified by “referendum” in February 1987. The drafting and the referendum were followed by the drama of electing members of the supreme body, i.e., the National Shengo. As Bahru put it: “In a ‘race’ that was entirely a family affair,favored WPE candidates, who were appropriately given the emblem of the invincibleelephant, were elected to be the Shango.”\nThe founding congress of the Shengo issued a proclamation that formally estab -\nlished the People’s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) on September 11, 1987. \nDespite these changes, members of the now-defunct Derg still ran the government, but with different titles. For example, the National Shengo elected Mengistu to be the country’s first civilian president; he remained, however, the WPE’s general secretary. \nResettlement and Villagization\nBrainstorming Questions"

What have you heard about the policy ofvillagization?\nThe Derg implemented various misguided policy measures, which made the govern-ment unpopular and precipitated the downfall of the regime. Of these misguided policies, we will discuss forced resettlement and villagization.\nThe 1984/85 famine was the first signs that danger was creeping against the mili-\ntary regime. It was more severe than the 1973/74 famine which brought the Derg to power. The famine affected nearly eight million people and killed about one million. \nBeginning in the late 1970s Ethiopia suffered from a series of droughts, which pro -\ngressively lowered agricultural production. The famine was a clear manifestation of \nthe failure of the regime’s economic policy, particularly in the sphere of agricultural production and marketing. \nAt first, the government turned its blind eye to the famine until the celebration for \nthe formation of WPE and the tenth anniversary of the revolution was over. Finally, in October 1984, after the end of the celebration, the government declared a state of emergency acknowledging the severity of the famine. Finally, the concerned action of the Ethiopian people and the international donor community was able to contain the worst tragedy. \nThe government embarked on forced resettlement and villagization in the mid-1980s \nas part of a national program to combat drought, avert famine, and increase agri -\ncultural productivity. Resettlement, the regime’s long-term solution to the drought problem, involved the permanent relocation of about 1.5 million people from the drought-prone areas of the north to the south and southwest, where population was relatively sparse and so-called virgin, arable land was plentiful. \nAt first, development specialists seemed to agree with the need for resettlement of \nfamine victims in Ethiopia. But once the process was started, there followed a wide-spread criticism saying that the scheme was poorly planned and haphazardly exe-cuted. Moreover, critics charged that the government forcefully relocated peasants and breaking up thousands of families in the process. Thousands also died of malaria and sleeping sickness because of poor sanitation and inadequate health care in new -\nly settled areas. Under an ill-planned resettlement program, 100,000 people died. Some sources voiced suspicion that the regime’s primary motive in resettlement was"

Resettlement, the ar-\ngument went, would reduce the guerrillas’ base of support.\nThe villagization program, the regime’s plan to transform rural society, started in \nearnest in January 1985. If completed, the program might have uprooted and relo-cated more than 30 million peasants over a nine-year period. The regime’s rationale for the program was that the existing arrangement of dispersed settlements made it difficult to provide social services and to use resources, especially land and water, efficiently. The relocation of the peasants into larger villages (with forty to 300 fam -\nilies) would give rural people better access to amenities such as agricultural exten-sion services, schools, clinics, water, and electricity cooperative services and would strengthen local security and the capacity for self-defense. Improved economic and social services would promote more efficient use of land and other natural resources and would lead to increased agricultural production and a higher standard of living. More specifically, the Ethiopian government perceived villagization to hasten agri-cultural collectivization. \nHowever, the decision on villagization was not favorable. Thousands of people fled to \navoid villagization; others died or lived in deplorable conditions after being forcibly resettled. There were indications that in the short term, villagization may have fur-ther impoverished an already poor peasantry. The services that were supposed to be delivered in new villages, such as water, electricity, health care clinics, schools, trans -\nportation, and agricultural extension services, were not being provided because the government lacked the necessary resources. Villagers therefore resorted to impro -\nvised facilities or reverted to old ways of doing things. Villagization also reduced the productive capacity of the peasants by depriving them of the opportunity for inde -\npendent organization and action. By increasing the distance peasants had to travel to work on their land and graze their cattle, villagization wasted time and effort. Denied immediate access to their fields, the peasants were also prevented from guarding their crops from birds and other wild animals. The bitterest critics of villagization argued that regime’s objective in villagization was control of the population. Larger villages would facilitate the regime’s control over the population, cut rebels off from peasant support, and discourage dissident movements. \nLesson 6\n6.6.

What do youknow about the struggle between the Derg and EPRP?\nThe years 1976 and 1977 turned out to be turning points in the history of the Rev -\nolution and the fate of the PMAC. A power struggle broke out in the center, which finally eliminated Mengistu’s political rivals. Moreover, the Ethiopian People’s Rev -\nolutionary Party (EPRP), which consistently demanded that the Derg should relin -\nquish power to a broad-based provisional government, intensified its attack against the Derg, and its challenge attained its climax. In the north, the Eritrean insurgents who demanded an independent Eritrea encircled the capital, Asmara. Besides, a pro-monarchist organization, the Ethiopian Democratic Union (EDU), was advanc -\ning from the Sudan to Satit-Humara region. In the East, Somalia invaded Ethiopia in 1977 to promote its irredentist interest in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia.\nAt first, the leftist groups inside Ethiopia presented a united front in their opposition \nto the PMAC.

Particularly after the PMAC had issued the land reform \nproclamation, Meison entered a strategic alliance with the government by adopting a policy of what it called “critical support.” But the alliance between the Derg and Meison did not last long. It should be noted that the Provisional Office for Mass Orga-nization and Affairs (POMOA), which was established with the aim of disseminating Marxism-Leninism among the masses in 1976, was staffed mainly by members of Meison. In collaboration with the government, Meison organized the Kebeles and the peasant associations. The fact that it soon began to operate in these grassroots or -\nganizations independently was considered a threat to the Derg’s dominance of local governments throughout the country. Hence, the Derg began to attack Meison.\nThe EPRP challenged the Derg’s control of the revolution itself by agitating for a \nbroad-based democratic government run by civilians, not by the military. The strug-gle between the EPRP and the Derg and its allies became a real civil war. It could be said to have started in September 1976 with the arrest and execution of EPRP mil-itants by the Derg and the assassinations of Derg supporters by EPRP squads. The latter included an attempt on the life of Colonel Mengistu, on September 23, 1976. The EPRP conducted urban guerrilla warfare against the regime, referred to as the “White Terror.” The government also waged war against EPRP and other political opponents with its own “Red Terror” campaign. During the “Red Terror,” government security forces systematically hunted down and killed suspected EPRP members and their supporters, especially students. Between 1977 and 1978, an estimated 100,000 people suspected of being enemies of the government were killed or disappeared in the name of the “Red Terror”.\n6.4.

The ideological \nand power struggles of the period came to divide the Derg within itself. In the sum -\nmer of 1976, Mengistu succeeded in liquidating some powerful members of the Derg and potential rivals for power and influence. The first victims included Major Sisay Habte, who was chairman of the Political and Foreign-Affairs Committee of the PMAC, Lieutenant Bewketu Kassa, member of the PMAC and assistant to the Major, Major Kiros Alamayahu, member of the PMAC and chief of the Zemecha, and Brigadier-Gen -\neral Getachew Nadew, the Commander of the Second Division of the Army in Eritrea.\nIn addition, Mengistu was also able to eliminate other prominent members of the \nDerg who tried to restructure the Derg and marginalize Mengistu. Finally, differenc-es of views in the PMAC on measures to be taken in dealing with the EPRP , EDU, and ELF culminated in the palace coup of February 3, 1977. While a meeting of the Central Committee was in session, Colonel Daniel Asfaw, accompanied by security guards, burst into the meeting and arrested General Teferi Benti, Chairman of the PMAC; Lieutenant-Colonel Asrat Desta, Chairman of the Information and Public Re-lations Committee of the PMAC; Lieutenant-Colonel Hiruy Haile Selassie, member of the PMAC; Captain Alemayahu Haile, Secretary-General of the PMAC; Captain Moges Wolde-Michael, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the PMAC; Captain Tefera Deneke and Corporal Hailu Belai, both members of the PMAC. All these key members of the PMAC were taken away and ruthlessly executed.\nFollowing the establishment of his supremacy through the elimination of General \nTafari Benti, Mengistu declared himself the Derg’s chairman in February 1977 and thereafter took steps to protect and enlarge his power base. In November 1977, At-nafu Abaate, Mengistu’s last rival in the Derg, was eliminated, leaving Mengistu in undisputed command. The coup also gave Mengistu and his civilian leftist allies a free hand to unleash what they called the “Red Terror” against what they labeled “re -\nactionaries” and “anarchists”. The terms “reactionaries” and “anarchists” were also interpreted to include anyone who opposed the policies of the regime and the modes of its implementation.

Instead, he encoun-tered a number of internal and external factors that eventually brought his downfall. \nBrainstorming Question\n»What was the global change that affected the regime by the end of the 1980s?\nTowards the end of the 1980s, the Soviet Union, driven by Mikhail Gorbachev’s glas-\nnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring), changed its policies toward its al -\nlies among the developing countries. The implications of this new policy for Ethiopia were likely to be profound, as continued high levels of military assistance were vital to the pursuit of Mengistu’s military solution in Eritrea as well as to the fight against other internal insurgencies. Above all, Gorbachev’s policies brought about the col -\nlapse of the Soviet Union. The United States, which had never been friendly with the Derg, now became the sole undisputed global power. Although Mengistu now tried to improve relations with the Americans, they were more prepared to listen to his opponents, the EPLF and TPLF, than to him. The mounting internal and international pressures exerted on the government to change its political orientation and econom -\nic system, i.e., to declare a mixed economic policy in March 1990.\nNevertheless, by 1989, it was evident that the government had failed to reassert its \nrule. Furthermore, the regime not only was unable to control the general population, but also dozens of top-ranking officials had defected to the West, where they bitterly denounced the government. With military morale at its lowest point, disaffected se-nior officers attempted a coup d’état in May 1989. The arrest and execution of most of the generals, following the aborted coup d’état, deprived the various armed forc-es of their experienced leadership. To make matters even worse for the regime, the balance of power changed in favor of the numerous opposition groups who waged military campaigns against the government.\nBrainstorming Question\n»Can you mention some of the armed organizations that fought against the Derg?"

To mention some of these armed groups: the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), the Oromo Islamic Front, the Afar Liberation Front, the Sidama Liberation Front, the Beni Shangul Liberation Front, and the Gambella Liberation Front. But the most vigorous opposition came from the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) and the Tigray People’s Libera -\ntion Front (TPLF). The two fronts severely tested the regime and greatly contributed to its final downfall.\nBrainstorming Question»What were the major defeats that the Derg suffered in the north?\nThe northern insurgency began to take a decisive turn in March 1988. In that same \nmonth, the routed a formidable force, named the Nadew Command. Subsequently, the town of Afabet, with its military stores, fell to the EPLF. In February 1990, the EPLF mounted a major drive aimed at capturing the port city of Massawa, the entry point for much of the food and military supplies coming into Eritrea. It had overrun the city, dealing a decisive blow to the government army. After the capture of Massa -\nwa, it was apparent that it was only a matter of time before the capital, Asmera, fell to the EPLF. \nAnother decisive blow to the military regime came from the TPLF. The history of \nthe Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) traced back to 1975. Initially, the Derg didn’t consider TPLF as a major threat to the regime and didn’t pay attention to it. In its early years, the TPLF was also characterized by internal struggles until it began to consolidate in the mid-1980s. In the 1980s, when the Derg launched an offensive against TPLF, the latter succeeded in repulsing the offensive. The TPLF also began to capture several small towns in western and central Tigray. In February, the TPLF captured Enda Sellase. After controlling the entire Tigray region, it began operations in surrounding regions. \nAt that same time, the TPLF abandoned its initial objective of establishing a republic \nin Tigray and decided to liberate the whole of Ethiopia by merging with several other opposition groups. A broader front known as the Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), was established. The founding member organizations that gathered under the umbrella of the EPRDF were: TPLF, the Ethiopian Peo -"

In the meantime, faced with economic problems and shortages of military supplies, the government was forced to consider a political solution to its problems. The Ethi-opian national assembly called for unconditional peace talks with the EPLF in June 1989, and later agreed to similar talks with the EPRDF. But, it was too late. Negoti-ations for the peaceful end of the conflict were held in Atlanta, Nairobi, and Rome. Even as these talks proceeded, the opposition forces acquired more and more terri -\ntory. It was at a time when the last of these negotiations were being held in London, in May 1991, that a series of dramatic events that precipitated the end of the Mengis-tu regime unfolded. On 21 May 1991 Mengistu fled the country for Harare, Zimba-bwe. Finally, on 28 May, EPRDF forces triumphantly entered Addis Ababa. The EPLF also took complete control of Eritrea and announced the de facto independence of Eritrea. \nUnit Summary\nBritish involvement in the liberation campaign enabled them to have a dominanat in Ethiopia. They were in control of the most important bodies of government, like the police force, finance, the army, and key posts in the administrative sector, and had occupied Eritrea and the Ogaden. After a long diplomatic struggle, the British restored the entire Ogaden region to Ethiopia in 1954. British occupation of Eritrea also ended in 1951 and Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia in 1952.\nAgriculture, which accounted for over 60 percent of the Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP) and 80 percent of the labor force, remained the most important sector of the Ethiopian economy in the post-liberation period. Rist continued to prevail in the northern provinces, but in the south, the major form of tenure was gult. Trade and industry played insignificant role in the national economy."

The Emperor dominated the political life of the country for more than half a century. Nevertheless, the Emper-or encountered opposition that came from various sections of society and expressed itself in various forms, such as plots and conspiracies, attempted coups, peasant re-bellions, student movements, and armed struggle.\nMore threateningly for the regime, the various military units and contingents started \nto unite their actions by establishing a coordinating committee of the armed forces, which became a precursor of the Derg. On June 28, about 120 junior officers, none above the rank of major, established the Derg (a Ge’ez word for “committee”). Al -\nthough the Derg professed loyalty to the emperor, it immediately began to arrest members of the aristocracy, military, and government who were closely associated with the old order. This became the first step of the “creeping coup” by which the imperial system of government was slowly dismantled. The Derg formally deposed Emperor Haile Selassie on September 12, 1974, and transformed itself into the Pro-visional Military Administrative Council (PMAC).\nLater, the Derg began to change its slogan from “Ethiopia Tikdem” (Ethiopia First) \nto “Ethiopian Socialism” as the political philosophy of nation. The year 1975 began with a series of proclamations that brought most of Ethiopia’s industries, large-scale agricultural farms, and financial institutions under the control of the government. Of the proclamations the most radical were: the nationalization of rural land and the state ownership of urban land and extra houses. The culmination of the Ethiopi-an revolution was the proclamation of the People’s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) in September 1987. By the end of 1980s, the Soviet Union, in the spirit of Mikhail Gorbachev’s glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring), brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union. The United States, which had never friendly relations with the Derg, now became the sole supreme power of international affairs. The northern insurgency began to take a decisive turn in March 1988.

In West Africa, political independence was achieved with relative ease. The main possible reason for this was that West Africa had no significant number of white settlers. Moreover, the nationalist movements in West Africa had a long history and relatively better experience that could enable them to provide leadership and facilitate the struggle for independence. \nNationalist agitation in British West Africa was especially strong in the Gold Coast \n(Ghana) and Nigeria.

The nationalists of the Gold Coast accused \nBritish officials of trying to keep their rule in West Africa by claiming to train Africans in the management of a modern state. As a result of nationalist pressure in the Gold Coast and Nigeria, the African nations of West Africa were able to gain full political independence. In March 1957, the Gold Coast achieved independence, adopting the new name Ghana. Nigeria followed suit in October 1960, while Sierra Leone became independent in April 1961 and Gambia achieved independence in February 1964.\nAfter the end of the Second World War, France came to realize the need to grant more \npolitical and civil rights to its colonial peoples of French West Africa. In the begin -\nning, the French government was not ready to grant full independence to its colonies in Africa. It rather wanted to give the colonies only rights as part of an association with France itself. Accordingly, France introduced reforms and allowed each colony in French West Africa, to elect a territorial assembly.

Meanwhile, radical nationalists \nbegan to demand unconditional full independence.\nIn 1958, General Charles de Gaulle became French President, and a new French con -\nstitution was issued in the same year. In the new constitution, Charles de Gaulle in -\ntended to transform the French Union into a French Community. It was planned that \neach colony in French West Africa would hold a referendum on the new constitu -\ntion. They were to choose between voting “Yes” and becoming autonomous republics within the French Community or voting “No” and becoming immediately indepen-dent outside the French Community. According to de Gaulle, those who choose “No” would lose French economic and technical assistance.\nThe economies of the French West African colonies were highly dependent on \nFrench assistance. Voting “No” seemed dangerous to many colonies. Because of this, almost all colonies voted “Yes”. Only Guinea voted “No” and became fully indepen-dent in 1958. Other colonies in French West Africa also became autonomous within the French Community. Meanwhile, France immediately recalled all its professionals and technical assistants from Guinea and stopped other assistance to Guinea. Never-theless, Sekou Toure, the first president of Guinea, turned to the Soviets. The U.S.S.R. soon responded favorably and filled all the gaps created by the French withdrawal. But the Soviet advance worried France very much. At the same time, leaders of other colonies in French West Africa began to demand full independence. By November 1960, all French West African colonies had achieved full independence. Except for \nGuinea, all of them maintained their close ties with France.  They were Cameroon, \nTogo, Dahomey (now Benin), Niger, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), Ivory Coast, Chad, Ubangi Shari (Central African Republics), Middle Congo (Republic of Congo–Brazzaville), Gabon, Senegal, French Sudan (Mali) and Mauritania.

In Algeria, there were large numbers of white settlers known as colons (or colonists). In 1960, the number of white settlers living in Algeria was around one million. These white settlers used to consider Algeria as part of France. Until the end of the Second World War, many of the Algerian elites, including Ferhat Abbas, considered Algeria as part of France. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm shown for French nationalism, began to decline. Ferhat and others beagn to demand independence. But the colons fought to the finish to resist the struggle for Algerian independence. Therefore, the Algerian freedom fighters had to fight one of the bloodiest wars of independence not only against the French government but also the white settlers in Algeria.\nThe Algerian War of Independence began in November 1954. The leaders of the Al-\ngerian War of Independence were mainly former soldiers of the French army and Algerians of peasant origin. One of the leaders of the struggle for independence was Ben Bella, who eventually became the first President of independent Algeria.

In 1959, Charles de Gaulle offered the Algerians three alterna-tives, namely: integration with France, absolute independence from France, or inde-pendence in cooperation with France. The FLN officially declared that it was in favor of absolute independence. The white settlers in Algeria were against this decision by the FLN. In 1960, the colons and some French generals attempted to overthrow Charles de Gaulle. In both Algeria and France, they established a terrorist organiza-tion known as the Secret Army, which targeted all those who supported the indepen-dence of Algeria. Finally, the French government decided to begin negotiations with the FLN. Accordingly, on March 18, 1962, France and the FLN concluded the Evian Agreement, which brought an end to the Algerian war of independence. On July 1, 1962 Algeria became an independent state.\nLESSON 27.2. \nPolitics in Independent African States\nCompetencies\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to: \nAssess the major political, economic and social problems of independent Af-\nrican states.\nsketch the political map of independent African states,\ndiscuss the role of the military in the politics of politically independent Africa;and\nAppreciate what Africa has achieved so far in terms of political, economic andsocial progress.\nMost of the French-speaking states, with the notable exception of Guinea, Senegal, and Cote d’Ivore, went over to military rule during the 1960s. Togo and Dahomey (Benin) have suffered from frequent military coups and counter-coups. From No -\nvember 1965, coup followed coup with frightening regularity, taking Nigeria and Ghana in early 1966. By the early 1970s, military rule had become a serious African political option. Coup d’état remained the most frequent means of changing govern -\nment throughout the 1970s and 1980s."

But the first army coup of \nJanuary 1966 was followed by another in July amid fears of ethnic domination by Igbo Southerners or Hausa Northerners. The massacre of 20,000 Igbo people living in the northern region led directly to the Biafra secession and subsequent civil war of 1967–70. It was thus that General Gowon, who had seized power in the counter-coup of 1966, steered Nigeria through the consequences of its political inheritance, which squabbling multi-party civilian politicians had done nothing to improve.\nThough General Gowon achieved a remarkable level of post-war reconciliation, \nduring the early 1970s, his government grew increasingly inefficient and divorced from the needs of the country. This led to his overthrow by General Murtala Mu-hammed in July 1975. Muhammed restored moral authority to the government. He embarked on a series of serious reforms of the administration and set a timetable for a return to civilian rule in 1979. Nevertheless, this popular and widely respect-ed military leader was assassinated by a group of envious middle-ranking officers in February 1976. Their attempted coup was actually foiled and General Obassanjo took power. General Obassanjo continued Murtala Mohammed’s reforming policies and returned the country to civilian rule in 1979.\nSimilarly, in Ghana, corruption, extravagant spending, and intolerance of criticism \nled to the overthrow of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah in February 1966. Nkrumah had been blamed by the Ghanaian people for giving priority to external affairs and ignoring the serious economic problems of his own country. But there were also specific military grievances that led to the February 1966 coup.\nPresident Kwame Nkrumah was forced into exile in Guinea, and his political sup-\nporters were purged from the civil service. However, the government of the veteran “Gold Coast” politician, Dr. Kofi A. Busia, proved quite unable to solve the mounting economic problems of Ghana in the face of a further sharp fall in the world price of cocoa. Therefore, another coup was staged in 1972 by Colonel Ignatius Acheam-pong. Though unable to halt Ghana’s overall economic decline, Acheampong’s noted achievement was “Operation Feed Yourself,” which was aimed at reducing Ghana’s dependence on expensive food imports. But it was not adequate. Ghana, like most other African countries, was hit hard by the huge rise in oil prices in 1973–74. Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings seized power in 1979. Three former military heads of state were executed for corrupt practices, and the country returned to civilian rule within three months. Once again, the new civilian government was not urgently and"

The major problem in the economy of Africa has been a lack of diversity. Throughout the colonial period, Africans were encouraged only to produce raw ma-terials for export. The colonial regimes made little effort to establish factories that would produce manufactured goods. The colonies were made producers of mineral ores for the industries of Europe. In the field of agriculture, Africans were encour -\naged to specialize in single cash-crop products. The price of such single products in world markets has not been stable. Moreover, their prices were sometimes fixed in the metropolitan countries in accordance with the interests of international monop-olies. Thus, whenever prices of such products fell on the world market, African states"

Furthermore, the two major factors stifling African development in the 1980s and 1990s were internation-al debt and drought. Thus, the political legacy of colonial rule has a great impact on the development of African countries.\nStruggle for Economic Independence \nIn economic terms, the performance of many African countries has fallen far short \nof the vision of the leaders of anti-colonial movements. For example, in 1985, 22 countries could not feed their growing populations. Agricultural production in the first part of the 1980s had declined.

The Soviets approached the African continent with a clear anti-\nimperialist ideology. Initially, the US generally deferred to its European allies. It \nwas when the Europeans failed that the USA became much more visibly involved. Neither super -power simply allowed African nationalism to take its course. On \ntheir part, African leaders often looked abroad for support against internal factions or external ene-mies.\nGamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt was the first African ruler to develop an interest in \nSoviet support. Egypt became the point of entry when Nasser sought weapons from \nthe W est, which was pro-Israel and refused to sell arms to Egypt. The Soviets agreed \nto build the high Aswan Dam and then backed Egypt during the Suez crisis of 1956. Then Sekou Toure of Guinea followed the example of Nasser and began to look east-ward. When Guinea was expelled from the French fold in 1958, the Soviets were \nprompt to supply arms to Guinea.\nThe assassination of Lumumba and the ideological cleavage over the Congo led other \ngovernments, like Mali, Ghana, and Algeria to seek Soviet support. Of course, the So-viet Union’s highest priority was the establishment of a diplomatic presence. In fact, the Soviets had a working relationship with pro-western states like Senegal, Nigeria, and even monarchic Ethiopia.\nThroughout the 1960’s, pro-Soviet African leaders were removed from power. Ben \nBella was overthrown in 1965, Nkrumah in 1966, and Keita in 1968. Sekou Toure drifted back to France. By the end of the decade, the Soviet Union’s most active allies were moderate African governments that wanted Soviet arms. Over the next decade, the Soviet Union established itself as the world’s leading arms dealer in sub-Saharan Africa. From about $2 million in 1974, Soviet arms sales to Africa rocketed to$3.4 \nbillion in 1979. The collapse of Portuguese colonialism ushered in this new era of Soviet involvement in continental affairs. Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and Angola have joined the socialist camp.\nThe scale of the Soviet commitment in Angola went well beyond its previous engage-\nments.

Lying on the Red Sea route from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, the Horn constitutes the southern periphery of the Middle East. Somalia appeared well on its way to becoming the major Soviet client in Black Afri-ca until the coup in Ethiopia revised this outlook. As the Derg embraced Socialism, the Soviets changed camps. From 1977 to 1980, Ethiopia received nearly $2 billion worth of arms. Both Somalia and Ethiopia provided naval bases for the Soviet Union, Berbera and Dahlak, respectively. But, Siad Barre expelled the Soviets from Soma -\nlia in November 1977 after thier enormous supply of arms to Ethiopia. For some time, Egypt was by far the major recipient of Soviet arms. Libya’s Mohammed Gadaffi armed his military with Soviet equipment.\nThe major U.S. involvement during the 1960s was in Ethiopia. Between 1953 and \n1977, Ethiopia had been a major recipient of U.S. economic and military aid. After the coming to power of the Derg military regime in 1974, the relations between Ethiopia and the USA deteriorated and Ethiopia became the number one Soviet arms client in black Africa. In the meantime, the U.S. established a better link with Somalia. U.S. policy in the Horn was designed to contain Soviet influence. Soviet-U.S. efforts to easing tension in Africa was shaken first by the conflict over Angola and then by the Ogaden War.\nAmerican relationship with Egypt changed dramatically under Sadat, following \nEgypt’s defeat in the 1973 Yom Kippur War with Israel. Sadat needed U.S. support to achieve his aims in the Sinai, and the U.S. poured in military and economic aid. The Camp David Agreement between Egypt and Israel in 1979 made the U.S. com-mitment even stronger. Whereas the US government had bad relations with Libya. Gaddafi’s hostility to Israel stood against U.S. policy. His support and involvement in international terrorism prompted Reagan to approve a plan to overthrow Gaddafi and conduct an air strike in 1986.

Angola and Mozambique had significant numbers of white settlers. Liberation movements in the Portuguese colonies started in the early 1960s. The liberation struggles in Angola commenced in 1961, in Portuguese Guinea in 1963, and in Mozambique in 1964. The resistance movements in Angola and Mozambique were very strong. The Angolan war of in-dependence was led by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and in Mozambique by the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). Agostino Neto was the leader of the MPLA. Eduardo Mondlane led FRELIMO, until he was killed in 1969 and succeeded by Samora Machel. From the outset, the liberation movements in Angola and Mozambique were led and supported by Marxists who organized the freedom fighters. The movements also enjoyed foreign support: MPLA from Guinea and FRELIMO from Tanzania and later Zambia. Portugal sent in more and more troops, who were supported by white mercenaries from the west and the Republic of South Africa.\nAs the war of independence continued, it became a heavy burden on the Portuguese \neconomy. In the early 1970s, the Portuguese had to spend about 40 percent of their government’s revenue on the armed forces. Consequently, Portugal began to face a political crisis at home. In 1973, Guinea made a unilateral declaration of indepen-dence. Meanwhile, violence in Mozambique was mounting. Furthermore, radical elements in the Portuguese army called for an immediate end to the colonial em-pire. Now the Portuguese had no option but to grant independence to their colonies. Therefore, they recognized the independence of Guinea as the Republic of Guinea Bissau. Mozambique gained its independence in June 1975 and Samora Machel be-came the first President of Mozambique.

The result was a power struggle between the MPLA and its political rival, the National Front for the Liberation of An-gola (UNITA). In early 1976, an independent Angolan People’s Republic was set up under Agostino Neto’s MPLA government. But the newly established MPLA govern-ment had to fight against its opponents, particularly Jonas Savimbi’s UNITA.

The constitution was approved by Parlia -\nment in November, and on March 2, 1970, Rhodesia declared itself a republic.\nUnsuccessful negotiations with Britain continued. A 1971 proposal to lessen restric-\ntions on the opposition led to the creation of a third nationalist movement, the Unit-\ned African National Council (UANC), led by the Methodist bishop Abel Muzorewa. \nUnlike the previous two parties, i.e., ZAPU and ZANU—both banned and operating \nonly from exile in Zambia and Mozambique, respectively—UANC was able to orga-\nnize inside Rhodesia and held talks with the government during the 1970s.

The Zambia-Rhodesia border was closed in 1973, but Mozambican inde-pendence in 1975 provided a valuable base of operations for ZANU, which had close links to the FRELIMO government.\nThe White Rhodesian government was thus under diplomatic, military, and, econom-\nic pressure to settle. The 1976 rapprochement between Nkomo, the leader of the ZAPU party, and Mugabe, of ZANU led to the formation of the Patriotic Front (PF), which received frontline support from Rhodesia’s majority-ruled neighbours. The fighting escalated in both areas. By 1979 the combination of pressures had forced Smith to accept the necessity of an “internal settlement.”\nThe 1978 agreement had promised elections for a transitional government. The \nUANC won a clear majority of the seats allotted to Blacks in the April 1979 election, \nand the country adopted the name Zimbabwe. Without PF participation or support \nthe new government was unable to end the warfare. Britain briefly retook control of \nSouthern Rhodesia as a colony until a new round of elections was held in February 1980. Of the 80 contested Black seats, ZANU won 57, ZAPU 20, and the UANC 3.

What are the major problems facing the agricultural sector in Africa?The End of Apartheid in South AfricaAfter the end of the Second World War, the South African white rulers in general and \nthe Afrikaner National Party in particular, began to develop a strong fear towards the South African black population thinking that unless strong measures were taken to control them the blacks may eventually dominate the urban areas and the economy of South Africa. The white leaders of South Africa also thought that the anti-colonial struggle which was getting intensified in other parts of Africa could be imported to South Africa as well. The Afrikaner National Party, which launched a strong an -\nti-black racist propaganda easily, won the 1948 general election in South Africa."

The government came up with extremely racist rules and regulations to guarantee the superiority of the white race in South Africa at the expense of the majority black population of the country.  The blatant racist policy of South Africa that attempted to make the minority white rule perpetual was known as ‘apartheid ‘which means ‘separateness’. Theapartheid system considered the major-ity indigenous black population of South Africa as alien and foreigners in their own land. The South African black populations were forced to live in separate quarters which were overcrowded and relatively backward areas.  \nIn 1950, the white government in South Africa introduced a new racist policy known \nas ‘Population Registration Act’. This newly introduced law classified and registered the people of South Africa based on race into whites and non-whites. The non-whites group included the majority blacks, Asians, and peoples with mixed races. The native black populations of South Africa too were further divided into several ethnic groups including the peoples of Zulu, Xhosa, Tswana, Venda and Sotho. \nIn the same year, an additional law was issued in South Africa known as ‘The Group \nAreas Act’. This Act clearly indicated the residential areas where the white and non-white settlers were allowed to reside, and work based on race. The two acts that were issued in South Africa in the year 1950 laid the foundation for the racist apart -\nheid system which had strong impact on the lives of the people of South Africa. These acts made the native black Africans inferior and prevented sexual relations between different races. Separate public places, buses and schools were arranged for the whites and non-white peoples in South Africa.

Although the blacks were allowed to work in factories with meager pays and under bad working conditions, their rights as employees were not recognized.

The South African white racist government had realized the seriousness of the blacks struggle and began to take strong measures to stop the mass protests. The first action taken by the apartheid regime of South Africa was banning the two political organizations in South Africa namely: the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC).  The brutal acts of the South African government were sharply condemned not only by the black population of South Africa, but also by the international community. \nThe newly emerging independent states in Africa and Asia expressed their solidarity \nwith the people of South Africa. The United Nations Organization (UNO) too con-demned the brutal acts of the South African government. Many countries also called for imposition of economic sanctions against South Africa. In fact, the planned eco-nomic sanctions were not materialized as pro-South African influential states in the UN Security Council, particularly Great Britain and the USA used their veto power to cancel the proposed economic sanction against South Africa. Although the ANC was banned by the South African white regime, it had continued its struggle and the then presidentof ANC, Albert Luthuis, had managed to win the Nobel Peace Prize award of the year 1961.The South African racist regime was isolated from the international community and received world-wide condemnation.

These mass risings forced the South African government to lift the ban it has imposed against some black trade unions. Concurrently, the South African blacks introduced a new movement which they called ‘Black Consciousness’ with the view to restore black dignity. The ‘Black Consciousness’ movement increased the determination of the blacks in South Africa to get independence by themselves without seeking the assis-tance of white men including white liberals. The struggle continued and in the early 1980s, the South African blacks refused to use white-owned shops and businesses, schools and renting houses particularly in Eastern Cape and Transvaal."

Pan-Africanism assumes a common brotherhood or sisterhood of all black peoples of Africa, North and South America, and the West Indies. It originated and devel -\noped outside the African continent by black people of African origin in the Ameri -\ncas. Afro-American people in the USA and the Caribbean were the first to introduce Pan-African ideas. These people of African origin in the “New World” were living in alien lands, and thus they felt they had been made homeless by their eviction from their countries of origin and forced to live in a social environment unknown and un-friendly to them. Therefore, they wanted to have equality with the other races and justice for black people. At least in the beginning, Pan-Africanism was the resistance of black people against white racism. For many of them, Africa was a continent where black people lived in happiness and freedom. Apparently, this view of Africa without frontiers or divisions seems to have given birth to the idea of the United States of Africa. The term “pan” means “all” in Greek. Therefore, we can conclude that Pan-Af-ricanism means bringing Africans together. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to: CompetenciesLESSON 5\n7.5.

The first Pan-African Con-ference was organized by a man from Trinidad and Tobago known as H. Sylvester Williams. The participants of the First Pan-African Conference were manly people who came from America and the West Indies. Before 1945, four Pan-African Confer-ences were held. The two prominent Pan–African leaders during that period were Dr. William Du Bois (1868-1963) and Marcus Garvey (1887-1940). Du Bois was an Afri -\ncan-American scholar and writer. He became an organizer and preacher of Pan-Afri -\ncanism. Du Bois is referred to as the Father of Pan-Africanism. Although both Du Bois and Garvey were prominent leaders of the Pan-Africanism Movement, they had no harmonious relationship. They were criticizing and blaming each other.\nMarcus Garvey was a Jamaican who moved to and lived in the USA. Garvey was a \nfounder and leader of the Universal Negro Association. Du Bois and Marcus Garvey had some differences about the future of people of African origin living outside the Africa continent. Du Bois believed that black people residing outside their mother continent should struggle to ensure their rights in their host countries. Contrary to this stand,  Marcus Garvey insisted that the only bright future for people of African origin living outside Africa was to return to their mother continent, Africa. To materi -\nalize this dream, Garvey organized the so called “Back to Africa Movement.” The Uni-versal Negro Improvement Association, established by Garvey in 1914, was meant to promote his “Back to Africa Movement.”\nThe year 1945 was a landmark in the history of the Pan-Africanism Movement. In \n1945, the Fifth Pan-African Conference was held in Manchester. This conference was different from the previous Pan-African conferences in the sense that it was the first time that Africans from the African continent participated and the issue of in-dependence of Africa was raised. Some of the participants of the Fifth Pan-African Conference were the future leaders of independent Africa, like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya. The participants of the Manchester Conference expressed their determination to resort to violent means unless their demand for independence is seriously considered by the colonial powers. The decisions of the Fifth Pan-African Conference brought Africans together in the struggle to achieve political independence."

One of the issues in the Pan-Africanism Movement was materializing the unity of Africans particularly African states. The slogan for this leading idea was to establish the United States of Africa. After the Manchester Con -\nference, however there was a division among the then African leaders and politicians over the issue of creating a single politically united Africa. Some nationalist African leaders considered the creation of nation states as the first step towards creating a larger United States of Africa. Among the advocates of this idea, we can mention President Julious Nyerere of Tanzania and President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana.\nAfter independence, however, new trends contrary to this idea began to appear. In \nmany African countries, nationalist movements and their leaders have begun to give priority to their national cause and achieving independence of their respective coun -\ntries. These African nationalists insisted that pan-Africanism should be materialized better after the African countries first achieve independence and underlined that Pan-Africanism should not be allowed to weaken the position and sovereignty of the emerging individual African nation states. This division in Pan–Africanism became a source of problem, which continued to trouble the unity of African nations in the post-independence period. The OAU was founded in May 1963 in Addis Ababa, by 32 African states with the main aim of bringing the African nations together and resolv -\ning the issues within the continent. Its first ever conference was held on May 1, 1963 in Addis Ababa.\nThe OAU had the following primary aims:\nTo coordinate and intensify the co-operation of African states in order to\nachieve a better life for the peoples of Africa;\n.\nTo defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of African\nstates.\nTo eradicate of all forms of colonialism and white minority rule.\nThe period was a time when many new African states were established.

First, it would defend the interests of independent African states and help the independence struggle waged by African peoples. Secondly, it would remain neutral in terms of world affairs, preventing its members from being controlled once more by outside powers.\nA Liberation Committee was established to aid independence movements and look \nafter the interests of already-independent states. The OAU also aimed to stay neutral in terms of global politics, taking the Cold War into consideration. The other aims of the OAU included ensuring that all Africans enjoy human rights; raising the living \nstandards of all Africans and settling\n arguments and disputes between members – not through fighting but rather through \npeaceful and diplomatic negotiation. \nMost of the newly emerging independent African states were in favor of the creation \nof continental organization. Some of the African states wanted to establish a conti-nental African organization that could lead to the creation of a federation of African states or the United States of Africa. The other group of African states too wanted the creation of a continental African organization that could lead to economic integra-tion and in the long run political integration.\nOne of the groups was the Casablanca group. This group was founded in the year \n1961 and its member states were Ghana, Algeria, Guinea, Morocco, Egypt, Mali and Libya.

Since 1963, Addis Ababa is serving as the headquarters of OAU and then the African Union (AU). Thirty-two independent African states established the OAU by signing its charter.  \nThe OAU has helped African countries under colonial rule to achieve independence. \nAlmost all the African states had joined the OAU. In fact, one member i.e., Morocco has left the OAU in November 1984 in protest against the OAU’s decision to admit the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic as Western Saharan state two years earlier i.e., 1982.\nThe OAU was criticized for being a bureaucratic forum of the African oppressive rul-\ners rather than an organization that is much concerned about the peoples of Africa. Some call the OAU “Dictators’ Club” or “Dictator’s Trade Union”. The OAU had neither a strong agency to enforce its decisions nor a military wing or armed force of its own. Attempts were made by the OAU to mediate disputes between member states, but they were not always successful. The OAU could not stop civil wars in Africa that lasted for long and caused serious human and material destruction. In this regard, we can mention the civil wars in Nigeria and Angola. \nOne of the controversial policies of the OAU was its policy of non-interference in the \naffairs of member states. Based on this policy, the OAU kept silent when governments of member African states clearly violated the human rights of their citizens. The OAU failed even to condemn the ruthless acts of African dictator rulers like Idi Amin Dada of Uganda against their fellow people. \nThe Role of Ethiopia in Uniting Africans: Successes and Failures of the \nOAU\nEthiopia is the only African country that was never colonized as it had successfully \ndefeated the Italian colonizing force in 1896 at the battle of Adwa. Ethiopia was the sole African polity whose independence to be recognized by the colonial powers in the era of colonization. Ethiopia, with its ancient civilization and remarkable victory against Italy, was a role model not only for Africans but also the entire black race who were fighting for their independence. As mentioned already, the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, had played a significant role in bridging the gap between the Casa-blanca and Monrovia blocs and the establishment of the OAU in Addis Ababa in 1963."

Emperor Haile Selassie has supported the South Africans’ struggle against apartheid. Ethiopia has given military training to the ANC leader Nelson Mandela in Addis Ababa. Colonel Mengestu Haile Mariam too, has supported the Zimbabweans in their struggle for independence. Ethiopia has trained thousands of Zimbabwean freedom fighters.  \nThe OAU as any organization has success and failure stories. Although it had some \nshortcomings, the OAU was successful in some respects. Many of its members were members of the UN, too, and they stood together within the United Nations Organi -\nzation (UNO) to safeguard African interests’ particularly in the anti-colonial struggle. Its pursuit of African unity, therefore, was in some ways successful.\nBringing political integration in Africa was a very difficult task and most of the Af-\nrican countries were divided. The ties between the independent African states and their colonial masters were very strong even after independence. For instance, most of the African countries that were colonized by France were very much dependent on their colonial master, France. As we have seen already, many of these former French colonies had formed their own block before the establishment of OAU, known as the Monrovia Group. Ideology was the other dividing factor. After the cold war, some African states became pro-West while others were in favor of the Eastern block and became Socialist oriented. Among the leaders of the first African states to achieve independence, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana was in favor of the Eastern bloc that was led by the Soviet Union while the president of Ivory Coast, Félix Houphouet-Boi-gny, was in favor of the West i.e. the capitalist block. Because of their ideological \ndifferences, the African states were facing difficulties to reach consensus on some important issues and take measures against states involved in internal conflicts.\nIt is undeniable that the OAU had a significant contribution in the struggle of the Af-\nricans to bring an end to the era of colonialism and in combating the minority white racist rule in South Africa.

Eventually, all the African countries managed to achieve their political independence. But the political independence of the African states was not supported by economic emancipation. As most of the Afri -\ncan countries were not economically self-sufficient, their political independence was incomplete and remained economically dependent on their former colonial masters. The politically independent African states continued to receive financial aid and loans from their former colonial countries. These financial loans were often given with preconditions in addition to re-payment with high interest rates. If the loans were taken to establish industries in Africa, the manufactured goods were expected to be sold for the loaner countries at very low prices. \nThe two super-powers of the post-World War II era i.e., the USA and the USSR were \ncompeting in Africa to advance their ideologies and benefit economically by exploit -\ning the resources of Africa. These contending super-powers sometimes helped the African states in the form of technology and sending aid workers. \nTransformation from AAU to AU\nOn 9 September1999, the Heads of States and Governments of Africa met in Libya at an OAU Summit and issued the Sirte Declaration which called for the establishment of a new continental Organization known as the African Union that replaces the Or-ganization of African Unity (OAU).The main reason behind the issuance of the Sirte Declaration was a desire to hasten the process of integration of the African states and help Africa contribute its part in the global economy besides confronting with the adverse effects of globalization in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres.\nEstablishment of the African Union\nThe new African continental union, the African Union (AU) that officially replaced the Organization of African Union (OAU) was officially inaugurated in July 2002 in the South African city of Durban.

To realize these intended goals, the AU has set up agencies like: The Pan-African Parliament, the Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC).

For instance, in northern Nigeria, railroads were built mainly for this purpose. In Sierra Leone too, the discovery of minerals deposited led to either the expansion or the building of spur lines to facilitate the exploitation of these minerals.\nOne of the major impacts of colonialism on the African continent was the fact that it \nled to the under-development of the colonized African countries in different ways. Although the colonial powers had introduced modern education in their colonies in African colonies, the education could not bring in Africa as it was designed by the Europeans to materialize their selfish imperialist needs and had nothing to do with the African realities.  Colonialism had an economic impact on Africa as well. The colonial powers distorted the patterns of economic development in Africa in many ways. The colonial powers brought disarticulation in the production of goods, mar -\nkets, trade, transport, provision of social services, and the pattern of urbanization and the like.  Colonialism also disarticulated the African markets and trades. The indigenous market centers in Africa were disoriented by colonialism. The colonial powers established new marketing centers and trade routes to facilitate the smooth export of raw materials to their industries in Europe and to import manufactured goods from Europe to their African colonies. This European economic activity culmi-nated in the weakening and eventual death of most of the native African marketing centers. This resulted in the distortion of the African indigenous pattern of African economic development and urbanization. Colonialism made the African trade main-ly export-import oriented. This integrated Africa’s trade and economy premature -\nly into the world market and international trade. This premature integration had a detrimental effect on Africa and benefited the economically and technologically advanced European countries and made the African countries economically depen -\ndent on the colonial powers. The raw materials produced by the Africans in Africa were not used by industries located in Africa. They were instead exported to Europe. Therefore, there was no organic linkage between the agricultural and the industrial sectors in Africa. Subsequently, the African economy could not move forward be-cause the surplus profits appropriated by the colonial powers were not ploughed back or spent within the African economy. The European colonial powers also disar -\nticulated the development of a comprehensive transport system in Africa."

The transport networks developed by the European colonizers in Africa were mainly lim -\nited to rail roads and shipping lines. In general, there was a lack of economic inte-gration and cooperation among the African territories during the colonial period. Colonialism also led to the disarticulation of the provision of social facilities and the pattern of urbanization in Africa.\nThe social facilities during the colonial period were not only very limited in num -\nber but were also concentrated in a few places, particularly urban areas. This forced \nmany people from the rural areas to migrate to the urban centers where the social amenities were better.The resulting problems of disarticulation of provision of ame-nities and urbanization include among other things rural- urban migration, over -\ncrowding, filthy and slump environment, poor hygienic condition, spread of epidem -\nic disease, social evils, and ethnic problems. \nColonialism in Africa also led to the emergence of classes and class struggle in the \nsocio-economic and political life of the continent.

The driving force behind the liberation struggle was African nationalism, which grew in a gradual process af -\nter the end of the First World War. Among the factors that contributed to the growth of African nationalism, the most important one was the Pan-African movement. The movement raised the consciousness of Africans through resolutions it passed at various conferences held from 1919 on. Among the conferences, however, the fifth, held in Manchester in 1945, was very important. For the first time in the history of Pan-Africanism, the resolution of this conference raised a demand for the indepen -\ndence of Africa. This resolution provided a slogan which rallied Africans in the strug-gle for independence.\nThe nature of the struggle for independence was not similar throughout the Afri-\ncan continent. In some parts of the continent, independence was achieved smoothly, while in others it entailed a bloody conflict. The main factors that decided the na-ture of the liberation movements were the presence or absence of white settlers in the colonies and whether the concerned colonialist states were prepared to decolo -\nnize. In the colonies without white settlers, independence was achieved more or less smoothly. In the colonies with white settlers, however, independence was achieved only after a protracted armed struggle. Since Portugal decided to cling to its colonies until the last moment, the colonies of Portugal had to fight national liberation wars to achieve independence.\nAmong the factors that hastened the process of independence, one was the forma-\ntion of the Organization for African Unity (OAU). The process of forming the OAU, which started in 1958, was not smooth. There were differences of opinion among Af-rican states over the structure of the organization.

Then, the EPRDF facilitated the establishment of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) soon after the overthrow of the Derg. The TGE was formed after a National Conference was convened in Addis Ababa in June 1991. The conference produced the “Transi-tional Government Charter of Ethiopia.” The Transitional Government of Ethiopia was set up based on the” Transitional Period Charter that was in effect from 1991 until the endorsement of the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethi-opia in 1995.\nDuring the Transitional Period a new ethnic and language based administrative \nstructure was introduced and fourteen regions were set up replacing the previous fourteen geographic based provinces.

The 1931 constitution was revised in 1955. The 1955 Revised Constitution was sus-pended by the Derg regime when it assumed political power in 1974. For nearly a decade and a half the military rule had no constitution and ruled by decrees and proclamations. The Derg issued its constitution in 1987. But the 1987 was short-lived as the Derg regime was overthrown in 1991. \nThe Transitional Government of Ethiopia took the issue of writing a new constitu -\ntion as one of its priorities and set up a constituent assembly. The members of the \nconstituent assembly prepared a draft constitution and presented it for at least a nominal “public discussion” as did the previous Derg regime. Although some groups claim that they were not represented in the drafting and endorsement process, the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia was finally endorsed in August 1955. This brought an end to the Transitional Government of Ethiopia that was established immediately after the demise of the military regime.  \nThe new constitution was better than its predecessors in the sense that it has at least \nin principle recognized human and democratic rights. The constitution also recog-nized international regional declarations regarding human and democratic rights. The 1995 constitution is also unique because it recognized the rights of nations, na-tionalities and peoples for self-determination including independence. In fact, the EPRDF led government was not the first to raise the question of nations and nation-alities to self-determination. This question was first echoed in 1969 by the Ethiopian students’ movement. Article 39, which is one of the most controversial articles of the FDRE Constitution, clearly states that “Every Ethiopian Nation, Nationality and peo-ple has an unconditional right to self-determination.’’ The same article on another sub-provision stated that “Every Nation, Nationality and People has the right to a full measure of self-government. Some Ethiopian scholars and politicians argue that this article encourages secession and is potentially very dangerous for the very survival of the country."

Ato Meles Zenawi, who was the chairperson of the EPRDF, became the first Prime Minister of FDRE and the commander–in-chief of the Ethiopian Armed Forces. Dr. Negaso Gidada, a member of the Oromo Peoples’ Democratic Movement (OPDO), was the first elected president of the government of FDRE. The FDRE set up a federal structure with a parliamentarian system of government.\nThe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia is a federal state with a parliamentari -\nan system of government. The FDRE government originally had nine regions and two \ncity states, namely Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa. In fact, recently, two more regions have emerged: the Sidama Regional State and the Sothwestern Ethiopian regional state. The federal structure is formed mainly based on language and ethnicity.

Therefore, the rights of Ethiopian citizens to form associations, to express their beliefs and participation in elections are given constitutional recognition. In fact, there are questions on the imple -\nmentation of these constitutionally recognized rights. \nElections in Ethiopia under the EPRDF Government\nElections were not totally new phenomenon in Ethiopia. The Revised Constitution of Ethiopia of 1955 was the first to introduce formal political elections in Ethiopia. There were also elections during the military regime although they were apparently not genuine ones. The EPRDF led government of Ethiopia too had conducted peri -\nodic election after five years interval. Accordingly, general elections were conduct-ed in Ethiopia since the endorsement of the 1995 constitution. Accordingly, general elections were also conducted in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015.  The first general elec-tion for seats in the House of People’s Representatives and regional assemblies was conducted in May 1995. Some political parties like the All Amhara Peoples’ Organi -\nzation, Council of Alternative Forces for Peace and Democracy in Ethiopia and Ethi -\nopian Democratic Unity Party boycotted the 1995 election. In this first election, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Party (EPRDF) got a majority seat in parliament and formed a government.\nAfter five years in the year 2000 a second round of general election was held. The \n2000 election was better than the 1995 election in the sense that many political par-ties including those who were not willing to participate in the previous election like the All-Amhara People’s Organization, had taken part. Nevertheless, the result of the 2000 election was not different from the 1995. Again the EPRDF claimed a landslide victory and managed to form a government.\nThe third round of election that was conducted in the year 2005 was unique com-\npared to the previous two elections. In this round of the Ethiopian general election, there was much hope and optimism on the part of the people and the contending political parties. The opposition parties were better organized and united than ever before. Parties that had boycotted the previous election now decided to take part in the 2005 general election. They even formed a very strong coalition to come out victories in the general election and assume political power defeating the EPRDF"

The EPRDF also \nseemed to welcome the prospect of free and fair elections as it agreed to restruc-\nture the Electoral Board (NEBE), promised tocease restrictions on opposition ac -\ntivities, and allowed free access to observers. Parliamentary elections took place on May 15, 2005, with a reported 90% turnout. The opposition parties managed to win 180 seats in the House of Peoples’ Representatives. In Addis Ababa for instance, the Coalition for Unity and Democracy had won all the 23 seats for the federal parlia -\nment. Although the opposition parties were complaining the NEBE declared that the EPRDF has won more than 50% +1 vote and again formed a government. The oppo-sition parties were not willing to accept the NEBE’s announcement of victory of the EPRDF and protests followed in the country particularly in the capital, Addis Ababa which led to the death of hundreds of protestors and the arrest of many protestors \nincluding leaders of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy Part y. Many opposition \nparty leaders and members were brought to trial and were sentenced to life impris -\nonment although they were eventually given amnesty.\nAgain after five years i.e., in the year 2010 another round of general election was \nconducted. But by then the optimism that was observed in 2005 was non-existent. \nAs usual after the end the election the NEBE announced that the EPRDF has got the majority of seats in parliament. In the year 2015 too there was another Parliamen -\ntary election in which again the EPRDF claimed it won most of the seats and formed government.\nPeace and Democracy and Equality of Nations and Nationalities\nThere was relative peace in Ethiopia under the EPRDF before the outbreak of the \nEthio-Eritrean Wa r. Therefore, the peasants could till their land without serious \nproblems. The Ethiopians, who were engaged in various professions, were able to do their jobs with relative ease. Under the EPRDF government, the previous forced conscription of young people for national military service was abandoned.\nThe question of democracy was also repeatedly raised in Ethiopia, more than \never before under the EPRDF government. It seems that the ordinary people of \nEthiopia focused only on the right part of democracy rather than the obligations that are associated with democracy.  In fact,"

They argue that freedom of speech and association were only on paper and not practically implemented. People were imprisoned for what they said, thought, and did. Although the rights of the majority were recognized, the rights of the minority people, particu -\nlarly those who were living outside their region, were not duly respected. Unlike the majority, who were thought to be owners of the regions, the minority settlers were, in most cases, denied the right to learn, get a trial, and work using their vernacular languages. In fact, democracy in Ethiopia is still at its infancy. \nThe FDRE government has made a serious attempt to guarantee the equality of na-\ntions, nationalities, and peoples. No nation, nationality, or people were recognized to be neither inferior nor superior to others. This is manifested by the recognition of all nations and nationalities for self-determination, the right to get an education and a trial in one’s own vernacular or mother tongue language.\nPolitical Parties and National Elections\nEthiopia under the Derg regime employed a system of one-party politics, and no par -\nty, except for the ruling WPE Party, was allowed to take part in elections. In contrast, The EPRDF-led government introduced a multi-party system, and a number of politi -\ncal parties began mushrooming. Although a multi–party system was promised by the EPRDF–led government that led Ethiopia for more than two decades and a half, there was no multi-party system rather than a single dominant party system of the EPRDF.\nThe Ethio-Eritrean War\nThe Ethio-Eritrean War that broke out in 1998 was apparently a boundary dispute that took place between Ethiopia and Eritrea. On 6 May 1998, the Eritrean forces launched a military assault on the disputed territory of Badme. Consequently, on the 13th of May 1998 the Ethiopian forces launched a counteroffensive against the Eritrean forces.\nThe USA and Rwanda sought to mediate between the two warring states and pre -\npared a peace plan proposal calling for the immediate evacuation of the invading \nEritrean troops from the disputed regions.

On 22 February 1999, Ethiopia launched a massive military offensive against the forces of Eritrea to restore Badme. The Ethiopian counter-offensive was known as “Operation Sunset”. The Ethiopian military assault was successful, and the Ethiopian troops managed to control most of the contested territories, including Badme and Zalambessa, and on 25 May Ethiopia declared that the war was over. The causalities of the Ethio-Eritrean war were heavy. Tens of thousands of combatants were killed on both sides, and many more were wounded.\nOn 18 June 2000, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and President Isaias Afewerki agreed \nto a comprehensive peace agreement and binding arbitration of their disputes un -\nder the Algiers Agreement. In July 2000, the United Nations Security Council adopt-ed Resolution 1312 and a 25-kilometer-wide Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) was established within Eritrea, patrolled by the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) and over 60 countries. On December 12, 2000, a peace agreement was signed by the two governments.\nOn April 13, 2002, the Ethio-Eritrean Boundary Commission that was established \nunder the Algiers Agreement in collaboration with the Permanent Court of Arbi -\ntration in The Hague, issued “final and binding” verdict. The ruling awarded some territory to each side, but Badme was awarded to Eritrea. But the signing of the Al -\ngiers Peace Agreement and the decision of the Ethio-Eritrean Boundary Commission could not bring peace. Although both countries had pledged to accept the decision of the boundary commission, the two countries, particularly Ethiopia, requested fur -\nther explanation, and the decision of the commission was not implemented. Since then, Ethiopia and Eritrea remained in a state of no peace no war situation for over a decade.

The Derg did not al -\nlow peasants to sell their land. Land was, by then, a public and government property. In fact, some scholars claim that by giving the peasants land, the military regime made the peasantry totally dependent on it. Likewise, under the EPRDF government, land was still state property.\nAgriculture has exhibited significant progress and improvement under the EPRDF \ngovernment. Even the country’s economic policy was declared to be agricultural led. Fertilizers and improved seeds have enabled farmers to greatly increase their agri-cultural yield. Farming without fertilizers and improved seeds has become a thing of the past. Agricultural Extension Workers are trained in large numbers and are engaged in following up on the activities of the peasant farmers. The government was encouraging the model peasants by giving awards of moral and material encour-agement.\nInfrastructural Developments\nAfter its assumption of political power in 1991, the EPRDF gave priority to the de-velopment of infrastructure. Since the mid-1990s, road infrastructure and education have been the top two sectors attracting the highest share of the government budget. The first official document released by EPRDF in 1995 on its vision of economic de-velopment recognized the significance and urgency of rehabilitating and expanding infrastructure. The strategy was known as “ Agricultural Development-Led Industri-alization” (ADLI), and it recognized that infrastructure development in the areas of electric power, roads, railways, telecommunications, and water supply was critical totriggering economic growth through the active participation of the private sector.\nExpansion and rehabilitation of rural roads were given top priority by the EPRDF government. Another major infrastructure project that attracted the government’s attention was a rural electrification program called the Universal Electrification Access Program (UEAP). Similarly, the Ethiopian government plans to expand its \ntelecommunications infrastructure. The expansion of the telecommunications infra -\nstructure generated employment primarily in urban centers."

Nevertheless, in both treaties, Ethiopia, which contributes more than 85% of the Blue Nile, was not invited to take part. In fact, in the 1929 treaty, not even Sudan was consulted. In the absence of the Sudan, Britain and Egypt concluded the treaty. Ethiopia was not only invited to take part in the signing of the 1929 agreement but was also given no share of the water of the Blue Nile. In 1959, another treaty on the utilization of the waters of the Blue Nile between Great Britain, Egypt, and Sudan was signed. Again, in this treaty, Ethiopia was not only excluded but also got no share of the waters of the Blue Nile. The 1959 agreement apportioned Egypt 55.5 billion cubic meters per annum, while the Sudan’s share was decided to be 18.5 billion cubic meters. The 1959 Agreement created a watershed in the hydro-political history of the Nile valley in the sense that it ensured a monopoly on the waters of the Nile by Egypt and Sudan. In fact, Ethiopia did not give recognition to this colonial treaty, of which she was not a signatory. At-tempts made to use the Nile waters by Ethiopia beginning with the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie I were not successful as donors and international monetary organiza-tions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank were unwill -\ning to give loans for projects on the Nile waters. Finally, in the year 2011, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Ato Meles Zenawi, laid the foundation stone for the construc-tion of the Ethiopia Renaissance Dam, which is today known as the Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, and which has a capacity of generating 6000 Mega Watts of elec-tric power. The Ethiopian government decided to build the dam with the financial contribution of the Ethiopian people. Nearly all the Ethiopians, including the rich and the poor, took the project as a national project and made financial contributions, particularly by purchasing bonds. Egypt and Sudan were and are still working hard to obstruct the building of the Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam with the support of the great power of the USA.

Ethiopia had a meaningful contribution to the struggle not to make Somalia a safe haven for terror -\nist groups. As Ethiopia itself was vulnerable to terrorist attacks, the EPRDF led Ethi -\nopian government has worked in collaboration with the international community, particularly the government of the U.S.A. Ethiopia has also taken its own measures against terrorism, ranging from dealing with internal “terrorists” to attacking ter-rorists by launching punitive military campaigns within the territories of Somalia.

It refers \nto the understandings, skills, and philosophies developed by societies with long his-tories of interaction with their natural surroundings. \nIt is also integral to a cultural complex that encompasses all aspects of life, such as: \nhistory, cultural practices, language, the environment and ecological relationships, resource use practices, social interactions, healing, ritual and spirituality. In short, it comprises knowledge systems and practices developed within a particular culture \nor society independent of, and prior to, the advent of the modern scientific kno wl-\nedge system. Hence, it is also known as local knowledge, folk knowledge, people’s \nknowledge, traditional wisdom, or traditional science. That is why it is considered an important catalyst for sustainable overall development.\nIndigenous knowledge passes from generation to generation, usually by word of"

On the other hand, most of the indigenous knowledge disappears due to the intrusion of foreign technologies and development concepts that promise short-term gains or solutions to problems without being capable of sustaining them.\nUnique Characteristic Features \nWhat are the unique characteristic features of indigenous knowledge?Indigenous knowledge has the following unique characteristic features:\n1.Indigenous knowledge is local. It is rooted in a particular place and is generat -\ned by people living in those places. Indigenous knowledge is unique to a given\nculture or society. It is the lived experience of each community that informs\nindigenous knowledge.\n2.Indigenous knowledge is based on historical experiences but adapts to social,economic, environmental, spiritual, and political changes. It is not rooted in aspecific period of history, but has evolved, adapted, and grown over millennia;it is dynamic.\n3.Indigenous knowledge is cumulative. It is a body of knowledge and skills de -\nveloped from centuries of living in close proximity to nature. It is the conse -\nquence of practical engagement reinforced by experience and trial and error.\n4.Indigenous knowledge is holistic. All aspects of life are interconnected andare not considered in isolation but as a part of the whole. It incorporates allaspects of life: spirituality, history, cultural practices, social interactions, lan -\nguage, healing, etc.\n5.Indigenous knowledge is humble. Indigenous knowledge does not dictatehow to control nature but how to live in harmony with the gifts of the Creator.\n6.Indigenous knowledge is intergenerational. Collective memory is passedwithin a community from one generation to the next orally through language,\nstories, songs, ceremonies, legends, and proverbs.\n7.Indigenous knowledge is invaluable. It has been argued that Indigenousknowledge is the key to sustainable social and economic development.\n8.Indigenous knowledge is irreplaceable. There is nothing western science can"

There is a morality in indigenous knowl-\nedge—a right and wrong way to interact with nature.\n10.Indigenous knowledge is relative. Indigenous knowledge is not embodied tothe same degree by all community members. The elderly will obviously carrymore knowledge than younger community members.\n11.Indigenous knowledge is responsible. Indigenous peoples generally believethey are responsible for the well-being of the natural environment aroundthem.\n12.Indigenous knowledge is spiritual. It is rooted in a social context that sees theworld in terms of social and spiritual relations among all life forms.\n13.Indigenous knowledge is valid. It does not require the validation of westernscience.\nHowever, the colonial and western education systems have negatively affected the indigenous knowledge systems of African, Asian, and Latin American countries. Even in the post-independence period, modern education seems to consider indigenous knowledge systems as primitive, simple, and static. As a result, there is a grave risk that much indigenous knowledge is being lost and, along with it, valuable knowledge about ways of living sustainably both ecologically and socially. Recently, however, the potential of indigenous knowledge in the sustainable development process has been getting the attention of academics, scientists, development planners, and policy makers in developing countries.\nEthiopia’s Indigenous Knowledge System \nEthiopia is an ancient country and the home of people who have diverse cultures. \nHence, it is very rich in different indigenous knowledge systems in such areas as agriculture, architecture, medicine, cottage industry, philosophy, conflict resolution, etc. In Ethiopia, indigenous knowledge systems are most often specific to a particu-lar physical, economic, and cultural environment. Conditions for adoption or devel-opment of indigenous knowledge are the production-associated problems such as land degradation, erosion, climate or weather change, topography/landscape feature change, and change in the economic, social, and cultural settings of the community. Some of these indigenous techniques are flexible and area specific as they rely main-"

Until the 20th century, in many parts of Ethiopia, local traditions of smelting iron ores, tanning hides and skins and weaving clothes had existed for centuries and had been crucial to rural livelihoods. The Oromo people are renowned for their indigenous democratic socio-political system, known as the Gada system. The Afar people have an indigenous, unique information exchange system called Dagu. The Konso people \nare famous for their traditional skills in hillside terracing and banding. The Dorze people are highly renowned for their weaving skills. The Surma people are known \nfor their traditional family planning methods. \nThe Gumuz have incredible indigenous knowledge of shifting cultivators and natural \nresource management. In rural parts of Ethiopia, if someone is struck by lightning, the survivor will be immediately brought into contact with moist ground or dung. This practice is substantiated by static electricity theory, though most rural people are unable to explain it.\nMoreover, Ethiopia is very rich in oral and written philosophical literature. The Ethi-\nopians’ spiritual and secular philosophies are mainly written in Ge’ez, Arabic, and other languages. Moreover, Ethiopians are very rich in oral expressions of wisdom, including mainly proverbs, songs, and folktales. Ethiopians also have well-developed traditional methods of conflict resolution. Ethiopians, in their long history, also dis -\ncovered the medicinal properties of many plants. However, the indigenous knowl -\nedge systems of the various peoples of Ethiopia have not been well identified, stud-ied, documented, and utilized to improve the quality of their lives.

In its broader sense, heritage includes everything that people want to save. Hence, heritage refers to both the material and non-material culture of man as well as elements of nature that man lives with.\nHeritages are essential components of almost every human experience. In this view, \nheritage is viewed as a personal inheritance from the past, a past that can be used in the present. It is the subject of the past that an individual inherits from his or her family, ancestors, tradition, or nation. According to this view, heritage comes to mean oral history (tradition), written history, buildings, landscapes, objects, pic -\ntures, memoirs, sounds, cultural beliefs, etc.\nActivity 9.1\n1.

Nevertheless, the number of Ethiopian heritage sites that are registered by UNESCO is apparently too small compared to the numerous cultural and religious heritage materials and sites. Even today, there are numerous heritages that meet UN-ESCO’s criteria for designation as world heritage. Therefore, the task of registering Ethiopia’s cultural, historical, and religious heritage by UNESCO should be a priority agenda for all concerned bodies.\nValues of Heritages\nHeritage has a significant value to promote interpretation of the past by making rela -\ntions with and providing insight into past people and events through shared experi-ences.  The historical value of heritage sites mainly depends on direct experience of \nelements that survived from the past. Commemorative values of heritage deal with the meaning of a heritage for those who identify with it or have connections to it. Many heritage sites maintain humans’ collective memory and identity. In this regard, war memorials (battlefields), public statues, and palaces are examples of memorials whose meanings are usually unforgettable.\nHeritage also serves as a symbol of nationalism. It serves a great purpose in defining \nnational identity. Identity, however, goes beyond the national level. Hence, heritage strengthens identities at the level of our home, neighborhood, towns, and region as well as at the continental and international level. The common purpose of heritage is to make some people feel better, more rooted and more secure. There are many her -\nitage sites that are professed as sources of identity, interaction, and coherence and hence have greater socio-political value. Heritages are an integral part of the concept of nation building. They are also instruments for creating a sense of belongingness to a common place.\nTypes of Heritages\nAccording to the World Heritage Convention of 1972, heritage is broadly classified into two major categories: cultural and natural.\nCultural Heritage \nCultural heritage is any tangible or intangible object that is the product of the cre-ativity and labor of man in pre-literary history and historical times. It describes and"

Cultural heritage is classified into tangible and \nintangible cultural heritage. Tangible cultural heritage is that which can be seen and felt. They are further divided into movable and immovable historical and human-cre -\nated cultural heritage. As the name suggests, movable cultural heritage is the one type of cultural heritage that is not attached to the foundation and that can be moved from place to place easily, and which has been handed down from generation to gen-eration.\nWould you give some examples of movable cultural heritage from your own locality? \nThe following could be relevant examples of movable cultural heritage. Parchment manuscripts, stone paintings and implements, sculptures made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, stone, inscriptions of skin, ivory, horn, and archaeological remains.\nHeritage includes natural reserves, museums, fauna, flora, geology, habitats, and wa-\nter. Landscape, for its part, refers to national parks, gardens, coasts, cultural and ar -\nchaeological landscapes, mountain chains, and natural areas.  These heritage places \nmay be significant for scientific, aesthetic, architectural, historical, or any other spe-cial cultural value.\nThe other components of heritage, which encompass buildings, monuments, archae -\nological remains, and sculpture, are the other components of heritage. In addition, \nnational battle fields, historic markers, and mythical sites are part of our heritage. Ar-tifacts such as museum artifacts, family albums, art works and activities like clubs and societies, legislation, language, religion, performing arts, sports, diet and drink, calendars, customs, crafts are all parts of heritage.  Heritage also comprises other el -\nements such as atrocity sites, plagues, saint’s relics, heroes, victims, and graveyards.\nAs opposed to tangible cultural heritage, intangible cultural heritage is that which \ncannot be touched and felt by the hands but can be seen or heard.  Intangible cultural heritages constitute different kinds of performances and shows, religious, wedding and mourning ceremonies, music, drama, literature and similar other cultural val-ues, traditions and customs of nation, nationalities and peoples.\nLiterature (Geez)\nAlthough it is often said that Ge’ez literature is dominated by the Bible, there are \nmany medieval and early modern original texts in the language.

For instance, around 200 texts were written about indigenous Ethiopian saints from the 14th through the 19th centuries. This religious orientation of Ge’ez literature was a result of traditional education being the responsibility of priests and monks.\nIn addition to religion, works of history, ecclesiastical and civil law, philology, medi -\ncine, and letters were also written in Ge’ez. Although documents written in the Ge’ez \nlanguage are largely found in Ethiopia, we also find materials written in Ge’ez in foreign countries as well. Significant collections of Ethiopian manuscripts are found outside of Ethiopia in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States. The collection in the British Library comprises some 800 manuscripts dat-ing from the 15th to the 20th centuries, notably including magical and divinatory scrolls and illuminated manuscripts of the 16th to 17th centuries. It was initiated by a donation of 74 codices by the Church of England Missionary Society in the 1830s and 1840s, and substantially expanded by 349 codices looted by the British from Meqdela, the last stronghold of Emperor Tewodros II in the 1868 Expedition to Ethi-opia. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has at least two illuminated manuscripts in Ge’ez.\nBrainstorming Question\n»Why was the first mosque in Ethiopia established in the present-day Tigray region?\nThe Al Nejashi Mosque \nAl Nejashi Mosque is the oldest Muslim religious place of worship found in northern \nEthiopia in the present-day Tigray region. In the 7\nth century AD, the first followers \nof the Prophet Mohammed were persecuted and oppressed in their own land by the Quraysh ruling classes of Mecca for their conversion to the new religion, Islam. The Prophet Mohammed thus searched for a safe place and a compassionate king who could grant a safe hideout and protection for his followers. Realizing that he could not protect them from the attacks of the Quraysh ruling class of Mecca, Prophet Mo-hammed instructed his followers go to the Christian king of Habesha (Aksum) saying that Habesha is a land of justice and truth.\nAccordingly, in the year 615 A.D Prophet Muhammed sent a small group of his first"

The Quraysh ruling classes of Mecca had sent envoys to the Aksumite king with gifts demanding the ex -\ntradition of the first converts who were given refugee in Aksum. But the Aksumite king refused to accept the request of the Quraysh ruling classes of Mecca, that he would not extradite his guests even if they were to give him a mountain of gold.  The king rather assured the Muslims full protection saying to them ‘Go and live in peace, if anybody ill-treats you, he will pay heavily for it’. The then king of Aksum known as Ella Sham (or as Ashama b Abjar or Nejashi in Arabic sources) granted them asylum and permitted them to practice their religion freely until they left back to Arabia in 628 A.D.\nThe Al Nejashi Mosque, which is named after the king Negash, is said to be the first \nmosque not only in Ethiopia, but also, one of the oldest mosques in the world. It holds an important place in Islamic history and serves as an enduring reminder of the warm welcome extended to the first Muslims by the Ethiopian king of the time. It is also a sign that Ethiopia endorsed Islam first among the rest of Africa and most Arab countries, even before most of the people in Mecca.\nBrainstorming Questions\n»Which church was the first church in Ethiopia?\n»When and by whom was it established?\nAfter the end of the medieval tradition of roving capitals, the Ethiopian monarchs \nwere busy building palaces since the reigin of Emperor Fasileds. Of the modern Ethi -\nopian rulers, we can mention the palace of Emperor Yohannis IV of Mekele and that of Emperor Menelik II of Addis Ababa. But palaces were also built by other kings and rulers of other parts of Ethiopia as well.  \nJimma Abba Jifar’s PalaceIn the 18th century, King Abba Jifar II, the sixth ruler of a powerful Oromo-Muslim \ndynasty, established a palace in Jimma. He reigned from 1877 to 1933. He was the last king of the kingdom of Jimma and he is said to have spent for the construction of his palace 400 kgs of gold and 65,000 Marie-Therese Thaler, the Austrian currency that was widely used in Ethiopia. He nevertheless had to pay important taxes to Em -\nperor Menelik II. Aba Jifar had an impressive personality with a height of 2.10 m and"

The first floor is occupied by the court room and private apartments distributed around an inner courtyard. The complex is dominated by a watch tower whose windows open towards the neighboring provinces of Shewa, Kafa, and Wollega, as well as the town of Jimma below. If the whole is a little thin in furniture, the palace is worth it for its originality and for the point of view it offers on the city. The tomb of King Abba Jifar II is located on the road leading to the palace, about 1.5 km away.\nKumsa Moreda’s Palace Built by the hereditary ruler of Wollega in the 1870s, the Kumsa Moreda’s Palace has \nonly recently been opened to the public after long years of neglect. It is in 1 km dis -\ntance north of the Wollega Museum and served as residence to the prominent Worra Bekere family until they left the palace in Wollega to Addis Ababa during the Derg period.

The residence of Sheikh Hojele was confiscated in 1975 based on a proclamation that nationalized urban land and extra houses and was rented to people who needed houses to live in. Both the then government and the residents of this historic house were apparently unaware of the value of heritage, and the residence of Sheikh Hojele was given inad -\nequate attention. Thus, it was in very bad condition. Nowadays, the city government of Addis Ababa is working hard to conserve this heritage site.\nHalala Kella, of Dawuro"

In this area, traditional \nmusic was and still is played by mostly wandering musicians called azmaris, who are popular but not adequately respected by their society. As this form of music slowly \nspread across the country, it appropriated aspects of the regions it infiltrated, de-pending on the local customs, culture, and religion. During the time of Yared, ancient Christians adopted these traditions, embellishing them with tales from the Bible. Yared is said to have invented musical nota long before the Westerners.  The north-\nern parts of Ethiopia, particularly the Province of Wollo had an active role in the de -\nvelopment of secular music. The Four major Ethiopian melodies namely Bati, Tizeta, Ambassel and Anchihoye are the gifts of Wollo. The Ethiopian musicians play using their own musical instruments. Towards the north-eastern lowlands, a Muslim musi -\ncal form called manzuma was developed. Sung in ancient Amharic, over time manzu-ma spread to Harar and Jimma, where it is now sung in the Oromo language. Modern \nsecular Music was developing particularly as of the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie and the 1960s and 70s were the heydays of the Ethiopian modern music. It was in those decades that elite singers like Tilahun Gessesse, Ali Birra, Mahammud Ahmed, Alemayehu Eshete, Bizunesh Bekele, Hirut Bekle, Tamrat Molla and others became well known.\nEthiopian Art\nEthiopian art refers to any form of ancient and contemporary arttracing from the \n4th century to the present. One of the manifestations of Ethiopian art is dominance of Christian art. Christian arts exist in Ethiopia in forms including painting, cross-\nes, icons, illuminated manuscripts, and other metalwork such as crowns. There are"

Its history goes back al -\nmost three thousand years to the kingdom of Da’mat.\nAlthough some buildings and large, pre-Christian obelisks exist, there appears to be \nno adequate surviving Ethiopian Christian art from the Aksumite period. However, the earliest works remaining show a clear continuity with Coptic art of earlier peri -\nods. There was considerable destruction of churches and mosques during the Mus-lim-Christian Civil war of the 16\nth century. The revival of art after the Muslim-Chris -\ntian civil war was influenced by Catholic European art in both iconography and elements of style but retained its Ethiopian character. In the 20th century, Western artists and architects began to be commissioned by the government, and to train lo -\ncal students, and more fully Westernized art was produced alongside continuations of traditional church art. Meter Artist Afework Tekle, Eskender Bogosian, Gebrekris-tos Desta and Agegnehu Engida are some examples of prominent Ethiopia modern artists who produced excellent works of art particularly, painting.  \nEthiopian painting, on walls, in books, and in icons, is highly distinctive. It is typi -\nfied by simplistic figures with large eyes. Colors are usually bright and vivid. Most \npaintings are religious in nature, often decorating church walls or Bibles. Another important form of Ethiopian art, also related to Coptic styles, is crosses made from wood and metal. They are usually copper alloys orbrass, plated (at least originally) \nwith gold or silver.\nThe Lalibela Cross is an especially venerated hand cross, perhaps of the 12th centu-\nry, which was stolen from a church in Lalibela in 1997 and eventually recovered and returned by a Belgian collector in 2001. Distinctive forms of crowns were worn in ceremonial contexts by royalty and important noble officials, as well as senior clergy. Royal crowns rose high, with several circular bands, while church crowns often re-sembled an elongated version of the typical European closed crown, with four arms joined at the top and surmounted by a cross."

They then go around the entire village, expressing their thanks to each household in the community. The Ashenda girls spend around 20 minutes at each house, entertaining families, and themselves, be-fore being given farewell, usually with gifts of money, food, or drink. After the door-to-door celebrations, the Ashendiye or Solel girls find a suitable field in or near the village, spending anywhere from a day to a week dancing and playing in the field while passing men are urged to provide gifts of money. All money and gifts collected over the course of the celebration are then donated to a charity, the Church or other events. The Ashenda holiday is named after the long, thin ‘ Ashenda’ grass which girls tie to hang down from their waists in a fashionable pattern. The Ashenda grass has come to symbolise the cultural festival, as dancing girls move their waists, causing the leaves to shake in an eye-catching manner."

The \ncommemoration starts on the eve of the main festival on January 18. The eve is known as Ketera, which means blocking the flow of water for the blessing of the cel-ebrants. On the eve of Ketera, people escort their parish church tabot (replicas of the Ark of the Covenant) to Timket-Bahir (a pool, river or artificial reservoir), transport-ed by a priest of the parish and accompanied by a great ceremony. The people spend the night attending night-long prayers and hymn services, including the Eucharis-tic Liturgy. Hundreds of thousands participate in the actual festival on the following day, January 19. The celebration starts early in the morning with pre-sunrise rituals. These are followed by the sprinkling of the blessed water on the congregation as well as other ceremonies. At around 10 a.m., each tabot begins its procession back to its respective church, involving an even more colorful ceremony with various tradition -\nal and religious songs. \nMeskel (The Founding of the True Cross)\nThe festival of Meskel is celebrated across Ethiopia on 26 September to commem-orate the unearthing of the True Holy Cross of Christ. Celebrations begin with the building of the Demera bonfire – a conical bonfire of poles surrounded by bundles of branches and torches, decorated with green grass and Ethiopian seasonal flow -\ners including the yellow flower known as Adey Abeba, symbolizing the New Year. Hundreds of thousands of people from diverse communities flock to the square as colorfully dressed priests chant hymns and prayers and perform their unique rhyth-mic dance in front of the pyre. At the climax, the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church lights the bonfire. Meskel is celebrated nationwide regardless of age, gender, language or ethnicity. Participants are believed to receive spiritual re-wards from the celebration and blessings from the Holy Cross. Local churches play a key role in coordinating communities and safeguarding the element. The festival is also a time when families get together and migrant workers return home – reunions that result in the inflow of money, information, and new ideas from urban centers to rural areas. Prior to the celebration, personal quarrels and social disagreements must be resolved. In this way, Meskel is an occasion for Ethiopians to promote their spiritual life through reconciliation, social cohesion and peaceful coexistence. Meskel was registered by UNESCO as a World Heritage in September 2019."

It was perhaps this reality that enabled Harar to win the UNESCO medallion as a city of peace.\nThe fortified historic town of Harar and its surroundings are enriched with tremen-\ndous cultural treasures. As described earlier, the Jegol wall that surrounds the old town of Harar is an important element to mention here. The wall has five traditional gates, namely: Asadin Beri, Asum Beri, Argob Beri, Bedro Beri, and Sufat Beri. The 16\nth century wall of Harar was built to defend against a possible attack by the Oro -\nmos. The other structure is the Indian House, built by Indian merchants who came to Harar after 1887. It is also called the “Rimbaud House,” named after Arthur Rimbaud, a French poet who lived in Harar for ten years from 1881 to 1891. The traditional houses constitute other cultural sites in Harar. They comprise three rooms on the ground floor and service areas in the courtyard. Their inside parts are decorated with colorful basketry and textiles.\nThere are also many other cultural attractions in and around Harar, as described \nbelow. The handicrafts of the Harari people, which include weaving, basket making, and book binding, are impressive. The colorful traditional costume of Harari women is also attractive. Another important aspect of the cultural attractions in Harar is the fact that hyenas seem to be tamed. The hyena men that give meat to the hyenas with their hands and mouths are attractive.

Farm -\ners practice a balanced and integrated system of specialized agricultural technology. \nThe location of mainland Konso within mosquito-infested hot and dry lowlands at the edge of the Great East African Rift Valley led farmers to adopt intensive agricul -\nture. Farmers combined crop production with cattle breeding. At the same time, they adopted soil conservation techniques, notably the construction of terraces, which proved helpful in converting rugged and hilly areas into permanent cultivation. Farmers were also adept at selecting plant genes that withstood harsh climatic con-ditions. These terraces retain the soil from erosion and create terrace saddles that are used for agriculture. The terraces are the main features of the Konso landscape, and the hills are contoured by stone terraces that could reach, in some places, up to 5 m high. The terrace retention walls are built with heavier blocks at the base. The saddles that are prepared for agriculture are between four and eight meters wide at most places. Such complex agricultural practices enable farmers to produce suf-ficient food on a small plot of land for their sustenance. Besides agriculture, Konso’s economy depended on beekeeping and craftworks. All these activities attest to the ingenuity of local adaptation strategies. \nNational Parks \nThe Simen National Park\nThe Simen Mountain National Park was established in 1969.
