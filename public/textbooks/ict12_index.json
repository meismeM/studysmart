Increased consequences have been emerging which needs all user’s awareness about the use of information systems. The knowledge and skills about raising issues and proper use of information systems help students to become responsible members of society who can navigate a knowledge based and technology-led economy. This sub unit will focus on the major issues in use of information systems.\n1.1.1  Ethical and Legal Issues in Information Sy stem\nBrainstorming 1.1\n How could someone gain access to online banking account?  \n What would be the consequences of such access?  \nEthics is all about the principles of making right or wrong decisions. According to Britannica dictionary, ethics defined as, the discipline concerned with what is morally good and bad and morally right and wrong. Ethical principles needs to be respected and if not might result in legal consequences for those cases who are against the applied laws. The role of ethics in information systems has become more crucial as a result of technology. Questions related to ethics and legality are essential in many industries. Many professionals including medical and education professionals, government officials, and business people have legal and ethical oversight to control how their professions function. Information systems, by contrast, lack standard that align with ethical concerns in the current frequently changing and dynamic technological ecosystem. The ethical and legal issues include privacy, security, information gathering and digital ownership related concerns. You will learn about some of the main ethical and legal issues you need to know about as you participate in a constantly changing the digital world.The following are some ethical and legal issues confronting the current digital world."

However, personal accounts such as email, social media, and private bank accounts, can be accessed by unauthorized sources which create both ethical and legal concerns. It is morally wrong and unethical to view an individual’s private information in anyways which may also end up being a legal issue. All practices and attempts in organizations to check their employee’s computer habits also need to be implemented without incurring any damage to individual privacy.\nDigital Ownership:   It is ability to access and/or use and protect data, information, \nand knowledge about ourselves or things we own. The expansion of digital mediums  \nhas allowed information to flow more freely than before which makes content easily copied and pasted online. This makes digital ownership hard to control in the digital world. It is unethical to use somebody else’s digital works without getting permission from the owner first since it ignores the right of the creator. Creators has right to allow or deny the use of the contents. This permission can promote sharing of knowledge and information, credits the source and protect the consumer from false information. Users resources use should consider such concerns to promote proper use and dissemination of information, and to protect themselves from legal consequences that arises from violating intellectual property ownership rights. \nLinks  \nMore information about intellectual property and related concepts in detail in \nSection 1.2. of this book.  \nFigure  1.1 Privacy Issues\nFigure 1.2: Digital Ownership"

The \nmeasure has opened a debate about what \nand why information can be gathered. This issue raises a question of consent which protect individuals against attempts to steal information. \nUsers need to understand and examine the intention of any information-gathering \nrequest by any service providers or third-party applications while they use the \nservices. Such requests  need special attention if those organizations, systems, or \napplications request personal information and credentials. This protects against any illegal and fraudulent information stealing attempts.\nInformation Security and Liability:  Growing amounts of personal and financial \ninformation are being transferred and stored online as organizations and businesses \ndepend more and more on electronic data and computer networks to carry out their \ndaily operations. If and when a breach in information security happens, this might expose organizations and businesses to potential security liability.

As stated by Ethiopian Intellectual Property Office Establishment Proclamation, Proclamation No. 320/2003  “Intellectual property” means a legal right over a creative work of the human intellect and includes patent, trademark, registration certificate and copyright”.\nThere are essentially four types of intellectual property rights that are relevant to \nthe software and information system industry. These are :-trade secrets , patents, copyrights, and trademarks. We used World intellectual property organization (WIPO) definitions:\n•\tTrade secrets: “Trade secrets are Intellectual Property rights on confidential \ninformation which may be sold or licensed.  The unauthorized acquisition, use or disclosure of such secret information in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices by others is regarded as an unfair practice and a violation of the trade secret protection ”.\nFig 1.15:  Intellectual Property Right"

Generally \nspeaking, a patent provides the patent owner with the right to decide how - or whether - the invention can be used by others. In exchange for this right, the patent owner makes technical information about the invention publicly available in the published patent document’ ’. \nWhen a property owner holds a patent, others are prevented, under law, from offering for sale and making or using the product. \nExamples of patented products include software programs like Airbnb, \nAmazon, One-click, the page rank algorithm of Google, and other inventions including the light bulb, telephones, Bluetooth, and more. Not all software products can have a patent. The software has to meet certain standards to get a patent. These standards come from the responsible authority in each country. \nIn our country, the Ethiopian Intellectual Property Office is the legal entity \nto manage Intellectual property related applications. There are defined set of application procedures to follow in order to apply for patent. The application can be processed online through the application portal. \nYou can get detailed information, application and registration procedures \nfrom its official website (https://eipo.gov.et/) for all intellectual property right applications and questions."

However, if your rights under copyright protections are infringed, and you wish to file a lawsuit, then registration of your copyright will be necessary. Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) can also be registered for copyright.\n•\tTrademarks:  “A trademark is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods \nor services of one enterprise from those of other enterprises” . \nExample- ‘Meta’,‘RIDE’ and ‘Microsoft’ symbol–which nearly all could easily recognize and identify–are types of trademarks.

Bigdata refers to a collection of data sources that are so massive and complex that they become challenging to process using typical data processing software or readily available database management tools (See Figure 2.1).\nBigdata starts with the exponential explosion  in the amount of data we have \ngenerated since the dawn of the digital \nage. This is largely due to the rise of computers, the Internet, and technology capable of capturing information from the real and physical world we live in, and converting it to digital data that can benefit businesses and organizations (See Figure 2.2).\nIn Bigdata collection, the range of \norganizational sources generating data needs to be identified. These sources include business firms producing transactional data such as point-of-sale software, endpoint devices within IoT ecosystems and marketing firms, Social media posts from existing and prospective customers, multiple additional sources like smartphone locational data, surveys that directly ask customers for information are also some of the sources of Bigdata.

Granular information on rainfall patterns, water cycles, fertilizer needs, and other topics is made available to farmers through big data. They can use this information to make wise choices about when to harvest and what crops to grow for maximum profit. Making the proper choices ultimately increases agricultural outputs. \n• Manufacturing - In the manufacturing sector, Bigdata helps create a transparent infrastructure, predicting uncertainties and incompetence that can affect the business adversely (See Figure 2.9). \nFigure 2.7.

Cloud Computing \nBrainstorming 2.2\n Why do you think the name’ cloud’ is used  for cloud computing? \n2.2.1  Intr oduction to Cloud Computing\nCloud computing is defined as storing and accessing data and computing services \nover the Internet. It does not store any data on your personal computer. Computing services like servers, data storage, networking, databases, etc. are all available on-demand. The main advantage of cloud computing is it gives access to many users from single data center which allows users to store and access their data over the internet without any limitations. \nWe have all experienced cloud computing \nat some point. The goal of cloud computing is to provide easy and flexible access to computing resources and IT services, various which hardware and software components are required for the proper use of a cloud computing model.\nFigure 2.12.

User can restrict or enhance \nthe available resources while paying only for what is used. Another benefit is that resources can be shared, allowing users to collaborate in real-time on the same content in all domain and work environments (See Figure 2.14).\nUpdating and scalability – The service provider, as well as taking care of \nmaintenance, takes care of all service updates, which allow users  to focus more effectively on our work and responsibilities while increasing our efficiency . \nFigure 2.13.

Right from buying server hardware to hosting it in a data center, the process costs you lots of money and time. This was a common situation a decade  ago (See Figure 2.17). Now we have another alternative, a Cloud-based service to host our websites. \n \nOption 2. In Cloud-based services like website hosting, you do not need to buy new server hardware of your own rather you can borrow it for any time as long as you get at less price, which can save both money and time. Secondly, you do not have to manage operating systems and web services on your own, rather a cloud service provider manages them. You get a button to upload your website content, and once data is uploaded, your website content is available to the public.

Below are some of the limitations of cloud computing:   \n- Server downtime – No cloud provider can guarantee that you will not have \nservice interruptions, which will prevent you from accessing your data or files. Because cloud computing is dependent on an Internet connection, if it goes down, so will your cloud services. \n- Security and privacy issues – When it comes to handling sensitive data, companies are always concerned about how safe and private it is. There is still a risk of intruders, even though a cloud provider would have security processes in place to ensure that your data is maintained and protected properly. Intruders are constantly attempting to find new ways to break into cloud providers’ systems in today’s digital world. Therefore, cloud computing services are not completely safe.\n- Data ownership and transparency – Companies may think that there is a lack of transparency concerning data ownership. Does data that is uploaded to a cloud computing system become the cloud provider’s property? Another concern is lack of data openness. Companies may be concerned about how their data is managed and whether it is being compromised or not.\n- Inflexibility – Some cloud computing providers may take a corporation off guard by requiring the usage of their applications and formats. For example, they can limit that a corporation can only upload data developed"

Because the cloud provider has complete \ncontrol over your cloud service infrastructure, they have ultimate authority over how your data is handled.\n- Lack of support  – Cloud-based services, in comparison to other hosting \nservices and providers, provide minimal to no customer assistance. Customers who are unable to contact cloud providers by phone or email frequently turn to Internet forums for answers to their questions.\n- Cost – Another disadvantage of this service is the unknown fees.

Overview of Relational Database Management System\nBrainstorming 3.1\n What is a relational database management system?\nThe term Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) usually refers to \nvarious types of software systems developed in order to manage databases. RDBMS is used to create, maintain, and provide controlled access to a relational database. \nA relational database is based on a relational data model. Data are stored in a two-\ndimensional table, which contains columns or fields and rows or records. Each column of a table represents an attribute or data value, and each row in a table represents a tuple or record. \nA database contains one or more tables that maintain records. Attributes are the set \nof properties to describe the instances of the entity. For example, a student can be an entity. The attributes of a student can be described in terms of student id, name, age, grade level and sex. The table shown in Figure 3.1 below has five attributes (or pieces of data).   A record is a row or a tuple in the table. It contains a single data value in each column.\nFigure 3. 1 Example table with fields and records\nEach field in a table has to be given a name and data type. A data type is the type of data value you want to store in the field. For example, to populate this database you would use residence id to populate the residence id field. Here, we know that a residence id is mentioned as a four-digit number. The second field, first name, is used to store the first name. Name is an attribute stated in text form. one record/ \ntuple"

The data types include text, integer, real numbers, dates, currency and yes or no fields (See Figure 3.2). \nFigure 3.2 Sample data type in MS Access\nLinks  \nSee Table 3.3 in section 3.2.2 of this unit for detailed descriptions of data types \nin MS Access."

Given a patient table,write three fields and their data types to describe a patient. \nThe database in Figure 3.3 below has five tables: Students, MarkList, Subject, \nSubjectAssigned and Teachers. For example, the ‘Students’  table contains three \nfields: Sid, SName and FName. These are attributes that describe the student entity. The Students  table has four records of which the first record has data value of \nS001, Chaltu, and Gemeda. In the Students  table, the field Sid is a primary key. \nThe data value of Sid is unique, meaning that a record with Sid S001 cannot be duplicated. In relational database, each table that has a key field (primary key) uniquely identifies each record. This key field can be used to create relationship and link one table of data to another. The Students  table is linked with MarkList \nthrough the Sid field. This table, MarkList, consists of students’ marks for the enrolled courses. A student who took four courses could have four mark records with same Sid (e.g. S004 in MarkList). Therefore, Sid in the table MarkList is not a unique key or primary key. The Sid in MarkList is referred to as a foreign-key. This key is used to create a relationship with the Students  table which contains Sid \nas primary key.    \nRelational databases are the most popular databases  have been widely used for \nmore than four decades.

Option 1 is used \nwhen the values of all fields are to be replaced by new values, whereas Option 2 is used when only selected fields are to be replaced.\nNotes\nDid you know that while using the INSERT INTO command, the column value should match the column data type of the table (e.g., you cannot insert a text value into a numerical field). All string values to be inserted in a table should be quoted with single or double quotation marks (e.g. ‘Chemistry’ or “Chemistry”). But if the field is defined as numeric, like Age INT, the value to be inserted does not need quotation marks(e.g. 20).   \nOption 1:\nINSERT INTO table_name  V ALUES (value1, value2, value3 ...)\nOption 2:INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2…)  V ALUES (value1, \nvalue2 …)\nExample 1: Insert into a COURSE table\nINSERT INTO COURSE V ALUES (3, ‘Chemistry’, ‘Organic chemistry’, \n‘105’, ‘NS1421’);\nThe above example inserts a record into a COURSE table.

Accordingly, each value listed in the INSERT command is inserted into the corresponding column in the COURSE table.

Introduction to XML \nBrainstorming 4.1\n What comes to your mind when you hear the term ‘markup language’?  \nThe eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language like HTML. A \nmarkup language is a computer language that uses tags enclosed with less than (<) \nand greater than (>) symbols to define elements within a document. When the file is processed by a suitable application, the tags are used to control the structure or presentation of the data contained in the file. Any text that appears within one of these tags is considered part of the markup language. Markup files contain standard \nwords, rather than typical programming  syntax.  \nActivity 4.1\n• Describe  one fact about XML.\nXML  is a way of applying structure to a web page. XML provides a standard open \nformat and mechanisms for structuring a document so that it can be exchanged and manipulated. XML complements your HTML knowledge by allowing you to structure your data by marking up the text and data to define the data content.    \nXML is used for storing structured  data, rather than formatting information on a \npage. While HTML documents use predefined tags (such as “ <head>”, “<title> ” ), XML files use custom tags to define elements. \nMicrosoft Rich Text Format (RTF), Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), and \nHTML are types of markup languages that provide presentational markup. They are powerful solutions to the problem of displaying information. Their common limitation is that they describe how the data looks, but they do not give any information about what it is.\nLike HTML, XML uses tags to “mark-up” data content. Unlike HTML, in XML \nyou define your own tags that meet the exact needs of your document. The custom"

Therefore, XML is used to describe the structure of a document rather than the way it is presented.\nThe two areas in which XML is useful are structuring data for storage, where a \nrelational database (See Unit Three about database) is inappropriate, and the presentation of web pages. For example, a system is handling small quantities of data, or if the data lacks a relational structure, programmers usually prefer to create their own data formats, i.e. XML.\nActivity 4.2\n1.

XML declaration: describes the general characteristics of the document, \nsuch as XML document, the version of the XML, and the encoding character \nit uses.  XML documents usually begin with the XML declaration statement \ncalled the processing instructions which provide information on how the XML \nfile should be processed. E.g. <?XML  version= “1.0”  encoding=“UTF-8 ”?> \nThe processing instruction statement uses the encoding property to specify the encoding scheme used to create the XML file. Encoding is the process of converting Unicode character into their binary equivalent representation depending on the type of encoding(‘UTF-8’ or ‘UTF-16’).\n2. Document Type Declaration (DTD):  describes the structure of the document \nin terms of which elements it may contain, along with any restrictions it may have. In other words, it describes the root.

They are the building blocks of an XML document. E.g. <last>Kebede</last>\n9. Data: XML elements can contain data between the start and the end tags. An \nXML document represents information using a hierarchy. That means, it begins with a root element (e.g. people), which contains sub-elements (e.g. person) which in turn can contain other sub-elements(e.g. name), data (e.g. Kebede), or \nboth.  E.g. Abebech, Kebede, Jemal,  and Ahmed are data.\nBesides the above elements, attributes and comments are also part of XML documents. Attribute: Like HTML, XML elements can contain attributes. An attribute provides \nadditional information about the elements for which it is declared. It consists of a name-value pair. In the following example, the attribute name is personid and the \nvalue is “101”. The attribute value should be quoted: single or double quotes can be used. E.g. <name  personid = “101”>Ubang </name>\nComment: This is a kind of note or statement that is used to describe the XML \ncode. Comments can provide documentation information about the XML file or the application to which the file belongs. A comment is ignored by the XML parser(or a program that interpretes XML instruction) during code execution.  The syntax for a comment is:  <!-- This is a comment -->\nWe can see the whole hierarchy of the above markup in an upside-down tree struc -\nture, as shown in Figure 4.4."

XML elements are case sensitive\nA. <name>Ibrahim</ Name> is wrong \nB. <NAME>Ibrahim</ Name> is wrong \nC. <Name>Ibrahim</Name> is correct \n3. All elements should not overlap, and they  must  properly be nested within each \nother. \nA. <Name><Student>Almaz</ Name></Student> is wrong \nB. <Student><Name>Almaz</Student></ Name> is wrong \nC. <Student><Name>Almaz</ Name></Student> is correct\n4. XML attribute values must always be quoted. The XML elements can have \nattributes in name-value pairs which are similar to HTML.\n<note date=”12/11/2007”> \n  <to>Gebre</to>  \n  <from>Almaz</from>  \n</note>\n5.

Entity References: In XML, some characters have special meaning. For example, a character like “<” inside an XML element will generate an error. This is because the XML parser interprets “<” as the start of a new XML element. See the example below: \n<Message>if salary <1000 then</Message> This generates an XML error:\nTo avoid this error, replace the “<” character with an entity reference as:\n<Message>if salary &lt; 1000 then</Message> This is correct\nThere are 5 pre-defined entity references in XML.

Elements are surrounded by tags like  HTML. \nThe content of the document has a structure imposed by the rules of XML although this structure is quite loose. Each document has a single root element that contains all of the other markups. You have already learned this point in HTML where all documents are enclosed inside <html></html> tags. The document is then composed of several sections, each of which is enclosed between tags. The sections themselves are also elements.\nAn XML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag’s of the element. \nAn element without content is said to be empty element. An empty element can be \ndescribed in one of the following options. \n<element></element> <element />\nNaming rules of XML elements:\n• Element names are case-sensitive.\n• Element names must start with a letter or underscore.\n• Element names cannot start with the letters XML.\n• Element names can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and \nperiods.\n• Element names cannot contain spaces.\nAny name can be used, but no words are reserved (except XML).\nAn element can contain:\n• Text\n• Attributes\n• Other Elements, or \n• A mix of the aboveExample of XML\n<Bookstore>\n<Book  category=”children”>\n<title> Stories and Parables</title>\n<author>Kebede Michael </author><year>2007</year><price>Birr 150.00 </price>\n</Book>\n</Bookstore>\nFigure 4. 7 XML Elements vs Examples"

E.g. Kebede Michael.\n• <Bookstore> and <Book> have  element contents because they contain \nelements.\n• <Book> has an  attribute. E.g. category=”children”.\nAttribute Declarations: An XML element, like HTML, can have attributes. The \nelement’s attributes define data related to a specific element. Attributes provide \nadditional information about the element. An attribute is defined as key-value pair: \nthe key is the name (e.g. gender) and the attribute has values that must always be quoted (e.g. “female”) . Either single quotation marks (‘ ’) or double quotation \nmarks (“ ”) can be used. For example, a person element’s gender can be written like this:\n<person  gender= “female”>or <person  gender= ‘male’>\nIf the value of the attribute itself contains double quotation marks, use single quotation marks\n, as shown in this example:\n<person  name= ‘Tilahun Gessesse “KomeLimerkish( ቆሜልመርቅሽ)”’ >\nXML Elements vs. Attributes\n<person  gender=”female”>  \n<firstname>Anna</firstname>  \n  <lastname>Smith</lastname>\n</person><person>\n<gender>female</gender>  \n<firstname>Anna</firstname>  \n  <lastname>Smith</lastname>\n</person>\nFigure 4. 8 XML Elements vs. Attributes\nIn the first example of Figure 4.8, gender is an attribute.

The internal (parsed) entity declaration will be discussed for our purpose.  \nThe purpose of internal parsed entities is generally to refer to text. It refers to data that an XML processor has to parse. \nSyntax for creating entity declaration Example \n<!ENTITY name “value”> <!ENTITY publisher  “Berhanena Selam Printing”>\nFigure 4. 9 Entity Declaration\nThere are two parts to entities. The first is an entity declaration of a  name that tie the \nreplacement content. The above example declares an entity of the name  ‘publisher ’. \nThe name ‘publisher’ is associated with the content of “Berhanena Selam Printing”.The second is using the name defined in the entity declaration subsequently in the XML as shown below. When the entity name is used in XML, it is called an entity reference. \n<author>Addis Alemayehu</author>\n<pubinfo>Published by &publisher;</pubinfo>\nWhen the parser subsequently encounters an ampersand symbol (i.e. &) and \nsemicolon (i.e. ;) which identify a general entity reference, the parser looks up that name in an entity declaration table (See Figure 4.9). In our case, the \nreference,  &publisher;  is replaced by the content that it represents.

There are many players that include separate audio controls for audio and video. Ensure that the player’s volume is set to the highest setting and that the sound is switched on. Check that external speakers are plugged in, switched on, and connected to the appropriate audio port or a USB port if the issue persists (See Figure 5.7). Make sure the wireless headphones are successfully paired and connected in this scenario. Sound drivers’ difficulties can also be related to the other prevalent causes.

Network Troubleshooting \nBrainstorming 5.4\n What are the possible causes for Internet network disconnection?\nTwo or more computers connected together to share resources (such printers and \nscanners), exchange files, or enable electronic communications make up a network. A network’s connections to its computers can be made by cables, phone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared laser beams.\nThe collection of techniques and procedures used to locate, analyze, and fix issues \nin a computer network is known as network troubleshooting. Network engineers and technicians use a logical procedure to fix issues with networks and enhance network performance.\nWhen you run a network or while working in any system, there are always chances \nof failure in the smooth operation owing to technical, physical, or any other faults. For the uninterrupted running of the system, you need to resolve these raised issues as soon as possible. Therefore, you need to detect the cause of the problem first and then fix it. The process of detection, minimization, and resolving the faults that arise in the network while performing the various day-to-day activities is known as network troubleshooting.\nBecause of the variety of network hardware, network configurations, operating \nsystems, and setups, not all the following information may not apply to your network or operating system, but it is recommended to check the following common issues in network troubleshooting\nNotes\n Network problems happen when something disrupts the connection \nbetween your computer and the content you are trying to access."

Sometimes a network can \nhave multiple problems. This is the time to identify each issue so that your solutions to one is not bogged down by other unsolved problems.\n•\tDevelop a Scenario\nOnce you have finished gathering all the information that you can about the network issue or issues, it is time to develop a working scenario. Sometimes a network outage occurs because someone tripped on a wire or some other simple problem. \n•\tTest the Scenario\nUsing the tools at your disposal, test your scenario. If your scenario is that the network router is defective, try replacing it with another router to see if that fixes the issue. \nNotes\n At this stage, it is important to remember that proving your own theories wrong does not mean that you have failed. Instead, you return to step two, develop a new scenario, and then find a way to test that one.  \n•\tPlan of Action\nCome up with a plan of action to address the problem. Sometimes your plan can include just one step. For example, restart the router.

More than a hundred programming languages have been introduced since the introduction of the computer. Programming languages are designed with a specific purpose. Like human languages, programming languages have their own specific set of rules called syntax, which define how to write instructions in that language. Python relies on indentation to define scope and uses new lines to complete a command. The semantics of a Python program refers to the meaning of the set of rules. In Grade 11, you were introduced to programming language and its generation, basic syntax in python, and program writing.\nIn this unit, additional language constructs and concepts that can help you \ndevelop a program in Python are introduced.

Program Flow Controls and Syntax in Python\nBrainstorming 6.1\n In what order do instructions in a Python program execute?\nA program  flow control  is the order in which the program’s code executes. In \nPython, the flow control of the program is regulated by the implementation of three \ntypes of programming language constructs or program logic, namely sequential , \nbranching, and loop. The sequential flow control consists of a simple list of \nstatements that are to be executed in the order given. Everything you learnt about declaring variables, printing output, and reading input from the keyboard in Grade 11 are sequential statements. In this unit, the implementation of the remaining two language constructs: conditional and loop flow controls are focused. \nActivity 6.1\n• Discuss the three types of programming language constructs and connect them with real-world problems.\n6.1.1  Conditionals Pr ogram Flow Controls\nBrainstorming 6.2\n “If it rains, then I will take an umbrella.” – what type of statement is this? \nIn some cases, you may need a program to choose one out of two or more alternatives, depending on the input given. For example, suppose you design a program that determines whether the given number is even or odd. An even number is a number divisible by two without a remainder, whereas an odd number is divisible by two with a reminder. We can describe the problem with the following mathematical equation which is called expression in python.\n• num % 2 = 0  num is Even, for num any integer number. \n• num % 2 ≠ 0  num is Odd, for num any integer number."

Python provides conditional or branching statement to implement such solutions. Before starting conditional statements, it is important to learn conditional expressions in Python. \nConditional Expression\nConditional expressions are statements that use Boolean operators (such as \nAND, OR, NOT) or comparison operators (such as >,<. ≠).  Like in mathematics, comparisons of two values in Python are described with comparison signs used in mathematics. Table 6.1 below presents comparison expressions in Python and Mathematics. \nTable 6. 1 Conditional Expression\nDescription Comparisons in Python Comparisons in Math-\nematics\nEquals  \nNot Equals or inequality \nLess than  \nGreater than\nLess than or equal to   \nGreater than or equal to   a == b\na != b\na < b\na > b\na <= b\na >= ba = ba ≠ b\na < b\na > b\na ≤ b\na ≥ b\nThe comparisons in Table 6.1 are also called conditional expressions that correspond \nto the Boolean values - true or false. For example, 3==4 results in false (as 3 is not equal to 4). Note that operators used in python’s expressions are slightly different from operators used in Mathematics (e.g. == vs. =, != vs. ≠ ). Python conditionals can be used in several ways, most commonly in ‘if statements’ and loop statements."

Thus, \nthe even/odd problem discussed earlier can be accomplished with the following python statement: \n \nIn the above program, first the expression num % 2 == 0 is evaluated (checked). If num % 2 is true (condition satisfied), then the statement following (print (num, “is Even number”) is executed. Otherwise, which means the condition num % 2 == 0 has not satisfied (or false), then the statement following else (print(num, “ is Odd number”) is executed. Now it is time to learn additional syntax rules in python. \nSyntax in a python program is a set of rules that defines how a python program is \nwritten and interpreted. For instance, the expression of an ‘if statement’ must be followed by a colon (:). Some programming languages require expressions to be enclosed in parenthesis, but in python it is optional. So in python, “if num % 2 == 0:” or “if (num % 2 == 0):”, this complies to Python’s syntax rule. \nAnother important syntax in python is indentation. In Figure 6.3, it is  noted that \nthe ‘yes_statements’ and ‘no_statements’ must be indented. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. While in other programming languages the indentation in code is only for readability, the indentation in Python is very important. \nPython uses indentation to indicate a block of code. For example, if you ignore the \nindentation in the example ‘if statement’ above, and begin the yes_statements or"

For example, consider the program you designed in (Activity 6.6 Question 2) that determines the student’s mark as “Excellent”, “Very Good”, etc. If you have 50 students in a class, then a more complete program would repeat this status determination 50 times (i.e. once for each student in the class). A program is often used to automate such repetitive tasks. A portion of program code that repeats a statement or group of statements in programming is called loop.  \nLoops are set of statements that run repeatedly for a fixed number of times, or until \na condition is satisfied. Loop statements control a block of code to be executed iteratively or until a certain condition fails. Loops are a useful and frequently used feature in all modern programming languages. Python provides several language features to make iteration/looping easier. There are two types of loops that are built into Python: for loops  and while loops. In the following section, implementation of  \n‘for loop’ is discussed and then followed by ‘ while loop’ in python.\nfor loops: The for loop in python is used to iterate over a sequence. For loop in \ncombination with the Python’s range() function is used for counting in all kinds of ways (See for loop with range function at the end of this section). The for loop in python differs a bit from other like C or Pascal. In Python for loop  is used to iterate \nover the items of any sequence including the python list, string, tuple, dictionary, etc. It is also used to access elements from a container (e.g. list, string, tuple) using a built-in function range(). The general syntax of for loop is as follows."

You can think of the interpreter as a layer of a program that works between your program and your computer hardware to get your code running. Python has a wide range of interpreters including IDLE, CPython, Jython, PyPy, and IronPython and online Python editors. Your Python source code is always run by one of these interpreters depending on the Python installation you use. Therefore, first, make sure that you have correctly installed one of these interpreters on your computer.\nLinks  \nRead your Grade 11 IT Textbook for more on Python IDE"

Compilation is a  \nsimple translation process that generates a bytecode. In Python a compiled code is \nusually stored in a file with the extension of  .pyc, which can update when necessary. \nThen, the  bytecode  (.pyc file) is loaded into the Python runtime and interpreted by \na Python Virtual Machine (PVM). The PVM is the Python runtime powerhouse. \nThe PVM is a piece of program that reads each instruction in the  bytecode  one \nby one and executes whatever operation is indicated. Bytecode interpretation is \nautomatic, and the PVM is just part of the Python system that you have installed \non your machine. The PVM is the component that truly runs your scripts. Running \nyour program is just the last step of what is called the  Python interpreter process. \nActivity 6.19\n• Describe the steps involved in the python interpreter process."

Testing and Debugging Programs\nBrainstorming 6.6\n Why do we need to test a program?\nOnce you write your program source code, you save the file and run the code to \ntest whether the desired or expected output is generated. The program sometimes \nfails to run correctly because of a bug. A  bug is an unexpected problem in your \nprogram. Bugs can appear in many forms, and some are more difficult to fix than others. Some bugs are tricky enough that you will not be able to catch them by just reading through your program. Luckily, Python IDLE provides some basic tools \nthat help you  debug  your programs with ease. Debugging means, having complete \ncontrol over the program execution.   \nGetting Started Interpreter DEBUG Mode\nIf you want to run your code with the built-in debugger in Python IDLE, you \nneed to turn to debug mode feature. To do so, select  Debug → Debugger  from the \nPython IDLE menu bar. In the interpreter, you should see  [DEBUG ON]  appear \njust before the prompt (>>>), which means the interpreter is ready and waiting (See \nFigure 6.29 below).\nWhen you run your Python file, the debugger window appears (See Figure 6.29 \nbelow):"
