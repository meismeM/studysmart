A \ncomputer file can be both system generated and created or transferred from other sources in to a computer. You will learn how to manipulate files (creating, copying, renaming, deleting and searching).\nA file folder is a mechanism to keep your computer files in an organized \nmanner. This unit will deal with folder manipulation mechanisms that operating systems provide. \n1.1 Basics of Files and Folders At the end of this unit, learners will be able to:\n Explain file, folder and drive.\n Manipulate file and folder.\n Explore drive on computer system.\nUNIT \nORGANIZATION OF FILES\nUNIT OUTCOMES1 \n \n Brainstorming \n1.  Have you ever visited your family’s “edir” or “ekub” association’s membership information? Do they use paper to keep membership information? \n2. What do you think are the limitations of using the above manual filing system (shelf or filing cabinet-based filing system)? Do you think computers are used to store such information?"

It can be \na Word, Spreadsheet, PowerPoint Presentation document that you had learnt in Grade 8. Files are represented by an icon in a computer. Thus, icons are small graphical representation of a file. Because there are different file formats, icons are usually used to help identify the type of file or program associated with. In Figure 1.1 below, you can see different types of files on the desktop.\nFigure 1.1 Common File Icons in Window 10\nKEY CONCEPTS\n /u270D_1F3FFA file stores a data which can be a document, a picture, text, video, audio, etc.\n /u270D_1F3FFA file has different icons in a computer.  \n1.1.2  Folders\nA folder, also called a directory, is a container which is used to store related files together.

Form a group of two to five students in a class and discuss the following questions. \n1. Present the way you put things in your home such as your cloths, exercise books and text books. Compare and contrast a messy home and a tidy home. Which one is easy to locate things?  \n2. In analogous to this, compare and contrast cluttered files shown in Figure 1.3 (a) and organized files in folder shown in Figure 1.3 (b).  \n3.

This helps to locate files easily. If you had no folders on your computer, your documents, programs and operating system files would all be located in the same place. Folders allow you to have more than one file with the same file name. For instance, you can have a file called My-letter.doc in your My Documents folder and another file called My-letter.doc in a different folder called ’Letter collection’. If all your files were in a single place, every file would need a unique file name."

Switch is more intelligent device than hub as it can segment a computer network into smaller parts. In addition, switch forwards packets to specific destination after learning the network topology. To perform this, switch uses a table which contains computer physical address and switch port number  on \nwhich a computer connected on. A hub is unintelligent device which broadcasts all received packets to all computers connected to it except the sender.\nFigure 2.5 a) 24 port switch                                       b) Switch on a network\nd. Router\nConsider yourself as a taxi driver in a given town which has a lot or streets (roads) interconnected. Think about the driver when he or she selects a particular street from many different options available to reach to his or her destination. What factors does he or she consider? The distance? The traffic jam or number of cars in a certain road segment? Which road segment would take him or her where? What else, he or she might think of? \nA router is such an intelligent device which operates in determination of \npathways for electronic messages in networks. A router, as its name suggests, works with routing or finding a route through a network. That is, it is a router of a network. The main objective of router is to connect dissimilar and different networks simultaneously as shown in below Figure 2.6. As shown in the figure, there are two network segments, each connected to a switch. The two switches are connected to each other through the router. Assume two different cases."

It refers to the physical arrangement of devices in a network. Typical network configurations include bus topology, mesh topology, star topology, and ring topology (See Figure 2.16).\nFigure 2.16 Network topologies\na. Bus Topology\nIn bus topology, there is a long cable called bus which acts as a backbone for \nall the nodes as shown in Figure 2.17. A bus topology network connects each computer or electronic devised to a backbone cable (or bus) just like a water pipe interconnections. \nFigure 2.17 Bus topology"

However, fault \nisolation becomes very difficult in bus topology. It is also relatively difficult to add new nodes to a bus, thus making it more inflexible. This is because addition of a node changes the number of taps and the average distance between them, which are generally optimized for a bus length. Another demerit is that, even if a portion of the bus breaks down, the whole bus cannot function.\nb. Mesh Topology\nIn mesh topology (also called complete topology), each node is connected to every other node by direct links. Figure 2.18  illustrates this.\nMesh topology does not have traffic congestion problems due to dedicated \nlinks. This topology has the advantage in terms of data security. It is also robust; that means, if one link is down, the rest of the network can still continue. Fault identification is also easy in this case. The main demerit of this network scheme is cable length and consequent cost and complexity. This is clearly impractical for medium to large networks. \nFigure 2.18 Mesh topology"

The devices are not directly linked to one another. Unlike a mesh topology, a star topology does not allow direct traffic between devices. If a node wants to send some data to another node, it sends it to this switch. The switch, in turn, sends it to the appropriate node as Figure 2.19 depicts.\nStar topology is cheaper than mesh topology. It is also relatively easier to \ninstall, maintain and reconfigure. It is also robust. However, if the switch goes down, the entire network becomes defunct. This is a major demerit of this scheme.\nFigure 2.19 Star topology \nd. Ring Topology\nIn ring topology, each node is directly connected to only its two adjacent neighbors. If a node wants to send something to a distant node on a ring, it has to go through many intermediate nodes, which act like repeaters, reproducing the incoming bit stream with full signals on the outgoing line. Figure 2.20  depicts this topology."

These are end devices, intermediate devices, connection medium and protocol.\n End devices are the sender and the receiver which can be any devices capable of composing, sending and receiving a message. \n Intermediate devices are interconnecting devices that found between end devices, as their name indicates. Intermediary device includes network cards, routers or network switches, modems and Ethernet repeaters.\n Network interface card (NIC) is used to plug a UTP cable to the computer. It has wireless variety which allows a computer to connect to the network wirelessly.\n Repeaters, as the name indicates, repeat and boost the signal. It accepts weak signal on one port, illuminates the noise that makes signal week, regenerates signals and resends the boosted, cleared signal over the other port.  It has an analog version, which is also called Amplifier. \nAmplifier amplifies not only the signal but also the noise and sends it again.   \n Switch is more intelligent device than repeater because after learning the network, it forwards packet to the destined port or a device connected to the port only.  \n A router is a device that connects different types of network and more intelligence than switch.\n Router uses routing tables.\n Router selects best path through networks.\n Protocol is a common set of rules to manage communication (packet transmission) through a network. \n Connection media used in networks are wired (guided) and wireless (unguided) media. \n UTP is the most common wired medium used in local area networks."

LAN can be a small office, one campus or school, network. \n MAN convers area of a city and can contain multiple LANs.\n WAN covers very large area such as the globe. \n Network topologies include bus, star, ring and mesh topologies. \n A bus topology is a cheap network where computers are connected to a common backbone cable. \n In a mesh topology, every computer in a network is connected to each other independently. Mesh topology needs more cable and more ports on the computer. \n In star topology, all computers are connected separately to a central device, which can be a switch. A failure of the central device results in a failure of the entire network. \n Ring topology looks like finger ring that connects devices in such a way that each device is connected to other two adjacent devices.  Failure of one node in ring topology network will affect the whole network. \n Peer-to-peer and client-server networks are based on resource access and sharing.\n In peer-to-peer network, resources are distributed among peers and each peer can be a server and client at the same time. \n In client server, resources to be shared over the network are adminis -\ntered centrally and there is a dedicated server which provides resources called servers and there is also a dedicated client which requests a re-\nsource from the server."

When we are working on multiple pages, word automatically starts a new \npage in long documents when the text reaches the bottom of the page. In some cases, for example, some statements which are part of a paragraph can extend to the next page which makes it uncomfortable to read. \nYou can let Word determine where the break will occur, and you can also \ndecide where to insert a manual page break or set specific options for those page breaks. Manual page breaks display as a single dotted line when the Word’s Page Break appears in the center when you enable the Show/Hide button (as shown in Figure 3.35). In Print Layout view, Word displays a document page-by-page, one after the other. In this section, you will learn how to insert and remove a manual page break. The Breaks menu contains options for inserting three types of breaks:\n Page Inserts: Inserts a manual page break where one page ends and the new page begins.\n Column: Inserts a manual column break where a text will begin in the next column after the column break.\n Text Wrapping: Separates the text around objects on a web page, such as \ncaption text from body text.\nTo insert and delete a page break in a document, keep the following steps.\n1. Write the following document, which has a paragraph description for a picture in page 7 and a picture in another page (page 8) of the document, due to Word’s automatic break (See Figure 3.33). So, we need to make the description paragraph along with the picture in the same page (page 8) manually by breaking the page. It is possible to just press Enter until that text reaches the top of page eight, but it could easily be shifted around when we added or deleted something in another part of the document. Instead, we will insert a page break."

An example of spreadsheet software is Excel. As you have learned in grades 7 and 8, Microsoft Office Excel provides powerful tools that enable users to organize, analyze, manage and share information easily.\nOne of the most powerful features of Excel is its ability to calculate numerical \ninformation using formulas. Excel can add, subtract, multiply and divide. In this section, we see how to use cell references to create simple formulas.\n3.3.1  Using Mathematical Operators\nExcel uses standard operators, such as a plus sign for addition (+), a minus sign for subtraction (-), an asterisk for multiplication (*), a forward slash for division (/) and a caret (^) for exponents, for formulas.\nTable 3.4  Mathematical operators of Excel\nArithmetic Operator Meaning Example\n+ (plus sign) Addition =3+3\n– (minus sign) Subtraction =3–3\n* (asterisk) Multiplication =3*3\n/ (forward slash) Division =3/3\n% (percent sign) Percent 30%\n^ (caret) Exponentiation =3^3\nWhen you enter a formula in a cell, the formula is stored internally and the results are displayed in the cell. You can view the underlying formula in the formula bar when the cell is active, when you double-click the cell to edit it or when you use the Formulas tab.\nTo allow Excel to distinguish formulas from data, all formulas should begin \nwith an equal sign (=). To display formula in Excel, follow the following steps.\n1. Launch Microsoft Excel and then open a new blank workbook.\n2. Click cell A1.\n3. Type =5+3*3/2-4 and press Enter. You just entered a formula.\nTake note that formulas should be typed without spaces, but if you type spaces, Excel eliminates them when you press Enter."

Each cell in an Excel worksheet has a unique identifier indicating its column and row, for example A1 (refers to Column A, Row 1) and E4 (refers to Column E, Row 4). When you create a formula, you can reference a cell’s identifier rather than typing the number that appears in that cell. Using a cell reference, rather than the data displayed in a cell, gives you more flexibility in your worksheet. Using cell references will ensure that your formulas are always accurate because you can change the value of referenced cells without having to rewrite the formula. For example, if the cell E1 contains the number 10 and if 10 is changed to 18 later, any formula that references cell E1 updates automatically. The same principle applies to a cell that contains a formula and is referenced in another formula.\n3.3.3  Using Relative Cell References in Formula\nA relative cell reference is the one that adjusts the cell identifier automatically when you insert or delete columns or rows or copy the formula to another cell. A relative cell reference is, therefore, one whose references change “relative” to the location where it is copied or moved.\nYou can use either uppercase or lowercase when you type a cell refer -\nence in a formula. For example, it does not matter whether you type B4 or b4 in the formula you enter. Excel changes the reference to up -\npercase when you press Enter.\nTo use relative cell references in formulas, follow the following steps.\n1. Launch Microsoft Excel and type 5 students’ IT subject marks on a new work book, as shown in Figure 3.47. \n2. In order to calculate the total marks (out of 100 %) of Individual Assignment, Mid Exam, Projects and Final Exam for each student, click on cell that will contain formula. In our example, click F2. \n3. Type equal (= ) sign to start the formula; notice how it appears in both the cell and the formula bar."

A blue border will appear around the referenced cell.\nTipAn alternate way to use a cell reference is to click the cell being referenced while creating or modifying a formula. For example, instead of typing B and 2 from the \nkeyboard, you can click on B2 cell, and then B2 cell reference is added into the formula. This method is usually quicker and eliminates the possibility of typing an incorrect cell identifier, especially if you need to create a formula with many cell references.\n5. Type the mathematical operator you want to use. In our example, we will type the addition sign (+) (See Figure 3.47).\n6.

His mother ordered him to buy 1 kilo potato, ½ kilo sugar, 1 kilo onion, ½ kilo banana, ¼ kilo coffee bean and ½ kilo salt from a small local market, called gulit, found around his village. The price information is provided in the following Excel sheet (See Table 3.5 below). We want to create a formula that will multiply each item’s price by the quantity. \n1. Create a single formula that calculates the total price for each item in cell E3, and then copy it to the other rows. \n2. In response to question number 1 above, we calculated total price in column E without tax. Now we will use 15% sales tax rate in cell G1 to calculate the sales tax for all items in column F (See Table 3.6). Create a formula that will calculate sales tax for all items in column F, and then copy it to the other rows.\n(Hint: You need to use the absolute cell reference $G$1 in your formula. Because each formula is using the same tax rate, we want that reference to remain constant when the formula is copied and filled to other cells in column F). \n3. Create the formula in G3 to calculate the net price by adding total price and sales tax for each item and copy it to the other rows. \n4. Finally, calculate the grand total that sums up all net prices in cell G9 so that student Ebsa will pay.\nTable 3.5 Using relative cell reference for calculating total price"

Can you mention some of propri -\netary and free presentation software? \nAs you learned in Grades 7 and 8, Presentation software is a category of application software that is specifically designed to allow you to display slides using a computer during a presentation. Some of very popular presentation software includes Microsoft PowerPoint, Google slides, and LibreOffice Impress. Presentations consist of a number of individual pages or slides.  Each slide may \ncontain text, graphics, sound, movies and other objects that can be freely arranged.In this section, you will learn about the presentation environment using Microsoft PowerPoint. \n3.4.1  Opening PowerPoint \nThe most common choices for opening a presentation after launching PowerPoint application are:\n New - allows you to open a blank presentation or you may choose from \noptions of Templates and Themes.\n Open - lets you navigate to an existing file to view and/or modify a \npresentation that has already been created.\n Recent - displays a list of your most recently created presentations and their file locations.\nTo open a PowerPoint 2016 presentation, click on the File tab in the upper left corner (See Figure 3.54).\nFigure 3.53 Click the file tab"

Remember to use color carefully to enhance your presentation, not to detract from it. You need to maintain good contrast between the background color and the text color. Consider using a light colored background and dark text or vice versa, but avoid busy backgrounds and primary colors. Use sans serif fonts like Arial, Calibri and Helvetica for titles and size them between 44 and 60 \npoints. Sub -headings should be between 32 to 40 points, and body text between \n18 to 32 points. Try not to use more than two fonts.\nPowerPoint has many preset designs and themes including complimentary \ncolors and fonts. To add a theme to a presentation, follow the steps below.\n1.

The use of multimedia to communicate ideas begins with newspapers, which is the \nfirst mass communication medium, using text, graphics and images. Following \nthis, radio  and television become major media for audio and video broadcasting \nrespectively. Therefore, multimedia is like a vehicle which can help you transfer information from a source area to its destination. \nImage processing is a method to perform some operations on an image in \norder to get an enhanced image or extract some useful information from it. You can use different application software such as commercial adobe Photoshop and free Gimp to process images.\nIn this unit, we will discuss the basics of image processing such as image \ncapturing, cropping, resizing, correcting and sharpening. We will end the unit with a practical section introducing adobe Photoshop facilities for basic image processing such as cropping, resizing, correction and sharpening.At the end of this unit, learners will be able to:\n Describe image processing \n Edit images captured from different sources such as digital camera.\n Use image software to create, import and save image files.\n Use image software to resize, cut and edit images.\nUNIT \nIMAGE PROCESSING AND MULTIMEDIA\nUNIT OUTCOMES4"

A pixel is the smallest \nelement of an image.\n4.1.2  Digital Image Processing\nImage processing is  a computational technique for analyzing, enhancing, \ncompressing, reconstructing and generally performing some operations on an image. Digital image processing techniques help us in manipulation of the digital images through the use of computers to enhance the quality of the image and improve pictorial information for human perception, i.e. enhancing the quality of the image so that the image will have a better look.\nDigital image processing starts with importing, in which an image is captured \nthrough scanner or digital camera; analysis and manipulation of the image is accomplished using various specialized software application and output (e.g. printer or monitor).\nFigure 4.2 Digital image processing\nKEY CONCEPTS\n /u270D_1F3FFImage is a representation of something.\n /u270D_1F3FFDigital image is an image which is stored in a computer.\n /u270D_1F3FFDigital image processing is a process of enhancing image and extracting use -\nful information from it.Activity 4.1\nCapture images from different sources to highlight the impact of environmental damage on Ethiopian society.

Before producing multimedia product, whether it is animation, film, movie or book, we should use a planning strategy such as a storyboard, which clearly expresses how the story will flow in multimedia product. \nStoryboard is a graphic layout that sequences illustrations and images with the \npurpose of telling a story visually. Film makers and video creators use storyboards to transfer ideas from their mind to the screen. Creating an effective storyboard requires skill, but you can gain some pro tips from storyboard examples.\nTo create a storyboard, you can use different software or rough sketch using \na paper and pencil. \nDeveloping Storyboard \nStoryboarding refers to the process of creating a sequence of screens to provide an overview of the project, demonstrate the arrangement and functionality of the program elements. It helps us to delineate the program’s navigation scheme. Multimedia storyboard can include elements of video, sketch, text, audio, photos and even physical prototypes used for the purpose of pre-visualization.  It is a \nvisual representation of how a story will play out, scene by scene. See sample \nanimated storyboard for children in Figure 4.3."

This software allows you to edit and crop out unwanted “strange” images like the image with red-eye effect and the image in which one person’s head is put on the other’s body. Image processing software can be commercial and free. Some of the useful image processing application software kinds are Photoshop, Ms-paint, Gimp, Paint 3D, Photo styler, Photo editor and photo explosion. \nPhotoshop\n is a general-purpose application designed to work on any raster-\nbased (made up of dots or pixels) image and perform any number of included manipulations. It is one of the most popular image processing software packages available today. The software provides many image editing features for raster (pixel-based) images as well as vector graphics. Photoshop is used by photographers, graphic designers, video game artists, advertising and meme \ndesigners. Adobe Photoshop  enables you to create website layouts and attractive \ngraphic designs.

The cursor will change to an eye-dropper.\n7. Paint over the “hot spot”, the light area will gradually darken (See Figure 4.23).\nPractical Exercise 4.3\nAdjusting Flash Effect on an Image \n1. Select the images that has flash problem (underexposed and dark, red eye, hot spot) among the images you captured during Activity 4.1 above or deliberately capture image with or without flash and use any image processing software available to you to correct the flash problem in your image.\n2.

Color Adjustment Using Level and curves \nLevels \nEvery image has a mix of shadows, highlights  and midtones. Shadows are \nthe darkest parts of the image whereas highlights are the brightest parts, and \nmidtones are everything in between. When you adjust levels, you are adjusting these different tones. While you could use the brightness and contrast tools for a similar type of adjustment, they are much less powerful than levels.\nThere are many reasons to use levels adjustment. For instance, if you have a \nparticularly dark or underexposed image, you might want to make the midtones and highlights brighter while keeping the shadows relatively dark. You can see examples of this in the images below.We use the following steps to adjust colors using levels.\n1. Open a digital photo you want to correct to the Photoshop (See Figure 4.25).\n2. In the Layers panel, add a Levels adjustment layer by clicking adjustment \nlayer \n  in Adobe Photoshop\nYou can do this using the Levels submenu under the Color menu in Gimp."

Because you can continue to tweak adjustment layers as you work, it is easy to try out different effects and get the image to look exactly the way you want.\n3. Locate the graph in the middle of the Properties panel. This is called a histogram, and it shows information about shadows, highlights and midtones of the image. In this example, you can see that there is a big gap on the right side with no information, which means the image is underexposed. We can use a levels adjustment to fix this.\n4. Notice the Input Levels sliders just below the histogram. These are the controls you will use to adjust the levels."

In this example, we will move the slider to the left to make the image brighter.\n8. Optional: Try turning the adjustment layer off and compare the new levels adjustments with the original image.

Save both original and corrected image in a folder called Image Processing Practice under Documents folder.\n4.3.7  Image Sharpening\nSometimes an image may not be as clear as you would like it to be. Sharpening can help you make it look crisp and clear by enhancing the edges of objects in the image - increasing the contrast of the edges within your photo, which brings more definition to the details in your photo. However, adding too much sharpness can actually make an image look worse, or it can lead to a loss in image detail. To sharpen image in Adobe Photoshop, we can use either of the following options. \n Unsharp Mask\n Smart Sharpen  \n High Pass\nThe Unsharp mask filter is a common way to sharpen images in Photoshop. The \nname ‘Unsharp’ is derives from the fact that the technique uses a negative blurry image, which creates a mask for the original photo. This mask is subtracted from the original to detect the presence of edges. After all this, contrast is selectively increased along those edges using this mask. The final result is a sharper image. When you use this tool, you will be able to control several settings like amount, radius and threshold.Amount: The amount determines how much sharpness will be applied. The \namount you will need depends on several factors including the overall image size, so it is good to experiment with this setting.Radius : The radius controls the size of the details that will be sharpened, so it is \ngenerally best to use a very low value for this setting. We recommend a radius"

Increasing the \nthreshold can help you reduce this by telling the unsharp mask to ignore certain parts of the image. However, this can also mean that different parts of the image are not sharpened consistently. This is why we recommend keeping this setting at 0 most of the times unless the sharpening is creating a lot of extra noise.\nFigure 4.34 Correct sharpening\na.

Multimedia comes from two words, multi, which means multiple, and media, which is a way of conveying message. Hence, multimedia means multiple way of representing or conveying information. Multimedia can contain text, image, still images (videos) and etc. Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image in order to get an enhanced image or extract some useful information from it. The unit discussed basic operations on an image such as image capturing, cropping, resizing, correction and sharpening with Adobe Photoshop software. The basic concepts of this unit are listed below. \n One of the components of multimedia that is used to convey information is image, which represents something or someone visually. \n Every information stored in a computer is processed in 0s and 1s format. Therefore, an image is stored in a computer as 0’s and 1’s called digits.\n A pixel is a single dot on the screen in digital image, and it is picture element that collectively makes up a picture as a whole.\n Story boarding is a multimedia production planning strategy, which is used to tell one multimedia sequence of story from the beginning to end diagrammatically. \n Adobe Photoshop is one of the popular tools that are used to process a digital image. \n To crop unnecessary part of an image using Adobe Photoshop, you can use crop tool, marque tool or you can specify the width and height specifically.\n There is always no perfect camera shooting that produces perfect image, so we need to correct the color and the tone of an image."

Security has diverse definitions, which \nvary significantly depending on what is to keep secured. In general, security is the \nquality or state of being secure. It can be a freedom from danger (which is related to safety) or a freedom from fear or anxiety. Security also means protection and \nmeasures taken to guard against sabotage, crime, attack or escape. This, the latter, definition is a more proper one from institutional and business perspectives. Do you know that Ethiopia has a federal institution called Information Network Security Agency (INSA)? INSA was established for protecting the country’s national interest by building a capability to make information and information infrastructures in the country safeguarded. Thus, INSA is a national security agency with a mission on cyber security, which we shall cover this unit. \nThe focus of this unit is on computer security. Computer security is the protection \nof computer systems and information from harm, theft and unauthorized use. What is an unauthorized use? For example, you can use this textbook when you are learning in a classroom or when you study at school or at home. Can you use it during examination? Of course, not! Thus, we may say that it is illegal or you are unauthorized to access and use textbook during examinations.  Computer security is also the process of preventing and detecting unauthorized use of your computer system. There are various types of computer security, which is widely used to protect personal and organizational valuable information. Depending on what to secure, we can identify the following types of computer security (See Figure 5.1).\nFigure 5.1 Types of computer security"

Here, you will \nlearn about basic attributes that a computer security system should possess. The concept you learn here helps you, for example, to compare two computer security systems or specify the requirements to establish a particular computer security system. \nComputer security is mainly concerned with three main areas. These are \nconfidentiality , integrity and availability , which are abbreviated as CIA. Sometimes \nCIA is also called as the security requirements triad. Let us see the three components of CIA in detail. \n Confidentiality  is ensuring that information is available only to the \nintended audience. This often means that only authorized users and processes should be able to access or modify data. In other words, this involves protecting the information from a third party having unauthorized access. A concept related to this is privacy, which focuses \non protecting personal data.\n Integrity means that data can be trusted. It should be maintained in a \ncorrect state, kept so that it may not be wrongly changed and should be correct, authentic and reliable.\n Availability  is ensuring that the information is available to authorized \nusers whenever they require it. This means keeping systems, networks and devices up and running.\nFigure 5.2 shows the confidentiality, integrity and availability as a computer \nsecurity triangle.

The following two \nsections (5.2.1 and 5.2.2) present natural and artificial threats for computer security. \n5.3.1  Natural Threats in Computer Security\nThere are many computer security threats happening due to natural causes. \nNatural hazards such as earthquakes , flooding or lightning storms can lead to \nfires, extreme temperatures  and even electric shocks to your computer, causing \npotential physical damage and loss of data. These are discussed one by one below.             \nFire \nFire can be devastating to your computer. Beyond direct damage from flames, the heat generated can melt sensitive components within the computer. Smoke can damage the CPU fan which can also cause over-heating. In case of a fire, always get yourself to a safe place before trying to rescue your computer. \nExtreme temperature \nGenerally, computers are designed to function within a moderate temperature range. Excessive heat or cold can cause important components to malfunction or break. In cases of drastic temperature changes, it is best to allow the computer to return to room temperature before using it.\nLightning strikes \nLightning strikes are a huge threat to your computer, even if they never actually touche your hardware. Sometimes, a lightning strike will create an electric surge (or spike) that amplifies the voltage to your computer through the power supply. This sudden surge of electricity can destroy crucial components of your comput -\ner including your motherboard. \nActivity 5.3\n1. Discuss with your classmate about the fire burn and property damages of any one of the classed encountered the burning, and what could be done with fire-related emergencies in computer laboratories and data centres."

Computer security threats change their nature and methods with a change in the technology. With the recent development on Internet-based services, the majority of manmade security threats come through the Internet as a platform, i.e. they come through network connectivity. Hence, the term cyber security is used interchangeably with computer security. The attack on computer security is also widely referred as cyber-attack. The prefix cyber, both in cyber-security and cyber-attack and as \nwell cyberspace refers to computers and computer networks.  Cyber-attacks are classified in different ways. You can consider the following as the main types of cyber-attacks.\n1. Denial of service (DoS)\n2. Malware attack\n3. Man in the middle\n4. Phishing\n5. Eavesdropping\n6. SQL injection\n7. Password attack\n8. Social engineering\nTable 5.1 below describes different types of computer security attacks. Malware \nattacks such as Trojan horses, worms and virus were in existence since the era of file sharing through portable file sharing. Denial of services (DoS), phishing, SQL injections and password attacks are popularized with the dominance of the Internet as a service platform. Malware stands for malicious software. Cyber-attacks can also combine psychological and technological attacks particularly in the case of man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping and social engineering attacks."

This means the regular network- based services cannot be provided on timely manner. DoS attacks on bank IT infrastructure, for example, could stop the bank services such as ATM and CBE Birr services. Such attacks disappoint customers and the service providers, such as the banks, may encounter reputation damage as a result.\nMalware AttackTrojan horse: A code that takes over the system to steal and damage everything on the system. Trojan horse is the type of malware that downloads onto a computer being disguised or masked as a legitimate program.\nVirus: A malicious code that gets into the computer program by \nreplicating to change its functioning. Melisa virus is a common one that spreads itself in the system without acknowledging the user. Some people also refer to it as rootkit.\nKey logger: They work by recording the movement on the \nkeyboards and mostly steal passwords and accounts’ details.\nWorms: An independent program that infects the computer \nsystem through network devices\nAdware: Advertising software to spread malware. Adware \n(or advertising software) are various pop-up advertisements that show up on your computer or mobile device. Adware has the potential to become malicious and harm your device by slowing it down, hijacking your browser and installing viruses and/or spyware.\nBotnets:  The word botnet is formed from the words robot \nand network.

Open Wi-Fi networks are the most common place where this kind of attack takes place.\nPhishingPhishing attacks are the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source. It is usually performed through email. The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information or to install malware on the victim’s machine. Phishing is a common type of cyber-attack that everyone should learn about in order to protect him/herself.\nEavesdroppingAn eavesdropping attack occurs when a hacker intercepts, deletes or modifies data that is transmitted between two devices. Eavesdropping is also known as sniffing or snooping. It relies on unsecured network communications to access data in transit. It typically occurs when a user connects to a network in which traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague. The data is transmitted across an open network, which gives an attacker the opportunity to exploit vulnerability and intercept it via various methods. Eavesdropping attacks can often be difficult to spot.

The popular impacts of computer security threats are the following. \n1. Destruction or loss of information :  such as destruction of system components \nor loss of data due to failure of a hard disk. \n2. Corruption of information: like unauthorized alteration of files stored such as adding or reducing student marks stored in a school database or in a computer used by your homeroom teacher. Posting documents that the school considers as illegal or unacceptable onto your or the school’s social media channels (e.g. Telegram or Facebook) is example of corruption of information.  \n3. Theft of services: is an unauthorized use of computer or network services. Consider, for example, that you have access privilege to the school Internet service for educational purposes. If you use this privilege for unrelated purposes such as for online marketing (for promoting goods), then, it becomes a theft of services.   \n4. Illegal usage: uses the normal function of the system to achieve the attacker’s behavior for other purpose.

All living organisms encounter numerous kinds of problems and attempt to solve them instinctively. We, humankinds, go many steps ahead and try to solve problems applying tools and methods. Do you remember the recent problem that you run into and how did you solve it? You might have done it by asking someone else or by applying a technique that you had known beforehand. You might also use tools such as a calculator for mathematical problems or machineries of some sorts.  This can be what a problem solving is. \nThis unit focuses on enabling you develop problem solving skills with a focus on \ncomputational problems. You can consider a computational problem as a problem that is solvable applying computers. You will learn the common steps of problem solving and the top-down and bottom-up approaches of solving computational problems. This will enable you to develop your skills in computational thinking.  \nComputational thinking involves skills in formulating and solving problems by breaking them down into simple steps as well as synthesizing simple steps into bigger solutions. You will also be familiar with representation of a solution or \nsteps in solving a given problem using graphic tool called flowchart, and visualize how a computer follows them to perform the task associated.  At the end of this unit, learners will be able to:\n Describe problem solving techniques.\n Compare and contrast steps of problem solving techniques.\n Use top-down and bottom-up problem solving techniques.\n Evaluate simple algorithms represented in flowcharts and pseudocodes.  \nUNIT \nFUNDAMENTALS OF PROGRAMMING\nUNIT OUTCOMES6"

A computational problem is a problem that can be solved systematically (step-by-step) with a computer. These problems usually have a well-defined inputs, constraints and conditions that the output must satisfy. You will learn about these requirements for a computational problem later in sections 6.2 and 6.3. Here are some types of computational problems:\n A decision problem is one where the answer is Yes  or No. For instance, \n“given an Integer n, is n even?” is a decision problem. \n A search problem is the one where the solution consists of one or more \nvalues that satisfy a given condition. For instance, we may want to compute a path from one geographical location to another on a map. Another instance, we may want to get a name from a list of names in a spreadsheet column.\n A counting problem is the one where the answer is a number of solutions to \na search problem. For instance, counting the number of female students from Grade 9 students’ list. \n An optimization problem  is the one where the solution is the “best” possible \nsolution, where the “best” can be defined in a different way. For instance, we may want to compute the fastest route from one location to another. Note that you learned about router in unit 2, which is an intermediary device to find the best route to send message or packet.  This device, thus, handles optimization problem in network traffic management.  \n A computational problem is the problem that can be solved step-by-\nstep with a computer.

In short, an algorithm is a precise sequence of instructions for solving a problem. Algorithms are a way of specifying a multistep task, and are especially useful when we wish to explain to another person or machine how to carry out steps. For example, what steps do you follow to calculate the average of 10 numbers? The following sequence of activities should be performed to get the average in the order they are presented. \nStep 1. If you do not know the numbers, get the 10 numbers.Step 2. Get SUM by adding the 10 numbers. Step 3. Get AVERAGE by dividing SUM by 10.Step 4. Tell or report AVERAGE as a result.  \nAlgorithm:  is a precise sequence of instructions for solving a problem \nrepresented in human-understandable format.  \nAn algorithm written needs to be transformed into a computer program to \nbe executed by a computer or any other digital devices. This transformation is required because computers do not understand instructions written in English, Amharic, Afan Oromo or other languages that we humans speak.

Scratch helps you to code simple stories, animations and games. It is freely downloadable from https://scratch.mit.\nedu/. In this unit, you will use it to build your skills in the use of selection and repetitions with visual coding. Note that it is not a flowcharting tool, instead it is a programming language specifically designed for children. \nFigure 6.6 shows the Scratch’s first window. At the top right, you get a stage \nwith a sprite, a cat by default. The sprites are the actors or main characters of the \nproject. Sprites are programmed to do something in scratch.

The scrip tells the actors what to say or do. In \nversion 3 of scratch, the programming pallet is at the left side of the windows and labeled as code.

For example, how do you determine whether a given number is even or odd? You divide the number by two and if the remained is not 0, then you say the number is odd. Which flowchart symbol is more appropriate – decision (or if) or looping such as while? The answer is the if structure. See the \nflowgorithm flowchart shown in Figure 6.8 (A). As you can see in the flowchart, a variable number is declared and an integer is accepted into it with an input \nsymbol. There is a prompt “Enter an integer: “ as output before the input to alert the person to key in the number. The next symbol is the diamond/decision with a condition number % 2 = 0 . Flowgorithm uses % as a special operator called modulo-\ndivide, which gives the remainder of an integer division. For example, 14%3 is 2, which is the remainder. This operator (%) is the same as mode in Excel. Check \n=Mode(14, 3) in an Excel cell. Then the condition checks whether the remainder is equal to 0 or not. The flow to output ” number is even”   goes only if the remainder \nequals to 0; otherwise, the flow moves towards the “number is odd” direction. \nFigure 6.8 (B) represents a flowgorithm flowchart that displays all positive \nintegers less than 10. The numbers are 2, 4, 6 and 8. To display these step-by-step, the flowchart begins with declaring num as a variable to help the computer to \nstore different even integers. Then 2 is assigned to num. Assign  means making a \nvariable to hold a value, which is 2 at the beginning. There is a while loop next to \nthe output. The while loop checks whether num is less than 10, and if this is true, \nit goes inside the loop. The loop outputs or prints the num value and adds 2 to the existing value of num. It goes back to the condition checking and the cycle continues until the condition  num < 10 becomes FALSE, in which cases the flow goes out of the while loop to finish the task."

It is important that we develop and test algorithm before developing program for a given problem. With an increasing complexity of a problem to solve, there is a need to be systematic and apply appropriate problem solving strategy. Top-down and bottom-up programming refer to two different strategies for developing a computer program for complex problems.  \n6.4.1  Top-Down Approaches \nTop-down approach starts by implementing the most general modules and works toward implementing those that provide specific functionality. The idea behind top-down approach is that a bigger problem is difficult to manage in its entirety. Thus, the problem is decomposed or divided into smaller and manageable sub-problems. These sub-problems are then solved individually and then, later, integrated together to get the complete solution for the bigger problem. The solution developed for a smaller problem is called a module. This process of dividing the problem into smaller problem is known as modularization. \nRefer back to question 1 of Practical Exercise 6.4 above. You were asked to \ndraw a flowchart to calculate wages of 10 laborers by improving the flowchart that calculates net-pay for a single laborer for Practical Exercise 6.2.  In question 1 of Practical Exercise 6.4, you were expected to integrate a repetition (loop) to calculate 10 wages by repeating a set of instructions to complete a single wage for 10 times. This can be divided into two modules. The first module calculates a wage for one laborer. The second module uses the service of the first module to compute 10 wages. See the flowchart symbol for subroutine in section 6.3 above \nand the CALL symbol of flowgorithm. \nFigure 6.9 shows the flowchart for wage calculation of 10 laborers. As you \ncan see in Figure 6.9, there are two modules. The first is CalculateWage, which \ncalculate net pays with specification given in question 6 of Practical Exercise 6.2."

What will you do if you are given a duty to write a program to which the existing modules are relevant? \nThis method of solving a problem works exactly opposite of how the top-down approach works. Top-down programming starts by implementing the most general modules and works toward implementing those that provide specific functionality. In bottom-up approach, the most fundamental units, modules and sub-modules are designed and solved individually; these units are then integrated together to get a more concrete base to problem solving.\nFor example, how can you do if you want to write a program to calculate \narea and perimeter of different polygons (circle, triangle, rectangle, cube, parallelogram, etc.) applying bottom-up approach. If you have already modules with required functionalities (that is area and perimeter calculation) for each types of polygon, you can bring together those individual components and integrate them. Otherwise, you develop each module first and then incrementally build them up (or synthesize) as a bigger program.      \nOverall, most programs are developed using a combination of top-down and \nbottom-up strategies. Both strategies are based on incremental development – the process of building your program piece by piece. Both strategies employ unit testing – testing each individual piece before moving on to the next.\nKEY CONCEPTS\n /u270D_1F3FF To develop algorithm, we may use bottom-up approach or top-down \napproach.\n /u270D_1F3FFTop-down approach divides the large problem into small chunks called modules and concurs each module individually whereas bottom-up approache starts from individual chunk or module to build up the entire problem solution."

You also need a script, which are actions that a sprite takes during the play. For example, the bowl makes horizontal move to collect the falling apples. You also need stages that change as needed in the game. Read about one of the games and develop a scratch script for the game.
