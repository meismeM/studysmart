You, \ntherefore, need to bring your textbook to class and practice exercises regularly.\nEnjoy it!\nIntroduction on Stu dents’ Textbook.\nDear students, this textbook has 7 units namely: Relations and Functions, Polynomial \nfunctions, Exponential and Logarithmic Functions, Trigonometric functions, Circles, \nSolid Figures and Coordinate Geometry respectively. Each of the units is composed of \nintroduction, objectives, lessons, key terms, summary, and review exercises. Each unit \nis basically unitized, or lesson based, and each lesson has four components: Activity, \nDefinition, Examples, and exercises (ADEE). \nThe most important part in this process is to practice problems by yourself based on \nwhat your teacher shows and explains. Your teacher will also give you feedback , \nassistance, and facilitate further learning. In such a way, you will be able to not only \nacqui renew knowledge and skills but also develop them further. \nActivity\nThis part of the lesson demands you to revise what you have learnt or activate your background knowledge on the topic.

Now, we need to find the \nmissing term in the pattern.\nHere, we can use the addition process to figure out the missing terms in the patterns.\nIn the pattern, the rule used is “Add 2 to the previous term to get the next terms ”.\nFirst missing term: The previous term is 10. Therefore, 10+2 = 12.\nSecond missing term: The previous term is 14.

Similar to the arithmetic pattern, if two or more \nnumbers in the sequence are provided, we can easily find the unknown terms in the \npattern using multiplication and division operation.\nFor example, consider the pattern 2, 4, 8, __, 32, __.\nIt is a geometric pattern, as each term in the sequence can be obtained by multiplying \n2 with the previous term . 8 is the third term in the sequence, which is obtained by \nmultiplying 2 with the previous term 4.\nFirst missing term: The previous term is 8. Multiply 8 by 2, we get 16.\nSecond missing term: The previous term is 32.

It has a \nsingle unit of length for both axes and an orientation for each axis. The point where \nthe axes meet is taken as the origin for both and used as a turning point for each axis \ninto a number line. For any point (P), a line \ndrawn through 𝑃perpendicular to each axis \nand the position where it meets the axis is \ninterpreted as a number. The two numbers in \nthat chosen order are the Cartesian coordinate \nof P.The first and second coordinates are \ncalled the abscissa and the ordinate of P, \nrespectively and the point where the axes meet \nis called the origin of the coordinate system. The coordinates are usually written as two \nnumbers in parentheses in that order separated by a comma, as in (3,2). Thus the origin \nhas coordinates (0,0), and the points on the positiv e half-axes which is one unit away \nfrom the origin and have coordinates (1,0)and(0,1).\nIn mathematics, physics, and engineering, the first axis is usually defined or depicted \nas horizontal and oriented to the right. The second axis is vertical and oriented \nupwards. The origin is often labeled O, and the two coordinates are often denoted by \n  \n3 2𝑃(3,2)\nAbscissa Ordinate𝑃(3,2)OriginFigure 1.2 Linear patterns"

Find a polynomial function 𝑓(𝑥)of degree two whose zeros are 1, −2 and\n     satisfying the condition 𝑓(3)=30.\nSolution:\na.By the factor theorem 𝑥+1is a factor of 𝑓(𝑥). To find the other factor, you can \nuse long division giving 𝑓(𝑥)=(𝑥+1)(𝑥2−2𝑥−3) . Further factoring the \nquadratic factor gives (𝑥+1)(𝑥+1)(𝑥−3)= (𝑥+1)2(𝑥−3) . Therefore, -1 is \na zero of multiplicity 2 of 𝑓(𝑥).\nb.Let𝑓(x)=𝑘(𝑥−1)(𝑥+2)forsomenumber 𝑘. Clearly 1and −2are zeros of\n𝑓(𝑥). Tofind 𝑘, since 𝑓(3)=𝑘(3−1)(3+2)=𝑘(2)(5)=10𝑘=30, implies\n𝑘= 3. Therefore ,the polynomial function of degree two is            \n     𝑓(𝑥)= 3(𝑥−1)(𝑥+2)= 3𝑥2+3𝑥−6\n1.Given that 𝑥 = 1is a zero of   𝑓(𝑥)=𝑥3−4𝑥2+5𝑥−2, find the other zeros \nand their multiplicity.\n2.For each of the following polynomials, list the zeros and state the multiplicity   \nofeach zero.\n        a.  𝑘 (𝑡)= (𝑡+2\n3)3𝑡10.\n        b.  𝑔 (𝑥)= 5( 𝑥+ξ2)2(𝑥+2)3(1+3 𝑥).  \n        c.  ℎ (𝑡)= 2𝑡3+5𝑡2+4𝑡+1.\n      3.   a.

The values of 𝑓(𝑥)become large positive and the graphs go upward both far \nto the right and far to the left as the values of 𝑥become large in absolute value.\nIn figure 2.5c and figure 2.5d, the leading coefficient of 𝑓(𝑥)is negative and the degree \nis even. The values of 𝑓(𝑥)become large negative and the graphs go downward both \nfar to the right and far to the left as the values 𝑥become large in absolute value.\nFrom figure 2.5b, it is seen that the maximum number of intersections that the graph \nof a fourth-degree polynomial makes with the x-axis is 4 and the maximum number of \nturning points is 3.\nAs shown in figure 2.5a, the graph of a polynomial function of degree 4 may not \nintersect the x-axis. \nBy applying the rational root test and the factor theorem, there is a possibility of finding the x-intercepts of a function. There is also a possibility of locating the real zeros using\nthe location theorem. \nWith quadratic polynomials, we were able to algebraically find the maximum or \nminimum value of the function by finding the vertex (turning point). But for general \npolynomials, finding the turning points like A, B and C in figure 2.5d, is not possible \nwithout more advanced techniques from calculus (derivative of a function).    \nObservation\nThe properties of the first-degree and the third-degree polynomial are also applicable \nfor polynomial functions of odd degree. The properties of the second-degree and the\nfourth-degree polynomial are also applicable for polynomial functions of even degree"

It provides a connection between \nalgebra and geometry through graphs of lines and curves. This enables geometric \nprobl emsto be solved algebraically and provides geometric insights into algebra.\nThe number plane (Cartesian plane) is divided into four quadrants by two \nperpendicular axes called the 𝑥-axis (horizontal line) and the 𝑦-axis (vertical line). \nThese axes intersect at a point called the origin. The position of any point in the plane \ncan be represented by an ordered pair of numbers (𝑥,𝑦). These ordered pairs are called \nthe coordinates of the point. The origin is denoted \nby the ordered pair (0, 0).\nThe point with coordinates (2,3)  has been plotted \non the Cartesian coordinate plane asshown in \nfigure 7.1. Once the coordinates of two points are \nknown, the distance between the two points and \nmidpoint of the interval joining them can be found.\n                                                          \n                                                                                      Figure 7.1"
