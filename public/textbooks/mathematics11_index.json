To calculate the cost of a 80 kilometers trip, substitute 80 for x in the equation:\n\ny =15x+300\nThus, y(80) =(15x80)+300 =1500.\n\nTherefore, the cost of 80 kilometers trip is 1500 Birr.\n\nA man that buys and sells newspapers buys newspapers for price of Birr 6 per\nnewspaper and sells newspapers at price of Birr 10 per newspaper. The unsold\nnewspapers at the end of the day can be sold at 4 Birr per newspaper to a wastepaper\ndealer. If the man bought 300 newspapers, sold 200 newspapers and another 50\n\nnewspapers to a wastepaper dealer, what is the profit of the man in that day?\n\nSolution\n\nThe overall profit to the man depends on the number of newspapers that he sells in\nrelation to the number of newspapers he bought at the beginning of the day.\nPurchase: 300 x 6 Birr = 1800 Birr\nSale: (200 x 10 Birr) + (50 x 4 Birr)=2000 Birr+200 Birr=2200 Birr.\nProfit: Sale —Purchase= 2200Birr —1800Birr = 400Birr .\nTherefore, the profit of the man on that particular day is 400 Birr.\n\nExample 4\n\nAssume that for a closed economy, E= C+ I+ G,where E is total expenditure,\n\nC is expenditure on consumption of goods, I is expenditure on investment on\ngoods and G is Government spending.\n\nFor equilibrium, we must have E = Y, where Y is the total income received.\n\nI"

A reflection A about a line L is a\ntransformation of the plane onto itself which carries point A of the plane into the\npoint A' of the plane such that L is the perpendicular bisector of AA’.\n\nThe line L is called the line of reflection or the axis of reflection\nA\n\nNX\n\nFigure 6.7\n\nNotation: The reflection of a point A about the line L, is denoted by M(A);\ni.e., A’ = M(A).\n\n—— Basic Properties of Reflection\n\n1. A reflection about a line L has the property that, for two points A and B in the\nplane, if A = B, then M(A) = M(B). Hence, reflection is a function mapping\nthe set of points in the plane into the set of points in the plane except\nreflection of points about the axis of reflection.\n\n2. Areflection about a line L maps distinct points to distinct points, 1.e., if\nAB, then M(A) + M(B). Equivalently, it has the property that, for points A\nand B in the plane, M(A) = M(B), then A = B. Thus, reflection is a\none-to-one mapping.\n\n3. For every point A' in the plane, there exists a point A such that M(A) = A’.\n\nIf the point A' is on L, then there exists A = A' such that M(A) = A’. Thus,\n\nreflection is an onto mapping.\n\n_4—_————"

Explain meaning and steps to calculate Percentiles for ungrouped data?\n\nPercentiles divide the data set into 100 equal groups. There are 99 percentiles,\nnamely, P1, P2, ... Poo.\n\nPercentiles are also used to compare an individual’s test score with the national\nnorm. For example, tests such as the National examination are taken by students in\ng grade. A student’s scores are compared with those of other students locally and\nnationally by using percentile ranks.\n\nPercentiles and percentages are two different concepts. Thus, the percentage is a\nmathematical quantity which is written out of a total of 100 whereas a percentile is\nthe percentage of values found under the specific values. Percentiles are mostly used\nfor the ranking system. For instance, if you get 72 correct answers out of a possible\n100. You obtain a percentage score of 72. There is no indication of your position\nwith respect to the rest of the class. You could have scored the highest, the lowest, or\nsomewhere in between. On the other hand, if a raw score of 72 corresponds to the\n\n64\" percentile, then you did better than 64% of the students in your class.\n\n—_—_ ——__"

This\nchanges when you work with grouped data, because when you work with grouped\ndata there are no numbers to count how many times each number is repeated. Instead\nthe data is organized in intervals and the way the mode is found changes.\n\nNow, before you find any mode(s) that might exist, check the class interval of all\nclasses should be equal (uniform class interval).\n\nYou can use the following steps to compute the mode of grouped or continuous\n\nfrequency distribution with equal class intervals:\n\nStep 1: Prepare the frequency distribution table in such a way that its first column\nconsists of the observations and the second column the respective frequency.\n\nStep 2: Determine the class of maximum frequency by inspection. This class is\ncalled the modal class.\n\nStep 3: To calculate mode, use the following formula:\n\nMode =% = By, + ( ua ji\nd14+ do\n\nWhere,\n\nB, = lower class limit of the modal class.\n\nd\\= the difference between the frequency of the modal class(fmo) and the\nfrequency of the preceding class (pre-modal class) = (fino) — fi\n\nd>= the difference between the frequency of the modal class and the\nfrequency of the subsequent class (next class) = (fino) — f2\n\ni= size of the class interval.\n\n—_—-_ @— __"

Consider that six students leave the class; re-enter one by one and take a seat.\n\nIn how many ways can you seat these students?\n2. Consider students observing car plate numbers. The first digit is from 26\nEnglish alphabet, the other five digits are a number from 0 to 9. Discuss in\n\nhow many different ways a car plate number is written.\n\nFrom Activity 8.1, in order to calculate probabilities, you have to know the number\nof elements of an event and the number of elements of the sample space. Thus, if the\nexperiment is leaving and re-entering of 6 students into the class, what is the total\nnumber of possible outcomes? If an event EF is defined by number of ways the\nstudents can seat, similarly if the experiment is car plate number, what is the total\nnumber of possible outcomes? If an event E is defined by \"6 English alphabet and 6-\ndigit number\", then how do you find n(E)? From this, you can observe that counting\nplays a very important role in finding probabilities of events.\n\nThus, when the number of possible outcomes is very large, it will be difficult to find\nthe number of possible outcomes by listing. One may use fundamental principle of\ncounting which helps us to find the number of ways of occurrence (selections) of\n\nevents in a given order such as the multiplication and the addition principle.\n\n8.2.1 Multiplication Principle\n\nConsider the following example before stating the multiplication principle.\n\nI"
