Joining secondary school is a new \nexperience and transition from primary school Mathematics education. In this stage, \nyou are going to get new knowledge and experiences which can help you learn and \nadvance your academic, personal, and social career in the field of Mathematics.  \nEnjoy it!  \nIntroduction on Students’ Textbo ok. \nDear students, this textbook has 9 units namely: Further on sets, the number system, \nSolving Equations, Solving Inequalities, Introduction to Trigonometry, Regular \nPolygons, Congruency and Similarity, Vectors in two Dimensions and Statistics and \nProbab ility respectively.  Each of the units is composed of introduction, objectives, \nlessons, key terms, summary , and review exercises. Each unit is basically unitized, and  \nlesson based. Structurally, each lesson has four components: Activity, Definition, \nExampl es, and Exercises (ADEE).  \nThe most important part in this process is to practice problems by yourself based on \nwhat your teacher shows and explains. Your teacher will also give you feedback, \nassistance and facilitate further learning. In such a way you wil l be able to not only \nacquire new knowledge and skills but also advance them further. Basically, the four \nsteps of each of the lessons are: Activity, Definition/Theorem/Note, Example and \nExercises .  \nActivity  \nThis part of the lesson demands you to revise wh at you have learnt or activate your \nbackground knowledge on the topic. The activity also introduces you what you are \ngoing to learn in new lesson topic.  \nDefinition/Theorem/Note  \nThis part presents and explains new concepts to you. However, every lesson may not \nbegin with definition, especially when the lesson is a continuation of the previous one."

In this part, you need to li sten to your teacher’s explanation carefully \nand participate  actively. Note that your teacher may not discuss all the examples in the \nclass. In this case, you need to attempt and internalize the examples by yourself.  \nExercise  \nUnder this part of the material, you will solve the exercise and questions individually, \nin pairs or groups to practice what you learnt in the examples. When you are doing the \nexercise in the classroom either in pairs or groups, you are expected to share your \nopinions with your friends, listen to oth ers’ ideas carefully and compare yours with \nothers. Note that you will have the opportunity of cross checking your answers to the \nquestions given in the class with the answers of your teacher.

So, there is an intention of changing the denominator \nas rational.  \nFor instance: 1\n√3 has an irrational denominator , √3. Here, our aim is changing the \nnumber 1\n√3  to an equivalent number with a rational denominator. What shall we do?  \nThe technique of transferring the radical expression from the denominator to the \nnumerator is called rationalizing the denominator  (changing the denominator into a \nrational number).  \nDo you recall the existence of multiplicative identity 1  for the set of real \nnumbers?  \nThe number that can be used as a multiplier to rationalize the denominator is called the \nrationalizing factor which is equivalent to 1.  \nFor example: If you have an irrational number  √𝑎 and if you need to rationalize  the \ndenominator of  1\n√𝑎, the rationalizin g factor will be √𝑎\n√𝑎=1. \n \nRationalize the denominator for each of the following.  \n  a.  2\n√3                      b.  √2\n√5              c.  1\n√23  (to change in to 2 as its denominator)    \nSolution:  \na.

For a system of linear equations in two variables, we can \ndetermine both the type of system and the solution by graphing the system of \nequat ions on the same set of axes.  \nTo solve systems of li nea r equations using gra phs, use the followin g steps:  \nStep 1.

Find the time taken to reach a height of \n200 𝑚 by first finding an expression for  𝑡>0.  \nSolution:     \nWe are asked two things.  First, we will solve the height equation for  𝑡, and then we \nwill find how long it takes for the object’s he ight above the ground to be 200 𝑚. \nSolve for  𝑡:  \n  ℎ=600 −16𝑡2  \n 𝑡2=600 −ℎ\n16  \n   𝑡=√600 −ℎ\n16=ξ600 −ℎ\n4  \nWe want time to be only positive since we are talking about a measurable quantity, \nso we will restrict our answers to just  𝑡=ξ600 −ℎ\n4 \nWe want to know at what time the height will be 200 𝑚. So we can substitute 200 \nfor ℎ. \n                𝑡=ξ600 −200\n4=ξ400\n4=20\n4=5 \nTherefore, it takes 5 seconds for the object to be at the height of  200 𝑚. \n \nSuppose a rocket projectile is launched from a tower into the air with an initial \nvelocity of 48 meters per second. Its height, h, in meter  above the ground is modeled \nby the equation  ℎ=−16𝑡2+𝑣0𝑡+64 where 𝑡>0 is the time  in second, since the \nprojectile was launched and v 0 is the initial velocity. How long was the projectile in \nthe air?  \nExample 1  \n  \nExample 2  \n  \n145"

Befor e \ngraphing the equations, decide whether the line or curve is part of the solution or not, \nthat is, whether it is solid or dashed.  \nIf the inequality symbol is ei ther ≤or ≥, then the points on the  boundary line are \nsolutions to the inequality and the line must be solid . If the symbol is ei ther <or >, \nthen the points on the boundary line are not solutions to the inequality and the line is \ndashed.  \nNext, decide which side of the boundary line must be shade d to show the part of the \ngraph that represents all  (𝑥,𝑦)  coordinate pairs that make the inequa lity true. To do \nthis, choose a point not on the boundary line. Substitute the 𝑥- and 𝑦-values of this \npoint int o the original inequalit ies. If the inequalit y is true for the test point, then \nshade the region on the side of the boundary line that contains the test point. If the \ninequality is  false for the test point, then shade the opposite regi on.

Vectors are quantities that are fully described by both a magnitude and a \ndirection.  \n3. A vector is represented geometrically by a directed line segment (a line segment \nwith direction) denoted by an arrow 𝐴𝐵⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ . In this case, the point 𝐴 is called the \ninitial  and the point 𝐵 is called the terminal . A vector also represented by using \nletters with an arrow bar over it such as 𝑢⃗ ,𝑣 ,𝑎  etc. \n4. The magnitude of a given vector 𝐴𝐵⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗  or 𝑢 ⃗⃗⃗   is the length of the line segment from \nits initial point 𝐴 to its terminal point. It is denoted by absolute value sign as \n|𝐴𝐵⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ |or |𝑢⃗ |. \n5. On a plane, the direction of a vector is given by the angle the vector makes with \na reference direction, often an angle with the horizontal or with the vertical.  \n6.
