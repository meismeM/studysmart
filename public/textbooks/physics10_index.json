Physical quantities that fall in the ﬁrst category are those\nthat can be completely speciﬁed by a number together with an appropri-\nate unit of measurement. For instance, it makes perfectly good sense to\nsay that the length of an object is 1.42 mor that the mass of an object is\n12.21 kg. You do not have to add anything to the description of length or\nmass. Similarly, the statement that the density of water is 1000 kg/m3is a\ncomplete description of density. Quantities that can be speciﬁed in this\nsimple and straightforward way are called scalar quantities. Thus, scalar\nquantities are physical quantities that can be completely speciﬁed by a\nsingle number together with an appropriate unit of measurement. Time,\ndistance, speed, length, volume, temperature, energy and power are other\nexamples of scalar quantities.\nExercise 1.2\nList examples of\nscalars and vec-tors other than\nthose discussed in\nthe textbook.On the other hand, quantities that fall in the second category are those\nwhich require both magnitude and direction for their complete description.\nA simple example is velocity. The statement that the velocity of a train is\n100 km/h does not make much sense unless you also tell the direction in\nwhich the train is moving. Force is another such quantity. You must specify\nnot only the magnitude of the force but also the direction in which the\nforce is applied. Such quantities are called vectors. A vector quantity has\nboth magnitude and direction. Displacement, acceleration, momentum,\nimpulse, weight and electric ﬁeld strength are other examples of vector\nquantities."

The word position describes\nyour location (where you are). However, saying that you are here is mean-\ningless, and you have to specify your position relative to a known reference\npoint. So, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient frame of\nreference. A frame of reference is an arbitrary set of axes from which the\nposition and motion of an object are described.\nTo visualize position for objects moving in a straight line, you can imagine\nthe object is on a number line. The object may be placed at any point on\nthe number line in the positive numbers or the negative numbers. It is\ncommon to choose the original position of the object to be on the zero\nmark as shown in Figure 2.1. In making the zero mark the reference point,\nyou have chosen a frame of reference. The exact position of an object is\nthe separation between the object and the reference point.\nPosition is thus the location of an object with reference to an origin. It can\nbe negative or positive. It has units of length: centimeter (cm), meter (m)\nor kilometer (km). For example, depending on that reference point you\nchoose, you can say that the new constructed school is 300 mfrom Kemal’s\nhouse (with Kemal’s house as the reference point or origin)."

When you say an\nobject has a certain velocity, you must state its velocity with respect to a\ngiven reference frame. In everyday life, when you measure the velocity of\nan object, the reference frame is taken to be the ground or the earth. For\nexample, if you are traveling in a train and the train, is moving at a speed\nof 100 km/h, then your speed according to another passenger sitting on\nthat train is zero. According to him, you are not moving. But if someone\nobserves you from outside the train, standing on the ground, according to\nhim, you are moving at 100 km/h as you are on the train and the train is\nmoving at 100 km/h. Hence, the motion observed by the observer depends\non the location (frame) of the observer. This type of motion is called rela-\ntive motion.\nKey Concept\n/lefthandRelative veloc-\nity is the velocity\nof an object withrespect to an-other object or\nobserver.The relative velocity of object A with respect to object B is the rate of\nchange of position of the object A with respect to the object B. If vAand\nvBbe the velocities of objects A and B with respect to the ground, then\n• The relative velocity of A with respect to B is vAB=vA−vB.\n• The relative velocity of B with respect to A is vBA=vB−vA.\nIn one-dimensional motion, objects move in a straight line. So there are\nonly two possible cases: objects are moving in the same direction or in\nopposite directions. Thus, while using the above expressions, the signs of\nvelocities needs to be the same (say, positive) for bodies that are moving in\nthe same direction. But if they are moving in opposite directions, one of the\nvelocities (say to the right) should be positive while the other one becomes\nnegative. Thus, if the two objects are moving in the same direction, the\nmagnitude of the relative velocity of one object with respect to anotheris equal to the difference in magnitude of two velocities. But if the two\nobjects are moving in opposite directions, the above expression becomes\n•vAB=vA−(−vB)=vA+vB\n•vBA=−vB−vA=−(vA+vB) if object A is moving to the right and\nobject B is moving to the left."

There are two types of electric charge: positive charge and\nnegative charge. Protons have a positive charge, and electrons have a\nnegative charge. If the same amounts of negative and positive charge are\nbrought together, they neutralize each other and there is no net charge.\nPositive and negative charges are present in neutral objects, but their num-\nbers are equal. However, if there is a little bit more of one type of charge\nthan the other, then the object is said to be electrically charged.\nExercise 4.1\nWhen do you\nsay that a body\nis charged posi-\ntively?\nKey Concept\n/lefthandIf an object\ngains electrons,it becomes nega-tively charged; ifit loses electrons,it becomes posi-\ntively charged.Unit of Charge\nThe SI unit of electric charge is Coulomb (C ). One coulomb (1 C) of charge\nis carried by 6 .25×1018electrons. An electron possesses a negative charge\nof 1 .6×10−19C. In electrostatics, you often work with charge in micro\nCoulombs (1 µC=1×10−6C) and nano coulombs (1nC =1×10−9C).\nConservation of Charge\nDuring electriﬁcation, electric charges are neither created nor destroyed,\nbut are transferred from one material to another. This is called the law\nof conservation of charge. There are some practical examples of chargetransfer from one material to another. For example, have you ever seen\nthe old comb and hair trick where your hair rises and sticks to the comb?\nThis arises because of the simple conservation of charge, i.e., the transfer\nof charge either from the comb to the hair or vice versa.

Whenelectric chargesare transferred\nvery quickly, the\nprocess is calledan electrical dis-charge.

A charged body can be made to lose its chargesby touching it with a conductor. When a body is discharged, it becomes\nneutral.\nLightning\nLightning is a very large electrical discharge caused by induction. In a\nthunderstorm, a charged area, usually negative, builds up at the base of a\ncloud (Figure 4.5(a)). The negative charge at the base of the cloud creates\na temporary positively charged area on the ground through the induc-\ntion process (Figure 4.5(b)). When enough charge has built up, a path of\ncharged particles is formed (Figure 4.5(c)). The cloud then discharges its"

For lightning to happen, charges in the clouds\nmust build up to the point where the air cannot keep them separated from\nthe ground. Then, the air stops being an insulator and becomes a fair\nconductor, resulting in a lightning strike.Activity 4.4\nLightning are a\ncommon expe-rience duringrainy season.

The \"how\" of these electronic\ndevices working is answered by electrical circuits.\nExercise 4.27\nDid you remem-\nber any electricalprojects that youhave undertaken?Is there any tips\nthat you can share\nus from your\nexperience?As you already discussed in the previous sections, electrical circuits allow\ncurrent to ﬂow through our electronic devices to produce light, sound,\nand a variety of other effects. Of course, that is an easy statement to make\nbut one that is much harder to explain or demonstrate. That is where\nclassroom projects and lessons come in.\nThus, the best way to learn about circuits is through hands-on projects in\nwhich circuits are built and used. In this section, you will try to perform\nsome simple electrical projects using the concepts that you have learnt\nearlier.\nProject 4.1: A series lamp circuit\nAs you discussed earlier, in a series connection, components are connected\nend to end, so that current ﬂows ﬁrst through one lamp and then through\nthe other. The lamps are strung together, end to end.\nOne drawback of series connections is that if one component fails in a\nway that results in an open circuit, the entire circuit is broken and none\nof the components will work. So, if either one of the lamps in the series\ncircuit burns out, neither lamp will work. That is because current must\nﬂow through both lamps for the circuit to be complete.\nIn this project, you will build a simple circuit that connects two lampsin series, like the one shown in Figure 4.29. The lamps are powered by a\npair of AA batteries. Then, you will use your multimeter to measure the\nvoltages at various points in the circuit.\nEquipment and materials:\n• A small head screw driver"

The\nuse of magnets was discovered by the ancient Greeks during the period\nof Greek civilization. They found stones that were able to attract iron and\nnickel like other substances.

This is something like a magnet.\nFigure 5.1 Magnets of different\nshapes.A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic ﬁeld that is re-\nsponsible for a force that pulls or attracts other materials. Magnets attract\nobjects made of iron or steel, such as nails and paper clips. Magnets can\nalso attract or repel other magnets.\nMagnets can be made in various shapes and create their own persistent\nmagnetic ﬁeld. The magnets that are commonly available in different\nshapes are those indicated in Figure 5.1. These magnets of different shapes\nare used in various appliances used at home, like a tape recorder, radio,motor, door-bell, head phones, etc. They are used in these appliancesto either hold or separate, control, elevate (lift) substances, by changingelectrical energy into mechanical energy (motors, loudspeakers) or me-\nchanical into electrical energy (generators and microphones).\nTypes of Magnets\nThere are three categories of magnets. These are:\n1.Permanent Magnets: are made up of magnetic material (such as\nsteel) that is magnetized and has its own magnetic ﬁeld. They are\nknown as permanent magnets because they do not lose their mag-\nnetic property once they are magnetized. However, the strength"

It can do this because a compass consists of a small metal needle\nthat is magnetized itself and that is free to turn in any direction. Therefore,\nin the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the needle is able to line up in the same\ndirection as the ﬁeld.\nFigure 5.5 Compass.Compasses are mainly used in navigation to ﬁnd directions on the Earth.\nThis works because the Earth itself has a magnetic ﬁeld which is similar to\nthat of a bar magnets, as discussed above. The compass needle aligns with\nthe magnetic ﬁeld direction and points North (or South). Once you know\nwhere the North is, you can ﬁgure out any other direction. A picture of a\ncompass is shown in Figure 5.5.\nThe Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld also causes a compass needle to rotate. The\nNorth pole of the compass needle points toward the Earth’s magnetic pole,\nwhich is in the North. This magnetic pole is actually the magnetic South\npole. Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is like that of a bar magnet with the magnet’s\nSouth pole near Earth’s North pole.\nSome animals can detect magnetic ﬁelds, which helps them orient them-\nselves and ﬁnd directions.

Waves, such as water waves and sound waves, transfer energy by\nmaking particles of matter move. The energy is passed along from particle\nto particle as they collide with their neighbors.\nDepending on their medium of propagation, waves are categorized into\nmechanical waves and EM waves.\n•Mechanical waves are the types of waves that use matter to transfer\nenergy. They cannot travel in almost empty space between the Earth\nand the Sun.\n•An EM wave is a wave that can travel through empty space or through\nmatter. They are produced by charged particles, such as electrons,\nthat move back and forth or vibrate. It is thus made of electric and\nmagnetic ﬁelds as shown in Figure 6.1. Both parts are called ﬁelds\nand vibrate at right angles to the wave motion. Thus, EM waves are\ntransverse waves as you learnt in grade 9. In transverse waves, the di-\nrection of oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of propagation\nof waves while in a longitudinal wave, the direction of oscillation\nis parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. Recall that a\nwave on a rope is a transverse wave that causes the rope to move at\nright angles to the direction the wave is traveling.Exercise 6.2\nDid you recall the\ndifferences be-tween transverseand longitudinal\nwaves?\nLike all waves, an EM wave has a frequency and a wavelength. The num-\nber of times the electric and magnetic parts vibrate each second is the\nfrequency of the wave. The wavelength is the distance between the crests\nor troughs of the vibrating electric or magnetic parts."

In a mobile phone, they are made\nby a transmitter chip and an antenna; in a microwave oven, they are made\nby a \"magnetron\". Their wavelength is usually a couple of centimeters.\nStars also give off microwaves.\nMicrowaves cause water and fat molecules to vibrate which makes thesubstances hot. Thus, you can use microwaves to cook many types of\nfood. Mobile phones use microwaves, which can be generated by a small\nantenna. They are also used by trafﬁc speed cameras, and for radar, which\nis used by aircraft, ships and weather forecasters.\nProlonged exposure to microwaves is known to cause \"cataracts\" in your\neyes which is a clouding of the cornea. So do not make it a habit of pressing\nyour face against the microwave oven door to see if your food is ready.\nMicrowaves from mobile phones can affect parts of your brain as you are\nholding the transmitter right by your head.

You ﬁnd a structure called the iris behind the\ncornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of thepupil. The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light entering the\neye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object on the retina.\nThe retina is a delicate membrane with an enormous number of light-\nsensitive cells. The light-sensitive cells get activated upon illumination\nand generate electrical signals. These signals are sent to the brain via the\noptic nerves. The brain interprets these signals, and, ﬁnally, processes the\ninformation so that you perceive objects as they are.Key Concept\n/lefthandThe human\neye consists of a\nlens system thatfocuses imageson the retina,\nwhere the optic\nnerve transfersthe messages to\nthe brain.\nPower of accommodation\nThe eye lens is composed of a ﬁbrous, jelly-like material. The ciliary mus-\ncles can modify to some extent its curvatures. The change in the curvature\nof the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the muscles are re-\nlaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length increases. This enables\nus to see distant objects clearly. When you are looking at objects closer\nto the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This increases the curvature of\nthe eye lens. The eye’s lens then becomes thicker. Consequently, the focal\nlength of the eye lens decreases. This enables us to see nearby objects\nclearly.

The\nfarthest point up to which the eye can see objects clearly is called the far\npoint of the eye. It is inﬁnity for a normal eye.

Find the\nposition of the image, its nature, and its size.\n15. An object of size 7.0 cmis placed at 27 cmin front of a concave\nmirror of 18 cmfocal length. At what distance from the mirror\nshould a screen be placed, so that a sharp focused image can\nbe obtained? Find the size and the nature of the image.\n16. One-half of a convex lens is covered with a black paper. Will\nthis lens produce a complete image of the object? Verify your\nanswer experimentally. Explain your observations.\n17. An object 5 cmin length is held 25 cmaway from a converging\nlens of focal length 10 cm. Draw the ray diagram and ﬁnd the\nposition, size and nature of the image formed.\n18. A convex lens produces a virtual image which is four times\nlarger than the object. The image is 15 cmfrom the lens. What\nis the focal length of the lens?\n19. Compare and contrast primary light colors and primary pig-\nment colors.\n20. Determine the colors that are reﬂected from an object that\nappears black.\n21.
