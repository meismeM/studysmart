Cover the book with protective materials.2. Always keep the book in a clean dry place.3. Be sure your hands are clean when you use the book.4. Do not write on the cover or inside pages.5. Use a piece of paper or cardboard as a bookmark.6. Never tear or cut out any pictures or pages.7. Repair any torn pages with paste or tape.8. Pack the book carefully when you place it in your school \nbag.\n9. Handle the book with care when passing it to another \nperson.\n10.When using a new book for the first time, lay it on its back. Open only a few pages at a time. Press lightly along the bound edge as you turn the pages. This will keep the cover in good condition.Take Good Care of This \nTextbook"

In contrast, a quantity described by both a magnitude (the “how much” or “how big” part) and direction in space is a vector.\nDepending on their direction, magnitude and orientation we can categorize vectors as collinear, coplanar, parallel, antiparallel, equal, null, unit vector etc.\nGraphical method of vector addition makes use of translation of vectors.\nTriangle law – Vectors are connected head to tail to form a triangle. \nParallelogram law – vectors are connected tail to tail and a parallelogram is constructed using the vectors as its sides.\nPolygon law - used to /f_ind the resultant of more than two vectors. /T_he vectors are joined head to tail without regard to the order they are taken. /T_he vector drawn from the tail of the /f_irst vector to the head of the /f_inal vector represents the resultant. \nAnalytic methods of vector addition/subtraction allow us to /f_ind resultant of sums or diﬀerences of vectors without having to draw them. /T_hey are exact, contrary to graphical methods which are approximate. \n/T_he resultant of two vectors in the same direction has a magnitude equal to the sum of the magnitude of each of the vectors and it is directed along the direction of any one of the vectors.\n/T_he resultant of two vectors at right angles has a magnitude equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitude of each of the vectors and the direction of the resultant is determined by the angle it makes with respect to a reference line (commonly the x axis).\nA unit vector vector along the x axis is denoted by it and that along the y axis is \ndenoted by jt. A vector that is represented by its vector components as AA A xy=+vv v\ncan also be represented interms of its components as AA iA j xy=+v tt. \nIf Rv is the resultant of AandBv v then RR iR j xy=+v tt, where RA B xx x =+ and  \nRA B yy y =+ . /T_he angle that Rv makes with the x axis is tanRR\nxy 1i=-cm\n/T_he scalar product of two vectors AandBv vis de/f_ined as  .c os AB AB i =vvand also \nAB :vv=AxBx+AyBy. \n/T_he scalar product of two vectors can be used to determine the angle between the vectors and it can also be used to determine the component of one of the vectors in the direction of the other."

It includes the energy in all the/uni00A0chemical bonds. Internal energy increases with rising temperature and with/uni00A0changes of state/uni00A0or phase from solid to liquid and liquid to gas.\nHeat/uni00A0and/uni00A0work/uni00A0are two diﬀerent ways of transferring/uni00A0energy/uni00A0from one/uni00A0system/uni00A0to another. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between systems, while work is the transfer of mechanical energy between two systems. Heat can be transformed into work and vice verse, but they aren’t the same thing. Heat and work both contribute to the total internal energy of a system.\nConduction is/uni00A0the process by which heat energy is transmitted through collisions between neighboring atoms or molecules.\nConvection (or convective heat transfer) is/uni00A0the transfer of heat from one place to another due to the movement of /f_luid./uni00A0\nRadiation heat transfer/uni00A0occurs via electromagnetic waves. Unlike conduction and convection, radiation does not need a medium for transmission.\nHeat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of an object by 1\nC°. It is mathematically de/f_ined as \nQCT=∆\n     where Q is heat transferred to the object, /uni0394T is change in temperature of the object and C is heat capacity of the object. /T_he SI unit of C is joule per kelvin (J/K); you know that 1 J/K=1J/\nC°). \nSpeci/f_ic heat capacity is the change in temperature of a unit mass of a substance by 1o C. /T_he mathematical form of c is\nCcm= , or, QcmT=∆\n/T_he SI unit of speci/f_ic heat capacity is J/kg.oC, or J/kg.K.\n/T_hermal expansion/uni00A0is the tendency of matter to change in shape, volume, and area \nin response to a change in temperature. \n/T_hermal expansion of solids can be classi/f_ied in to three: linear expansion, surface (area) expansion and volume expansion.
