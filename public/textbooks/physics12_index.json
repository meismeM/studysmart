The combination of knowledge of physics and biology help to explain how\nathletes run fast and why the fastest animal in the world, cheetah, runs fast.\nNewtonian mechanics tells us that a body is in stable equilibrium under the\naction of gravity if its center of mass is directly over its base of support. Under\nthis condition, the reaction force at the base of support cancels the force of\ngravity and the torque produced by it. If the center of mass is outside the base,\nthe torque produced by the weight tends to fall the body. A person falls when his\ncenter of gravity is displaced beyond the position of the feet. The wider the base\non which the body rests and the closer the center of gravity of it to the base, the\nmore stable it is; that is, the more difﬁcult it is to fall it.

Specialized cells called neurons form\na complex network within the body which receives, processes, and transmits\ninformation from one part of the body to another. The center of this network\nis located in the brain, which has the ability to store and analyze information.\nBased on this information, the nervous system controls various parts of the body.\nThe messages are electrical pulses transmitted by the neurons.

Most of the electromagnetic\nradiation from the sun that reaches the Earth’s surface is in this region of the\nspectrum, and life has evolved to utilize it.

The astronomers’ only information about a\nparticular object comes through the light that it emits, and this light arises\nthrough atomic transitions.\nThe physics that explains emission and absorption of radiation is closely related\nto the structure and energies of individual atoms that form the astronomical\nobjects. When electrons of atoms jump from higher to a lower atomic orbit,\nphoton is emitted. Photon is absorbed if electron jumps from lower electron\norbit to higher electron orbit (Figure 1.5).\nThe emission and absorption of\nradiation depends on the characteristics of individual atoms, and helps to\nmeasure something about the compositions, temperatures, and motions of stars\nby studying their spectra. You can visit the link:\nhttps://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/hydrogen-atom to observe the Bohr\natomic model for hydrogen atom.\nIn the interstellar matter, atoms are heated by nearby stars. This results in\nknocking of electrons to higher energy orbits. These electrons fall down to lower\nenergy orbits emitting light of precisely the wavelength that corresponds to the\nenergy change between the two orbits. The nature of the emitted light depends\non the temperature. Thus, emitted light can be used to determine both\ncompositions and temperatures of astronomical objects."

The discovery of\nX-rays by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen in 1895 brought a revolution in the ﬁelds of\nscience and medicine and it has opened a path to a new interdisciplinary branch,\nmedical physics. The ﬁrst X-ray photograph was made by Roentgen himself in\nlate 1895 (Figure 1 .13).\nF\nigure 1.13 Wilhelm Conrad\nRoentgen0s hand ﬁrst x-ray imageMedical imaging refers to several different technologies that are used to view the\nhuman body in order to diagnose, monitor, or treat medical conditions. There are\nseveral imaging techniques that can provide imaging of biological samples. Some\ntechniques used for imaging are electromagnetic (optical, X-ray, magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI), thermography); other techniques are acoustic\n(ultrasound), chemical, and electrical. Among the most proliﬁc ones are MRI,\nX-ray computed tomography (CT scan), and high-frequency ultrasound.\nM\nagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\nF\nigure 1.14 An MRI image of the\nbrain. The MRI technique yields\ndetailed visualization of soft tissue\nstructures with a resolution of\nabout 0.5 mm.Magnetic resonance is absorption or emission of electromagnetic radiation by\nelectrons or atomic nuclei in response to the application of certain magnetic ﬁelds.\nMRI uses the physical principle of magnetic resonance that was ﬁrst described\nby Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell in 1946. Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansﬁeld\ndescribed how to acquire MR images from the human body.\nHow is MRI working? : Getting an MRI image depends upon the presence of\nprotons in the body. Protons are free hydrogen atom (proton without electrons).\nThey are abundant in the body as most part of our body consists of water which\ncontains two hydrogen and one oxygen atoms. With their net positive charge,\nprotons are small magnets each having a north and a south pole.\nD\niscussion\nquestion 1.5\nHow can magnetic\nvibration be used to\nform MRI image of\nthe body part and\nused for diagnosis?How do we get an image from these oscillation of ﬂipped hydrogen protons in the\nbrain? MRI uses the movement of these small magnets within a magnetic ﬁeld to\ngenerate an image. Within the constant magnetic ﬁeld of an MRI scanner, these\nsmall magnets arrange themselves parallel to constant magnetic ﬁeld. When a\ncurrent pulse (a current that ﬂows for very short period of time) is applied to\nthe patient’s tissue, this parallel arrangement of the small magnets is disturbed.\nWhen the current pulse is off the small magnets back to their parallel arrangement\nreleasing energy that they absorbed from the pulse. Different tissues in the body\ngive off different amounts of energy. A special device detects the released energy\nas an electrical current. The electrical current is transformed in to an image via a"

Because protons in the different kinds of tissues in the brain, such as\ngray matter, white matter and blood, all give off different amounts of energy, the\nresult of the transformed energy is a highly detailed image of the tissue inside the\nbrain.\nX-R\nay computerized tomography (CT) scan\nB\nrainstorming\nquestion 1.10\nDear student, share\nyour X-ray and CT\nscan diagnostic\nexperience.An X-ray imaging is based on the absorption of X-rays as they pass through the\ndifferent parts of a patient’s body. Differences in the densities of body tissue allow\nus to see inside the body by creating a shadow gram. The body is composed of\ntissues containing many different elements, which vary by atomic number (the\nnumber of protons in the nucleus). The higher the atomic number, the denser\nthe element and the more effectively the X-ray is blocked. For example, when\nX-ray strikes the calcium in cortical bone, it is blocked, and on the radiographic\nimage the bone will appear white. When an X-ray strikes less dense element like\nnitrogen, it passes all the way through. Therefore, the air-containing lung will\nappear darker, approaching black on the radiographic image. When a fracture\nextends through the bone, the fracture line will be dark while the intact bone will\nremain white.\nF\nigure 1.15 Relative arrangement\nand motion of X-ray source and\ndetectors in CT scan.\nF\nigure 1.16 Image of CT scan\nmachineDuring a regular X-ray procedure, a stationary machine sends X-rays through the\nbody to make a single shadow picture. A computed tomography (CT) scan uses\ncomputers and rotating X-ray machines to make many successive images (called\ntomograms) of the inside of body along different directions. In CT scan, the X-ray\nsource and the detectors rotate simultaneously in opposite direction as shown in\nFigure 1.18. A motorized table moves the patient (Figures 1 .15an d1 .16) through\na circular opening in the CT imaging system. As the patient passes through the\nCT imaging system, a source of X-rays rotates around the inside of the circular\nopening while the detectors on the other side of the patient record the X-rays\nexiting the section of the patient’s body being irradiated. The CT scan images\nprovide more detailed information than normal X-ray.\nD\niscussion question 1.6\nWhat\nis the basic difference between conventional X-ray and CT scan?"

What\nsimple equipment\ndo medical doctors\nuse to listen these\nsounds? What\ninformation could\ndoctors get from\nthese sounds?The most familiar clinical use of sound is in the analysis of body sounds with a\nstethoscope (Figure 1 .17). This instrument consists of a small bell-shaped cavity\nattached to a hollow ﬂexible tube. The bell is placed on the skin over the source\nof the body sound (such as the heart, intestines, or lungs). The sound is then\nconducted by the pipe to the ears of the examiner who evaluates the functioning\nof the organ. The stethoscope was developed in 1816 by a French physician, Rene\nLaennec. A stethoscope can be used to listen sounds made by the heart, lungs or\nintestines, as well as blood ﬂow in arteries and veins. A stethoscope can detect\nsound waves with frequency ranging from tens to thousands of Hertz.\nU\nltrasound\nF\nigure 1.17 StethoscopesIf the frequency of sound is higher than 20 KHz (0.02 MHz), it is called ultrasonic\nor ultrasound.

How can\nbe possible to do\nthis?The photons of X-rays and gamma-rays and the particles emitted by radioactive\nnuclei all have energies far greater than the energies that bind electrons to atoms\nand molecules. As a result, when such radiation penetrates into biological\nmaterials, it can rip off electrons from the biological molecules and produce\nsubstantial alterations in their structure.\nIn controlled doses radiation can be used therapeutically. In the treatment of\ncertain types of cancer, an ampul containing radioactive material such as radium\nor cobalt 60 is implanted near the cancerous growth. By careful placement of the\nradioactive material and by controlling the dose, the cancer cell can be destroyed\nwithout greatly damaging the healthy tissue.\nF\nigure 1.19 Radiotherapy of\nkidney cancer.An externally applied beam of gamma rays or X-rays can also be used to destroy\ncancerous tumors. The advantage here is that the treatment is administered\nwithout surgery 1. 19. The effect of radiation on the healthy tissue can be reduced\nby frequently altering the direction of the beam passing through the body. The\ntumor is always in the path of the beam, but the dosage received by a given\nsection of healthy tissue is reduced."

His observations of the planets and stars visible from\nEarth were carried out using only a large sextant and a compass. (The telescope\nhad not yet been invented.)\nGerman astronomer Johannes Kepler was Brahe’s assistant for a short while\nbefore Brahe’s death, where upon he acquired his mentor’s astronomical data.\nKepler spent 16 years trying to deduce a mathematical model for the motion of\nthe planets. Such data are difﬁcult to sort out because the moving planets are\nobserved from a moving Earth. After many lengthy calculations, Kepler found\nthat Brahe’s data on the revolution of Mars around the Sun led to a successful\nmodel. Kepler’s complete analysis of planetary motion is summarized in three\nstatements known as Kepler’s laws.\nK\nepler’s ﬁrst law\nKepler’s ﬁrst law is sometimes referred to as the law of ellipses. It states that the\norbit of a planet around the Sun is an ellipse (near circular, oval) with the Sun at\none focus (Figure 2 .20a).\nThe planet follows the ellipse in its orbit, meaning that the planet-to-Sun distance\nis constantly changing as the planet goes around its orbit. An ellipse is a closed\ncurve such that the sum of the distances from a point on the curve (r 1+ r2) to the\ntwo foci, f1and f2is constant, as shown in Figure 2 .20b .D\niscussion\nquestion 2.9\nThink of the planets\norbiting the Sun.\nDo all the planets\nmove at the same\nspeed?

It\ndescribes the speed at which any given planet will move while orbiting the Sun.\nBasically, it states that planets do not move with constant speed along their orbits.\nInstead, their speed varies so that the line joining the centers of the Sun and the\nplanet sweeps out equal area in equal times. The point at which a planet is\nnearest the Sun is called perihelion. The point of greatest separation is aphelion.\nHence Kepler’s second Law, a planet is moving fastest when it is at perihelion and\nslowest at aphelion.\nKepler’s second law states that each planet moves so that an imaginary line\ndrawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times interval.\nConsider Figure 2 .21. The time it takes a planet to move from position AtoB,\nsweeping out area A1,is exactly the time taken to move from position CtoD,\nsweeping area A2and to move from EtoF, sweeping out area A3. These areas are\nthe same: A1=A2=A3\nComparing the areas in the Figure 2.2 1and the distance traveled along the ellipse\nin each case, we can see that in order for the areas to be equal, the planet must\nspeed up as it gets closer to the Sun and slow down as it moves away.\nK\nepler’s Third lawD\niscussion\nquestion 2.10\nIn small groups\ndiscuss the\nfollowing questions.\nWhat is the period\nof Earth?\nWhat is meant by\nthe orbital period of\na planet?\nWhich planet has\nthe shortest orbital\nperiod: Earth or\nPluto?\nIs there a systematic\nrelationship\nbetween period\nand radius for the\nplanets?Kepler’s third law compares the orbital period and the average radius of orbit of a\nplanet to those of other planets. Unlike Kepler’s ﬁrst and second laws that\ndescribe the motion characteristics of a single planet, the third law makes a\ncomparison between the motion characteristics of different planets. The period\n(T) of a planet is the time for one complete revolution around the Sun.\nKepler’s third law implies that the period for a planet to orbit the Sun increases\nrapidly with the radius of its orbit. Thus we ﬁnd that Mercury, the innermost\nplanet, takes only 88 days to orbit the Sun. Earth takes 365 days, while Saturn\nrequires 10,759 days to do the same."

It is crucial, for example, in\ndetermining whether an object sinks or ﬂoats in a ﬂuid. It directly affects\npressure of ﬂuids (gases and liquids). Density is a much more useful physical\nquantity for gases.\nDensity, ½, is the mass, m, per unit volume, V, of any object. It is calculated by\ndividing the mass of an object by its volume.\n½Æm\nV(3.\n5)\nThe unit of density is kg/m3.\nDensity measures the mass of one cubic meter of a substance. For example, at\nsea level and 0±Cthe mass of 1.0 m3of air is 1.3 kg. We say that the density of air is\n1.3 kg/m3. If we had 2.0 m3of air at sea level, its mass would be 2.6 kg. Its density\nis still 1.3 kg/m3.\nThe density of most gases is proportional to pressure and inversely proportional to\ntemperature. Liquids and solids, on the other hand, are essentially incompressible\nsubstances, and the variation of their density with pressure is usually negligible.Ex\nercise 3.3\ntAn iron ball with\nradius 5.0 cm has\na mass of 2.0 kg.\nDetermine the ball’s\ndensity.D\niscussion\nquestion 3.2\nWhen three liquids\nwith densities\n½1Ç½2Ç½3are\nmixed together,\nwhich liquid will be\nat the top, middle\nand bottom layer?\nExam\nple 3.6\nAssume the following about a person: mass is 80 kg; dimensions are 1 .8mtall, 0.3\nm wide, and 0.1 m thick; and volume is VÆ1.8m£0.3m£0.1mÆ0.054 m3,"

The density of iron is about 2.5 times the density of aluminum. Density also\nindicates about the phase of the matter and its particles arrangement. The\ndensities of liquids and solids are roughly comparable, consistent with the fact\nthat their atoms are in close contact.\nUnderstanding density allows us to answer questions like: “why does oil form a\nﬁlm on water?” . If you pour oil into water or water into oil, they form layers (see\nFigure 3. 9 a). Independently of which ﬂuid is poured ﬁrst, the layer of oil is\nalways on top of the water.

The upward force exerted by a\nﬂuid on any immersed object is called a buoyant force . Where does this buoyant\nforce come from? Buoyant force is based on the fact that pressure increases with\ndepth in a ﬂuid. This means that the upward force on the bottom of an object in a\nﬂuid is greater than the downward force on the top of the object. There is a net\nupward, or buoyant force on any object in any ﬂuid (See Figure 3.\n20).\nBuoyant\nforce is also called up thrust force. How a buoyance force is exerted by gas\nparticle can be observed from the link:\nhttps://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/balloons-and-buoyancy .\nHow large is this buoyant force? To answer this question, think about what\nhappens when a submerged object is removed from a ﬂuid. The space it\noccupied is ﬁlled by ﬂuid having a weight Wf l. Since this weight is supported by\nsurrounding ﬂuid, the magnitude of buoyant force on an object must equal the\nweight of the ﬂuid displaced by the object.\nIt is a tribute to the Greek mathematician and inventor Archimedes (287–212\nF\nigure 3.20 Pressure variation\nwith depth resulting a buoyant\nforceB.C.) that he stated this principle long before concepts of force were well\nestablished.

This is called Bernoulli’s principle and stated as: The pressure\nthat a ﬂuid exerts on a surface decreases as the speed with which the ﬂuid moves\nacross the surface increases.\nFluid ﬂow has important implications in biological systems for example, in the\nﬂow of blood through blood vessels. The blood pressure against the wall of a\nvessel depends on how fast the blood is moving. Pressure is lower when the blood\nis moving faster. Similarly, a snoring sound occurs when air moving through the\nnarrow opening above the soft palate at the back of the roof of the mouth has\nlower pressure than nonmoving air below the palate (Figure 3\n.27).\nThe normal\nair pressure below the soft palate, where the air is not moving, pushes the palate\nclosed. When airﬂow stops, the pressures equalize and the passage reopens. The\nrhythmic opening and closing of the soft palate against the throat leads to the\nsnoring sound. Pressure is also very important in wind musical instruments."

At the subatomic level, electromagnetism is\nrelated to the electromagnetic force that causes the attraction and repulsion of\nelectrically charged particles. When electrically charged particles, such as\nelectrons, are put into motion, they create a magnetic ﬁeld. When these particles\nare made to oscillate, they create electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves.\nElectricity and magnetism have been known to humans for a long time. The\nrelationship between Electricity and magnetism was discovered in 1819 when,\nduring a lecture demonstration, Hans Christian Oersted found that an electric\ncurrent in a wire deﬂected a nearby compass needle. His experiment provided\nthe ﬁrst reproducible observation of a relationship between electricity and\nmagnetism, A current carrying wire produced a magnetic ﬁeld whose strength\nand direction depends on the amount of the current ﬂowing and direction of the\ncurrent. In the 1820s, further connections between electricity and magnetism\nwere demonstrated independently by Faraday and Joseph Henry (1797-1878).\nThey showed that an electric current can be produced in a circuit either by\nmoving a magnet near the circuit or by changing the current in a nearby circuit.\nThe discovery of electromagnetism marked the birth of modern science and\ntechnology.

In the early decades of the nineteenth century,\nexperiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few others established\nthe fact that electricity and magnetism are inter-related. They found that moving\nelectric charges produce magnetic ﬁelds. For example, an electric current\ndeﬂects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity. This naturally raises the\nquestions like: Is the converse effect possible? Can moving magnets produce\nelectric currents? Does the nature permit such a relation between electricity and\nmagnetism? The answer is yes. In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered that magnets\ncould be used to generate electricity. He showed that a changing or variable\nmagnetic ﬁeld can produce an electromotive force (emf). This e.m.f produces an\ninduced current in a closed circuit. We call this effect electromagnetic induction.\nThis discovery led Faraday to invent the dynamo (generator) through the use of\nelectromagnetic induction.

In semiconductor\nproduction, doping intentionally introduces impurities into the intrinsic (or\npure) semiconductor for the purpose of changing its electrical properties.

The\nextrinsic semiconductors are further classiﬁed as N-type and P-type\nsemiconductors, based on the type of atomic impurity added to the\nsemiconductors.\nN-type semiconductor: an extra electron is created by adding an element that\nhas more electrons in the outer shell of the atom (called valence electrons) than\nthe intrinsic semiconductor. These elements usually come from Group V in the\nperiodic table. Elements from Group V have ﬁve valence electrons one more than\nthe Group IV elements.

The rest is\noccupied by resistors and capacitors as their size increases with their value. The\nmost obvious advantage of the integrated circuit is its small size.

Due to the integrated circuit’s small size, it is used\nextensively in military and aerospace programs. The integrated circuit has also\ntransformed the calculator from a desktop to a handheld instrument. Computer\nsystems are now available in portable models because of integrated circuits. This\nsmall, integrated circuit consumes less power and operates at higher speeds than\na conventional transistor circuit.

In\nthe integrated circuit, internal components are connected permanently. The\ncomponents are formed at the same time, reducing the chance for error. After the\nintegrated circuit is formed, it is pretested before ﬁnal assembly.\nIntegrated circuits reduce the number of parts needed to construct electronic\nequipment.

High current generates\nexcessive heat, damaging the device. High voltage breaks down the insulation\nbetween the various internal components. Furthermore, integrated circuits\ncannot be repaired. This is because the internal components cannot be\nseparated. Therefore, problems are identiﬁed by individual circuit instead of by\nindividual component."

Two main\ntypes of signals encountered in practice are analog and digital.\nAn analog signal is any continuous signal representing some time-varying\nquantity. The voltage signals which vary continuously with time are called\ncontinuous or analog voltage signals. Figure 5 .24sho ws a typical voltage signal,\nvarying as a sinusoidal wave of 0 to 5 v. An analogue signal carries a smooth wave.\nAt any time, the voltage of the signal could take any value.\nA digital signal is a signal that is being used to represent data as a sequence of\ndiscrete values; at any given time, it can only take on, at most, one of a ﬁnite\nnumber of values. In most digital circuits, the digital signal can have two possible\nvalid values; this is called a binary signal or logic signal. They are represented by\ntwo voltage bands: one near a reference value (typically termed as ground or zero\nvolts), and the other a value near the supply voltage. It is either low or high. It\nnever has any other value. These two special voltages are given symbols. The low\nvoltage level is written as 0, while the high voltage level is written as 1.\nF\nigure 5.24 Analog and digital\nsignals.Using a computer, any information can be turned into a pattern of 0s and 1s.\nPictures, recorded music, text and motion pictures can all be turned into a string\nof 0s and 1s and transmitted or stored in the same way.
